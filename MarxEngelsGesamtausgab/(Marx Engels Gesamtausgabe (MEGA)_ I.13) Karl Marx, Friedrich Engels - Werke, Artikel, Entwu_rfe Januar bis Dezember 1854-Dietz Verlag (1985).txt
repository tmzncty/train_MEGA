on  s u ch  m a t t e rs  hinge  the  existence  of ministries  and of dynasties.  In Austria,

a  nation without k n o w l e d g e.  ( H e a r,  H e a r .)  Reverting  n ow  to  the  application 
of  this  state  of  things,  to  the  facts  before  u s,  I  h a ve  first  to  tell  you—and  it 
is  the  salient  matter—that  R u s s ia  has  no  force  to  effect  her  t h r e a t s,  and  t h at 
she  h as  calculated  merely  u p on  t he  facility  of  terrifying  y ou  by  groundless 
f e a r s,  t h at  she  h as  h ad  no  p u r p o se  w h a t e v er  of  m a k i ng  w ar  on  T u r k e y,  t h at 
she  h as  no  m e a ns  for  doing  so,  t h at  she  h as  n ot  e v en  m a de  disposition  for

she  might  o c c u py  her  p r o v i n c e s,  and  calculates  further  u p on  y ou  for  forcing 
from  t h at State  such compliance w i th insolent d e m a n ds  as  shall b r e ak up  the 
O t t o m an  E m p i r e.  (Hear,  hear.)  It  is  by  y o ur  E m b a s s a d or  in  Constantinople 
a nd  by  y o ur  s q u a d r on in  the  B o s p h o r us  t h at  she  is  a b o ut to  achieve her e n d s. 
A nd  h e re  I  must  a d v e rt  to  a  statement  m a de  by  my  gallant  friend  Colonel 
C h e s n e y,  and  at  t he  same  time  supply  an  omission  w h i ch  he  has  m a d e.  He 
stated, t h at as  matters  stood before t he  P r u th w as  c r o s s e d,  T u r k ey w as m o re

tertains  and  h as  e x p r e s s ed  of  t he  military  qualities  of  t he  T u r k s.  He  stated, 
e v en  at  the  p r e s e nt  m o m e n t,  and  w i th  all  the  i m m e n se  a d v a n t a g es  w h i ch y ou 
h a ve  enabled  R u s s ia  to  acquire,  he  w as  still  in  d o u bt  w h e t h er  T u r k ey  w as

y ou  grant  me  t wo  conditions—the  first,  t h at  y o ur  E m b a s s a d or  a nd  y o ur

with  shouts  of  laughter.  ( L a u g h t er  a nd  prolonged  cheering.)  I  h a ve  said  I 
w o u ld  r e v e rt  to  the  affair  of  Sinope,  or  as  it h as  b e en justly  t e r m e d,  t he  little 
5  N a v a r i n o.  I  d o n 't refer  to  t h at ungraceful  e v e nt in reference  to  our conduct— 
for  we  h a ve  d o ne  in  this  nothing  m o re  disgraceful  t h an  in  the  rest—but I refer 
to  it  as  bearing  u p on  t he  relative  strength  of  t he  t wo  parties.  So  considered, 
it  has  a d d ed  nothing  to  R u s s i a 's  p o w e r,  and  t a k en  nothing  from  that  of 
T u r k e y,  b ut  the  r e v e r s e.  It  has  placed  in  the  m o st  unmistakable  light  the 
justifiable  fears  of  the  R u s s i a ns  of  T u r k i sh  p r o w e s s.  H e re  we  h a ve  seen  a 
fact  without  parallel  e v en in  our  o wn naval  annals—frigates  laying t h e m s e l v es 
alongside  line-of-battle  ships,  and  c o m m a n d e rs  casting  the  t o r ch  into  t he 
p o w d er  magazine,  and  offering  t h e m s e l v es  up  for  h o l o c a u st  on  their  c o u n 
t r y 's  shrine.  W h at m ay  n ot  be  achieved  against  a G o v e r n m e nt w h i ch in e v e ry 
act,  a nd  especially  in  this,  is  t he  object  of  a b h o r r e n ce  and  disgust  to  e v e ry 
h u m an  being.  O b s e r ve  t h at  t he  maritime  force  of  T u r k ey  is  u n t o u c h e d;  n ot 
a  line-of-battle  ship,  n ot  a  steamer  has  b e en  sacrificed.  N ow  she  is  doubly 
insured  in  the  c o m m a nd  of  t he  Black  S ea  if  the  diplomatists  are  w i t h d r a w n; 
and  it  is  t h e y,  a nd  t h ey  alone,  w ho  h a ve  p r o d u c ed  t he  so-called  disaster  of 
Sinope.  B ut  that  disaster  w as  p r e p a r ed  for  another  e n d;  it  w as  as  a  rod  a nd 
a  goad  to  urge  the  lagging  b e a s ts  of  b u r d en  in  Paris  a nd  in  L o n d o n,  and  to 
drive  t h em  into  enforcing  t he  t e r ms  of  settlement  u p on  t he  belligerents. 
Before  I  e n t e r ed  this  meeting,  I  h e a rd  it  stated  by  a  gentleman  of  t he  C o m 
mittee,  that  it  w as  perfectly  c o m p e t e nt  for  E n g l a nd  and  F r a n ce  to  interpose 
b e t w e en t h em if t h ey e x p e c t ed by  so  doing to  secure  p e a c e. I k n ow t h at w h at 
he  h as  stated  is  t he  general  impression  t h r o u g h o ut  this  land,  b ut  I  did  not 
t he  less  on  that  a c c o u nt  listen  to  h im  with  horror.  W ho  g a ve  y ou  t he  right 
to  go  a b o ut  the  world  enforcing  p e a ce  by  a r m s?  It  is  o ne  thing  to  resist 
aggression,  it  is  another  thing  to  c o m m it  it.  ( H e a r,  h e a r !)  Y ou  c a n n ot inter-
p o se  even  to  save  T u r k e y,  save  by  declaring w ar  against Russia. Y o ur inter 
position,  h o w e v e r,  will  be  for  R u s s i a 's  behoof,  a nd  at  h er  dictation,  a nd  with 
the  effect  of  imposing  conditions  on  T u r k ey  w h i ch  m u st  bring  h er  fall  . .. 
In  y o ur  negotiations  y ou  will  p r o p o se  to  T u r k ey to  relieve  her from  h er  p a st 
treaties  with  R u s s ia  in  consideration  of  a  E u r o p e an  settlement.  T h is  h a s,

by  a  nation  w h i ch  h as  acclaims  r e a dy  for  e v e ry  perversion.  G o od  H e a v e n s! 
a  E u r o p e an  settlement!  T h at  is  w h at  T u r k ey  has  to  rely  upon.  Surely  your 
treaty  of  V i e n na  w as  a  E u r o p e an  settlement,  and  w h at  w as  the  result?  T h at

N o w,  p e r h a ps  your  G o v e r n m e nt believed this.  If it did,  it is  v e ry  strange t h at

At  last  the  m u r d er  is  out,  as  regards  t he  affair  of  Sinope.  T he  s t a t e m e n ts

t h at  t he  Russians  had  3  steam  t w o - d e c k e r s,  o ne  three-decker  and  680  guns 
on their  side  m o re  t h an  the Turkish forces.  So  considered the e v e nt of Sinope

b ut  the  r e v e r s e.  H e re  we  h a ve  seen  a  fact  w i t h o ut  parallel  e v en  in  o ur  o wn 
annals—frigates  laying  themselves  alongside  line-of-battle  ships,  and  c o m 
m a n d e rs  casting  the  t o r ch  into  t he  p o w d er m a g a z i ne  and  offering themselves 
up  for  holocaust on  their  c o u n t r y 's  shrine.  T he  real maritime force of T u r k ey 
is  u n t o u c h e d;  n ot  a  line-of-battle  ship,  n ot  a  steamer  having b e en  sacrificed. 
This  is  n ot  all.  According  to  the  last  intelligence  r e c e i v e d,  o ne  of  the  finest 
t h r e e - d e c k e rs  of  the  R u s s i an  fleet,  the  Rostislav,  a  120-gun  ship,  h as  b e en 
sunk  by  the  T u r k s.  This  fact,  k e pt  b a ck  hitherto  u n d er  t he  specious  p r e t e xt 
t h at the  Rostislav  did n ot  sink during the  action, b ut immediately afterwards, 
is  n ow  admitted  by  the  R u s s i a n s,  and  forms  a  good  set-off  against  the 
d e s t r o y ed  T u r k i sh  ships.  If  o ne  three-decker  w as  actually  sunk,  we  m ay

T he  letters  of  o ur  L o n d on  c o r r e s p o n d e n ts  a nd  the  E u r o p e an  journals  enable 
us  at  last  to  appreciate  in  all  its  bearings  t he  prolonged  struggle  b e t w e en t he 
T u r ks  and  R u s s i a n s,  of  w h i ch  T s h e t a l e,  a  small  village  nine  miles  n o r th  of 
5  Kalefat,  w as  the  arena.  N e xt to  the  fact t h at the  series  of  sanguinary  actions 
in  question  w as  characterized  by  great  b r a v e ry  a nd  that  the  T u r ks  c a me  off 
victors,  the  m o st  striking  feature  of  the  w h o le  is  that  it  is  w i t h o ut  practical 
result,  so  far  as  the  expulsion  of  the  R u s s i a ns  from  Wallachia is  c o n c e r n e d. 
This  c o m es  from  a  mistake  on  the  p a rt  of  the  T u r ks  to  w h i ch we  h a ve  m o re 
t h an  o n ce  h ad  occasion  to  direct  the  attention  of  our  r e a d e r s.  We  allude  to 
their  sending  a  separate  a r my  to  Kalefat,  in  order  to  shut  up  the  r o ad  to 
Servia,  while  the  p r e s e n ce  of  a  strong  a nd  c o n c e n t r a t ed  force  n e ar R u s t c h uk 
and  H i r s o va  would  h a ve  b e en the  b e st g u a r a n t ee  against the Russians  ventur 
ing  into  t h at p r o v i n c e.  S u ch a force w o u ld h a ve  m e n a c ed  the  c o m m u n i c a t i o ns 
of  any  Russian  a r my  marching  w e s t w a r d,  while  a  bridge  and  bridge-head  at 
Oltenitza or  s o m e w h e re  t h e r e a b o u t s, fortified like  that of  Kalefat,  could h a ve 
maintained  a  footing  for  t h em  on  t he  left  b a nk  of  t he  D a n u b e.  B ut  e v en 
w i t h o ut  that,  the  R u s s i a ns  could  n ot  c r o ss  t he  U p p er  D a n u be  and  m a r ch into 
Servia,  without leaving the  T u r ks to  c r o ss  t he L o w er D a n u be  and m a r ch u p on 
20  B u c h a r e s t.  Of  c o u r s e,  in  saying  this,  we  r e c k on  the  relative  strength  of  the 
parties  to  be  w h at  it is  in reality, and ascribe  a decided superiority of n u m b e rs 
to  the  T u r k i sh  a r my  of  Roumelia,  o v er  the  R u s s i an  a r my  of  Wallachia.

N ow  the  fact  is  t h at  t he  T u r ks  h a ve  u s ed  their  superiority  in the  v e ry w ay 
to  nullify  it  and  provide  for  being  finally  b e a t e n.  T h ey  did  n ot  c o n c e n t r a te

o r d e r ed  to  attack  the  Russians  while  y et  in  t he  act  of  concentrating  t h e m 
selves.  T he  b e st  w ay  to  do  this  w as  to  r e p e at  the  e x p e r i m e nt  of  Oltenitza. 
W hy  w as  not  this  d o n e?  T he  bridge  at  Kalefat  s t a n d s,  in  spite  of  winter  and 
floating  ice,  and  t h e re  w as  no  position  lower  d o wn  w h e re  a  similar  bridge 
and  bridge-head  could  be  erected.  Or  had  O m er  P a s ha b e en  o r d e r ed  to  k e ep

in  the  T u r k i sh  proceedings,  bold  and  clever  m e a s u r es  are  so  regularly  fol 
lowed  by  t he  m o st  palpable  sins  of  omission  and  c o m m i s s i on  t h at diplomatic

not  r e p e at  t he  Oltenitza  m o v e m e n t. 

Altogether  some  30,000  Russians  m u st  h a ve  b e en  sent  against  Kalefat,  for 
w i th  a  lesser  force  t h ey  would  hardly  h a ve  v e n t u r ed  to  attack  a  fortified 
position,  defended  by  a garrison of  10,000 m e n, w i th at least  10,000 m o re for 
p u r p o s es  of  r e s e r ve  or  sally.  At  least  one-half,  then,  of  the  Russian  active 
a r my  in  Wallachia  w as  concentrated  t h e r e.  W h e re  a nd  h ow  could  the  other 
half,  spread  over  a  long  line,  h a ve  resisted  a  T u r k i sh  force  crossing  at  Olte 
nitza,  Silistria  or  H i r s o v a?  And  if  the  c o m m u n i c a t i on  b e t w e en  Widdin  and

crossing  at  other  points.  T h us  t he  Russians  by  their  position  on  the  c h o rd

no  less  t h an behind  r a m p a r ts  and  ditches,  t h ey  c an fight well. T he m u r d e r o us 
character  of  the  e n c o u n t e rs  m ay  be  inferred  from  the  statement  of  a  letter 
from  Bucharest,  to  the  effect  that  in  the  e n g a g e m e n ts  o ne  w h o le  regiment

T he  Prince  c a n n ot  b ut  act  a  Prince's  p a r t,  a nd  w ho  was  ever  silly  e n o u gh 
to  suppose  he  w o u ld  n o t?  B ut  I  need  n ot  inform  your  r e a d e rs  of  the  utter 
i m p o t e n cy  to  which  British  Royalty  itself  has  b e en  r e d u c ed  by  t he  British 
oligarchy,  so  that,  for  instance,  K i ng  William  I V,  a  decided  foe  to  Russia, 
w as  forced  by  his  Foreign  Minister—a  m e m b er  of  t he  Whig  oligarchy—to 
act  as  a  foe  to  T u r k e y.  H ow  p r e p o s t e r o u s,  t h e n,  to  s u p p o se  Prince  Albert 
to  be  able  to  c a r ry  o ne  single  point  in  defiance  of  t he  Ministry,  e x c e pt  so 
far  as  little  C o u rt  affairs,  a  dirty  riband,  or  a  tinsel  star,  are  c o n c e r n e d!  U se 
is  m a de  of  his  absolutist  penchants  to  blind  t he  p e o p l e 's  e y es  as  to  the  plots 
and  treacheries  of  the  responsible  Ministers.  If  the  o u t c ry  and  attack m e a ns 
anything  it  m e a ns  an  a t t a ck  on  royalist  institutions.  If  t h e re  w e re  no  Q u e en 
t h e re  would  be  no  Prince—if  there  w e re  no  t h r o ne  there  would  be  no  C o u rt 
influences.  Princes  would  lose  their  p o w er  if t h r o n es  w e re  n ot t h e re to  b a ck 
t h e m,  and  for  them  to  lean  u p o n.  But,  n ow  m a r k!  the  p a p e rs  w h i ch  go  the 
farthest  in  their  "fearful  b o l d n e s s ,"  w h i ch  cry  t he  loudest  and  try  to  m a ke 
a  sort  of  political  capital  o ut  of  Prince  Albert,  are  t he  m o st  eager  in  their 
assertions  of  loyalty  to  the  t h r o ne  and  in  fulsome  adulation  of  t he  Q u e e n. 
25  As  to  the  T o ry  p a p e rs  this  proposition  is  self-evident.  As  to  the  radical 
Morning  Advertiser,  it  is  t he  s a me  j o u r n al  w h i ch  hailed  B o n a p a r t e 's  c o up 
d'état,  and  recently  attacked  an  Irish  p a p er for having d a r ed to find fault w i th 
t he  Q u e e n,  on  the  occasion  of  her  p r e s e n ce  at Dublin,  which r e p r o a c h es  t he 
F r e n ch  Revolutionists  with  professing  Republicanism,  and  continues 
designate  L o rd  P a l m e r s t on  as  t he  savior  of England.  T he whole  is  a Palmer-
stonian  trick.  P a l m e r s t o n,  by  the  revelations  of  his  Russianism  and  his 
opposition  to  the  n ew  R e f o rm  Bill,  has  b e c o me  unpopular.  T he  latter  act  h as

T he  fortification  of  Constantinople  w o u ld  b e,  as  I  stated  in  my  last  letter, 
t he  m o st  important  step  t he  T u r ks  could  t a k e.  Constantinople  o n ce  fortified, 
5  with  suitable  strengthening  of  t he  forts  on  t he  B o s p h o r us  and  Dardanelles, 
the  i n d e p e n d e n ce  of  T u r k e y,  or  of  a ny  p o w er  holding  t h at  capital,  w o u ld 
require  no  foreign g u a r a n t e e.  T h e re  is  no  t o wn m o re  e a sy  to  be fortified t h an 
Constantinople.  O ne  single  side  of  t he  triangle  only—the  o ne  t o w a rd  t he

10  M a r m o r a,  a nd  t he  third,  t o w a rd  t he  G o l d en  H o r n,  require  no  fortifications. 
A  line  of  d e t a c h ed  forts,  at  a  c o n v e n i e nt  distance  from  the  enceinte,  a nd

S u ch  a  fortress  w o u ld  be  almost impregnable.  Its  c o m m u n i c a t i o ns  c a n n ot

T he reply of R u s s ia to  t he  declaration of  neutrality on the p a rt of D e n m a rk

T he  general  deficiency  of  the  E u r o p e an  Grain  m a r k e ts  m ay  be  stated  as 
follows:  t he  deficiency  of  grain  in  F r a n ce  in  place  of  being  t en  millions  of 
hectolitres,  as  stated  by  the  Moniteur,  to  calm  t he  alarm,  greatly  e x c e e ds 
t w e n ty  millions,  t h at is,  more  t h an  eight  million  q u a r t e rs  of English m e a s u r e; 
and  the  deficiency  of  p o t a t o es  is  not  less  t h an  one-fourth  of  the  average  of 
t he  last  five  y e a r s,  while  t he  deficiency  in  w i n e,  oil  a nd  c h e s t n u ts  is  yet  25 
greater.  T he  deficiency  in  the  p r o d u ce  of  c o rn  in  Belgium  and  Holland  is 
a b o ut  four  millions  of  hectolitres;  that  of  t he  R h i ne  P r o v i n c e s,  Prussia  a nd 
Switzerland,  at  a  m o d e r a te  estimate,  is  t a k en  to  e x c e ed  ten  million  hectoli 
t r e s.  T he  estimated  deficiency  in  Italy  is  k n o wn  to  be  v e ry  great,  b ut  t h e re 
is  greater  difficulty  in  arriving  at  e v en  a  p r o x i m a te  result.  T he  lowest  esti- 
m a t e,  h o w e v e r,  gives  t en  millions  of  hectolitres  of  grain,  or  a  deficiency 
t h r o u g h o ut  the  great  grain  producing districts  of  W e s t e rn E u r o pe  of  n ot less 
t h an  forty-four  millions  of  hectolitres,  ( s e v e n t e en  million  quarters.)  T he 
deficiency  in  England  is  k n o wn  to  e x c e ed five  million  q u a r t e rs  of  grain,  and 
calculations w o r t hy of grave consideration give t h at a m o u nt as the deficiency 
in  w h e at  alone.  T h us  there  is  a fatal  deficiency  in  t he  last h a r v e st  in  W e s t e rn 
E u r o pe  alone  of  no  less  t h an t w e n t y - t wo  million q u a r t e r s,  without taking into 
a c c o u nt  t he  great  inferiority  a nd  short-coming  of  other  cereals,  and  t he 
general  p r e v a l e n ce  of  the  potato-rot—a deficiency  w h i c h,  if  valued  in w h e a t, 
m u st be equal to at least five million q u a r t e r s, or a grand total of t w e n t y - s e v en

I  w as  able  to  see  the  State  procession  of  the  Q u e en  to  o p en  Parliament,  as

w as  sparing  of  her  usual  salutes  and  morbidly  smiled  at  the  u n w o n t ed

As  to  the  Russian  E x c h e q u e r,  I  h ad  on  a  previous  occasion,  at  the  b e

subject  to  v e ry  great  fluctuations,  which  c o m m e n c ed  troubling  the  Cabinet

F r om  O ur  O wn  C o r r e s p o n d e n t. 

L o n d o n,  F r i d a y,  F e b.  10,  1854. 

At  t he  time  w h en  the  treaty  of  neutrality  w as  c o n c l u d ed  b e t w e en  D e n m a rk 
and  S w e d e n,  I  stated  my  conviction,  c o n t r a ry  to  t he  c u r r e nt  opinion  in 
E n g l a nd  and  F r a n c e,  that  it  w as  not  by  a ny  m e a ns  to  be  looked  u p on  as  a 
t r i u m ph  of  t he  W e s t e rn  P o w e r s,  and  t h at  t he  p r e t e n d ed  p r o t e st  of  R u s s ia 
against  t h at  treaty  w as  nothing  b ut  a feint.  T he  Scandinavian p a p e r s,  and  The 
T i m e s ' c o r r e s p o n d e n t,  quoting  from  t h e m,  are  n ow  u n a n i m o us  in  recording 
the  s a me  opinion,  declaring  the  whole  t r e a ty  to  be  t he  w o rk  of  Russia. 

T he  propositions  submitted  by  C o u nt  Orloff  to  the  V i e n na  C o n f e r e n c e, 

a nd  rejected  by  t h e m,  w e re  as  follows: 

1.  R e n e w al  of  the  old  treaties. 
2.  P r o t e c t o r a te  of  R u s s ia  over  t he  G r e ek  Christians  of  T u r k e y. 
3.  Expulsion  of  all  political  refugees  from  the  O t t o m an  E m p i r e. 
4.  Refusal  to  admit  the  mediation  of  any  o t h er  P o w e r,  and  to  negotiate 
o t h e r w i se  t h an  directly  with  a  T u r k i sh  E n v o y,  to  be  sent  to  St. P e t e r s 
burg. 

On t he  latter  point  C o u nt  Orloff  declared his r e a d i n e ss to  c o m p r o m i s e, b ut 
t he  Conference  refused.  W hy  did  the  Conference  refuse?  Or  w hy  did  the 
E m p e r or  of  R u s s ia  refuse  the last t e r ms  of  t he  C o n f e r e n c e? T he propositions 
are  the  same  on b o th  sides.  T he  r e n e w al  of t he  old  treaties  h ad  b e en  stipulat 
ed,  t he  R u s s i an  P r o t e c t o r a te  admitted  with  only  a  modification  in  t he f o r m; 
and,  as  t he  last  point  h ad  b e en  a b a n d o n ed  by  R u s s ia  herself,  t he  Austrian 
d e m a nd  for  the  expulsion  of  the  refugees  could  n ot  h a ve  b e en  t he  c a u se  of 
a  r u p t u re  b e t w e en  Russia  and  the  West.  It  is  evident,  t h e n,  that t he  position 
of  the  E m p e r or  of  Russia  is  n ow  such  as  to  p r e v e nt  him  from  accepting  any 
t e r ms  at  t he  h a n ds  of  E n g l a nd  a nd  F r a n c e,  and  t h at  he  m u sí  bring  T u r k ey 
to  his  feet  either  with  or  without  the  c h a n ce  of  a  E u r o p e an  w a r. 

In  military  circles  the  latter  is  n ow  regarded  as  inevitable,  and the p r e p a r a-

for Algiers,  w h e re  he  is  to  e m b a rk  10,000 m en a nd  sixteen English Regiments 
stationed  in  Ireland  are  o r d e r ed  to  hold  t h e m s e l v es  r e a dy  to  go  to  Con 
stantinople.  T he  expedition  c an  only  h a ve  a  twofold  object:  either  to  c o e r ce 
t he  T u r ks  into  submission to Russia,  as  Mr.  U r q u h a rt  a n n o u n c e s,  or to  c a r ry 
on  the  w ar  against  Russia  in  real  earnest.  In  b o th  c a s es  the  fate  of  the  T u r ks 
is  equally  certain.  O n ce  more  h a n d ed  over  to  Russia,  not  indeed  directly, b ut 
to  her  dissolving  agencies,  the  p o w er  of  the  O t t o m an  E m p i re  w o u ld  s o on 
be  r e d u c e d,  like  t h at  of  the  L o w er  E m p i r e,  to  t he  precincts  of  the  capital. 
10  T a k en  u n d er  the  absolute  tutorship  of  F r a n ce  a nd  England  the  sovereignty 
of  t he  O t t o m a ns  over  their  E u r o p e an  e s t a t es  would  be  no  less  at  an  end.  If 
we  are  to  take  the  w ar  into  our  h a n d s,  o b s e r v es  The  Times,v/e  m u st h a ve  t he 
control  over  all  the  operations.  In this  c a se  t h e n,  t he  T u r k i sh  Ministry  would 
be  placed  under  the  direct  administration  of  the  W e s t e rn  E m b a s s a d o r s,  t he

T u r k i sh  E m p i r e,  in  its  ancient  conditions  of  existence,  has  c e a s ed  to  b e. 

After  his  complete  " f a i l u r e"  at  V i e n n a,  C o u nt  Orloff  is  n ow  gone  b a ck to 
St.  Petersburg—"with  t he  a s s u r a n ce  of  t he  A u s t r i an  a nd  Prussian  neutrality, 
u n d er  all  c i r c u m s t a n c e s ."  On  the  other  h a n d,  the  telegraph  r e p o r ts  from 
V i e n na  that  a  change  has  t a k en  place  in  t he  T u r k i sh  Ministry,  the  Seraskier 
and  K a p u d an  P a s ha  having  resigned.  The  Times c a n n ot  u n d e r s t a nd  how  the 
w ar  p a r ty  could  h a ve  b e en  defeated  at  the  v e ry t i me t h at F r a n ce  and  England 
w e re  going to w a r.  F or my p a r t, if the  n e ws  be t r u e,  I c an v e ry well u n d e r s t a nd 
the  " g o d - s e n t"  o c c u r r e n ce  as  t he  w o rk  of  t he  English  Coalition  r e p r e s e n t a 
tive  at  Constantinople,  w h om  we  find  so  repeatedly  regretting,  in  his  b l u e-
b o ok  dispatches,  t h at  " he  could  hardly  yet  go  so  far  in  his  p r e s s u re  on  t he

T he  blue  b o o ks  begin  with d i s p a t c h es  relating  to  the  d e m a n ds  put  forward

enforce  t he  s u p r e m a cy  of  t he  L a t in  over  the  G r e ek  C h u r c h.  I  am  far  from 
participating in t he opinion of Mr. U r q u h a r t,  according to w h i ch the  Czar h a d, 
by  secret  influences  at  Paris,  seduced  B o n a p a r te  to  r u sh  into  this  quarrel  in

"If  Austria  wished  to  assist  the  M o n t e n e g r i n s,  t he  blockade  could  n ot

of  t he  p r e s e nt  incursion  of  t he  M o n t e n e g r i n s,  nor  of  the  revolution  which 
is  on  the  eve  of  breaking  out  in  Herzegovina  and  Bosnia  among  the  Chris

80,000  m en  at  Strasburg.

III.  Prussia  d o es  not  object  to  the  assembling  of  a  F r e n ch  a r my  of 
100,000  m en  on  t he  frontier  of  S a v o y,  b ut  she  considers  t he  concentration 
of  an  a r my  at  M e t z,  and  of  another at Strasburg, to be  a direct m e n a ce  against 
herself.  She  already  fancies  B a d e n,  H e s s e,  W u r t e m b e r g,  etc.,  in  full  in- 
surrection  a nd  s o me  100,000  p e a s a n ts  marching  from  t he  south  of  G e r m a ny

u r e s,  and  it  is  this  eventuality w h i ch is  alluded to  in  section 3  of  the P r u s s i an

p e r h a ps  before,  the  end  of  M a r c h.  She  intends  calling o ut  a force  of  200,000

concentrating  the  two  armies  at  M e tz  and  Strasburg,  t he  Prussian  G o v e r n 
m e nt  has  already  resolved  to  augment  its  force  to  500,000  men.  In  the  Berlin

mal  alliance  with  England,)  fear  and confusion are  a s s e r t ed to  reign s u p r e m e. 
T h e re  exists  already  a formal  resolution  of  t he  Cabinet (Cabinets-Beschluss) 
according  to  which,  u n d er  certain  c i r c u m s t a n c e s,  all  t he  m o re  notorious 
d e m o c r a ts  of  the  m o n a r c h y,  and,  a b o ve  all,  of  R h e n i sh  Prussia,  are  to  be 
arrested  on  t he  same  night,  and  to  be  t r a n s p o r t ed  to  t he  e a s t e rn  fortresses,

(die  Umsturzpläne  Napoleons!!)  or  from  getting  up  p o p u l ar  m o v e m e n ts

of Italian disorders breaking out,  or if  N a p o l e on  c o n c e n t r a t es t he t wo armies

steps  they  would  be  obliged  to  t a k e,  P o z zo  di  Borgo  continues  as  follows: 

"It  would  be  advisable  to  communicate  all  these  acts  to  the  United  States 
of America  as  an  evidence  of  the  regard  of  the  Imperial  Cabinet,  and of the 
importance  which  it  attaches  to  enlightening  its  opinion  and  even  obtaining

N o w,  as  the  R u s s i an  historian  K a r a m s in  justly  r e m a r ks  that  " n o t h i ng

As  I  am  quoting  t he  m o st  celebrated  of  P o z zo  di  B o r g o 's  d i s p a t c h e s, I m ay

f o r w a r d ed  to  the  Admirals,  and  t h at the  latter  are  really  incapable  of  execut

N ow  look  at  another  m o st  important point.  T he  e m b a r k a t i on  of the British

in  the  F r e n ch  alliance;  to  his  accusing  F r a n ce  of  having  b e t r a y ed  England 
in  1840,  while  in  fact  t he  English  G o v e r n m e nt  at  t h at  time  conspired  with 
N i c h o l as  against  Louis  Philippe.  I  ought  to  h a ve  a d d ed  that  the  second 
Adrniral  in  t he  Black  Sea,  Sir  E d m u nd  L y o n s,  during  his  stay  in  G r e e ce  as 
English  Minister,  s h o w ed  himself  the  a v o w ed  e n e my  of  F r a n c e,  a nd  w as 
r e m o v ed  from  t h at  office  on  the  representations  of  L o rd  Stratford  de  R e d- 
cliff e. T h us in t he ministerial appointments t he greatest possible c a re is t a k en

Constantinople. 

T h e se  facts  are  n ot  denied  and  certainly  n ot refuted  by  B o n a p a r t e 's  con-

certainly  s o m e w h at  older  t h an  the  restoration  of  t he  Imperial  etiquette.  T he 
m o st  r e m a r k a b le  passage  in  B o n a p a r t e 's  speech  is  neither  this  reminiscence 
from  L o u is  Philippe's  h a r a n g u e s,  nor  his  denunciation  of  t he  C z a r 's  ambi-

especially  of  Austria,  against  t he  foe  from  without  a nd  the  e n e my  from

It  is  n ow  ascertained  t h at  the  d i s c o v e ry  of  t he  conspiracy  at  Widdin  only 
h a s t e n ed  t he  G r e ek  explosion,  w h i ch  at  B u c h a r e st  w as  considered  as  an 
accomplished  fact  before  it  h ad  b r o k en  out.  T he  P a s ha  of  Scutari  is  con 
centrating  all  his  t r o o ps  with a v i ew to  p r e v e nt t he  Montenegrins  from joining 
the  insurgent  G r e e k s. 

T he  A n g l o - F r e n ch  expedition  m ay  be  set  d o w n,  as  far  as  t he  present 
intentions  of  the  British  G o v e r n m e nt  go,  as  a n o t h er  piece  of  h u m b u g.  T he 
landing  places  are  fixed  for  the  F r e n c h,  at  R o d o s t o,  for  the  British  at E n o s. 
T h is  latter  t o wn  lies  on  a  small  peninsula  at  t he  e n t r a n ce  of  a  m a r s hy  b a y, 
at  the  rear  of  which  the  extensive  m a r s h es  of  the  valley  of  the  Maritza, will 
no  doubt  greatly  contribute  to  t he  salubrity  of  t he  c a m p.  It  lies  outside  n ot 
only  of  the  B o s p h o r u s,  b ut  of  the  Dardanelles  also,  and  the  t r o o p s,  in o r d er 
to  get  to  t he  Black  Sea,  would  h a ve  either  to  r e ë m b a rk  a nd  enjoy  250  miles 
r o u n d - a b o ut  sail  against  the  c u r r e n ts  of  the  Straits,  or  to  m a r ch  t h r o u gh  a 
r o a d l e ss  c o u n t ry  for t he  distance  of  160  miles,  a  m a r ch  which no d o u bt could 
be  completed  in  a  fortnight.  T he  F r e n ch  are  at  R o d o s t o,  at  least  on  the  sea 
of  M a r m o r a,  a nd  only  a  w e e k 's  m a r ch  from  Constantinople. 

B ut w h at  are  the  t r o o ps  to  do  in  this  inexplicable position? W h y, t h ey are 
either  to  m a r ch  u p on  Adrianople,  t h e re  to  c o v er  t he  capital,  or  in  t he  w o r st 
c a s e,  to  unite  at the  n e ck of  the  T h r a c i an  C h e r s o n e s u s,  to  defend  the  D a r d a 
nelles.  So  says  The  Times,  " by  a u t h o r i t y ,"  a nd  e v en  q u o t es  Marshal  Mar 
m o n t 's  strategic  o b s e r v a t i o ns  in  s u p p o rt  of  t he  w i s d om  of  the  plan.

O ne  h u n d r ed  t h o u s a nd  F r e n ch  a nd  English  t r o o ps  to  defend  a  capital 
w h i ch  is  n ot  m e n a c e d,  which  c a n n ot  possibly  be  m e n a c ed  for  the  n e xt 
t w e l v e m o n t h!  W h y,  t h ey  might  as  well  h a ve  s t o p p ed  at  h o m e. 

This  plan,  if  it  is  to  be  carried  out,  is  decidedly  the  w o r st  t h at  can  be 
devised.  It  is  b a s ed  u p on  t he  v e ry  w o r st  sort  of  defensive  warfare,  viz:  t h at 
40  w h i ch  seeks  strength  in  absolute  inactivity.  Supposing  the  expedition  w as 
to  be  of  a  mainly  defensive  character,  it  is  evident  t h at  this  object w o u ld be

R o d o s to  t he  F r e n ch  a nd  British  t r o o ps  are  entirely  u s e l e s s. 

T he  w o r st  of  it  is,  t h at  an  a r my  of  100,000  m e n,  with  plenty  of  steam 
t r a n s p o r t s,  a nd  supported  by  a  fleet  of  t w e n ty  sail  of  t he  line,  is  in  itself  a

of  t he  first  divisions  at  E n os  and  R o d o s to  is  merely  c o n t r i v ed to  deceive  the

a n n o u n c ed  expedition  of  100,000  m e n,  he  is  b o u nd  to  send  every  soldier  he

I,  t h e r e f o r e,  believe  that  those  w ho  h a ve  p l a n n ed  the  expedition  intend 

betraying  t he  Sultan  directly,  and,  on t he  plea of  frightening R u s s ia as  m u ch

E n g l a nd  a nd  F r a n ce  occupying  Constantinople  a nd  p a rt  of  Rumelia;

being  allowed  to  reënforce  herself  in  Moldo-Wallachia,—this  looks  like  an 
e v e n t u al  partition  of  T u r k ey  in  E u r o pe  rather  t h an  anything  else.  T u r k ey  is 
placed  in  w o r se  circumstances  t h an  in  1772,  w h en  t he  K i ng  of  Prussia,  in

last  dispatches  from  V i e n na  a s s u m ed  m o re  threatening  dimensions  on  t he

5  Delonia  are  said  to  be  in  a  state  of  revolt.  An  insurrection  is  stated  to  h a ve 
b r o k en  out  at Egrippo the  capital of E u b ö a,  equal in gravity to  that in Albania. 
T he  fact  of  the  t o w ns  of  A r ta  and  J a n i na  being  quitted  by  t he  T u r ks  a nd 
occupied by the  G r e e ks  is  of  smaller  i m p o r t a n c e, as the domineering citadels

T he Gulfs  of  C o n t e s sa and  Salónica a nd t he c o a s ts  of Albania will be  declared

the  opportunity  it  afforded  t he  W e s t e rn  P o w e rs  for  interfering  b e t w e en  t he 
Sultan  and  his  subjects,  instead  of  fighting  t he  R u s s i a n s,  a nd  t h us  driving

As  to  D o st  M a h o m e d,  the  A m e er  of  Cabul,  it  w o u ld  be  quite  natural  t h at 

after  having  p r o p o s ed  in  1838  to  E n g l a nd  to  place  forever  a  feud  of  blood 
b e t w e en  himself  a nd  Russia,  if  t he  English  G o v e r n m e nt  required  it,  by 
causing  t he  agent  dispatched  to  h im  by  t he  C z ar  to  be  killed,  a nd  being 
r e n e w ed  in  1839  on  the  p a rt  of  England  by  t he  Affghan  expedition,  by  his 
expulsion  from  t he  t h r o ne  a nd  by  t he  most cruel  and u n s c r u p u l o us  devasta 
tion  of  his  country—that  D o st  M a h o m ed  should  n ow  e n d e a v or  to  avenge 
himself  u p on  his  faithless  ally.  H o w e v e r,  as  t he  population  of  K h i v a,  B o 
k h a ra  and  Cabul,  belong  to  t he  o r t h o d ox  M u s u l m an faith  of  the  Sunni,  while 
t he  Persians  a d h e re  to  t he  schismatic  t e n e ts  of  t he  Schii,  it  is  n ot  to  be 
supposed  t h at  t h ey  will  ally  t h e m s e l v es  w i th  Russia,  being  t he  ally  of  t he

T h e re  is  s o me  probability  of  R u s s ia  having  an  ally in T h i b et  and t he T a r t ar 
E m p e r or  of  China,  if  t he  latter  be  forced  to  retire  into  M a n c h o u r ia  and  to

from

of  c o u r se  increased  the  tax-paying  p o w er  of  t he  c o u n t ry  a nd  t he  r e v e n ue 
derived  from  the  land  t a x.  At  the  same  time  the  abolition  of  the  patrimonial 
c o u r ts  brought  the  income,  which  the  aristocracy h ad formerly enjoyed from 
their  private  administration  of  justice,  into  t he  coffers  of  the  State,  a nd  this 
b r a n ch  of  r e v e n ue  has  b e en  constantly  increasing  since  1849.  T h en  a  con- 
siderable  increase  a r o se  from  the  income-tax,  introduced  by  the  p a t e nt  of

T he  basis  of  t he  w h o le  Austrian  system  of  taxation  m ay  be  said  to  be  the 
land-tax.  On  the  1st  April  1812,  a p p e a r ed  an  imperial  p a t e n t,  in  w h i ch  the 
E m p e r or  F r a n c is  a n n o u n c ed  his  resolution  to  establish  uniformity  in  the 
land-tax  s y s t em  all  over  his  G e r m a n,  Slavonic  a nd  Italian  provinces.  In  o ne 
p a r a g r a ph  of  this  patent  it  is  ordered  t h at  no  e x e m p t i o ns  from  the  land-tax 
should  in future  " be  m a de  according to t he p e r s o n al quality of t he p o s s e s s o rs 
of  e s t a t es  or  h o u s e s ,"  and  as  a  w h o le  this  view  w as  acted  u p o n.  In  t he 
A r c h d u c hy  of  Austria,  the  n ew  survey  w as  introduced  in  1834,  a nd this  w as 
the  first hereditary  domain  in w h i ch  the  n ew  system  w as  b r o u g ht into  o p e r a

Constitution—ceased  to  w o rk  after  the  H u n g a r i an  revolution  w as  quelled  by

of  H u n g a ry  on t he  1st  of  O c t o b e r,  1850,  the  Austrian  M o n a r c hy c a me to form

t he  t o b a c co  monopoly  w e re  also  i n t r o d u c ed  t h e re  on  M a r ch  1,  1851.  T he 
increase  of  the  direct  t a x es  alone  in  the  H u n g a r i an  P r o v i n c es  a m o u n t ed  to 
11,500,000  florins  in  1851,  and  to  a b o ut  8,000,000  florins  in  1852. 

We  arrive  then  at  the  irrefragable  conclusion,  t h at  on  the  possession  of 
H u n g a ry  and  L o m b a r dy  d e p e n ds  n ot  only  t he  political  b ut  t he  e c o n o m i c al

I  regret  deeply  to  be  unable,  for  the  m o m e nt  at  least,  to  leave  L o n d o n,  a nd 
t h us  to  be  p r e v e n t ed  from  expressing  verbally  my  feelings  of  pride  a nd 
gratitude on receiving the invitation to  sit as H o n o r a ry Delegate at t he L a b o ur 
Parliament.  T he  m e re  assembling  of  such  a  Parliament  m a r ks  a  n ew  e p o ch 
in  the  history  of  the  world.  T he  n e ws  of  this  great fact will  arouse  the  h o p es 
of  t he  working  classes  t h r o u g h o ut  E u r o pe  and  America. 

G r e at  Britain,  of  all  other  countries,  has  s e en  developed  on  the  greatest 
scale,  the  d e s p o t i sm of Capital a nd t he slavery of L a b o u r. In no other c o u n t ry 
h a ve  the  intermediate  stations  b e t w e en  t he  millionaire  c o m m a n d i ng  w h o le 
industrial  armies  and  t he  wages-slave  living  only  from  h a nd  to  m o u th  so 
gradually  b e en  s w e pt  a w ay  from  t he  soil.  T h e re  exist  h e re  no  longer,  as  in 
continental  countries,  large  classes  of  p e a s a n ts  a nd  artisans  almost  equally 
d e p e n d e nt  on  their  o wn  p r o p e r ty  a nd  their  o wn  labour.  A  complete  divorce 
of  p r o p e r ty  from  labour  has  b e en  effected  in  G r e at  Britain.  In  no  other 
c o u n t r y,  therefore,  the  w ar  b e t w e en  t he  t wo  classes  t h at  constitute  m o d e rn 
society  h as  a s s u m ed  so  colossal  dimensions  a nd  features  so  distinct  a nd 
palpable. 

B ut  it  is  precisely  from  t h e se  facts  t h at  the  w o r k i ng  classes  of  G r e at 
Britain,  before  all  o t h e r s,  are  c o m p e t e nt  a nd  called  for  to  act  as  leaders  in 
the  great  m o v e m e nt  that  m u st  finally  result  in  t he  absolute  emancipation  of 
L a b o u r.  S u ch  t h ey  are  from  t he  c o n s c i o us  clearness  of  their  position,  t he 
v a st  superiority  of  their  n u m b e r s,  t he  disastrous  struggles  of  their  past,  and 
t he  moral  strength  of  their  present. 

It  is  t he  working  millions  of  G r e at  Britain  w ho  first  h a ve  laid  d o wn  t he 
real  basis  of  a  n ew  society—modern  industry,  w h i ch  transformed  t he 
destructive  agencies  of  n a t u re into t he p r o d u c t i ve p o w er of m a n.  T he  English 
working  classes,  with  invincible  energies,  by  t he  s w e at  of  their  b r o ws  a nd 
b r a i n s,  h a ve  called  into  life  the  material  m e a ns  of  ennobling  labour  itself, 
a nd  of  multiplying  its  fruits  to  such  a  degree  as  to  m a ke  general  a b u n d a n ce

By  creating  the  inexhaustible  productive  p o w e rs  of  m o d e rn industry  t h ey

of  their  o wn  subjugation.

Of  all  countries  G r e at  Britain  has  seen  d e v e l o p ed  on  the  grandest  scale  the 
d e s p o t i sm  of  capital  a nd  t he  slavery  of  labor.  In  no  other  c o u n t ry  h a ve  t he 
intermediate  degrees  b e t w e en  the  millionaire,  c o m m a n d i ng whole  industrial 
armies,  and  t he  wages-slave  living only from h a nd to  m o u t h,  so  radically b e en 
s w e pt  a w ay  from  t he  soil.  T h e re  exist  no  longer,  as  in  continental  countries, 
large  classes  of  p e a s a n ts  a nd  artizans  almost  equally  d e p e n d e nt  on their o wn 
p r o p e r ty  and  their  o wn  labor.  A  c o m p l e te  divorce  of  p r o p e r ty  from  labor 
h as  b e en  effected  in  Great  Britain.  In  no  other  c o u n t r y,  therefore,  has  t he 
w ar  b e t w e en  the  t wo  classes  t h at  constitute  m o d e rn  society,  assumed  so 
colossal  dimensions  and  features  so  distinct  and  palpable. 

B ut  it  is  precisely  from  t h e se  facts  t h at  the  w o r k i ng  classes  of  Britain, 
b e f o re  all o t h e r s,  are  c o m p e t e nt a nd called u p on to  act  as leaders  in t he great 
m o v e m e nt  t h at  m u st  finally  result  in  the  absolute  emancipation  of  labor. 
S u ch  they  are  from  the  c o n s c i o us  clearness  of  their  position,  the  v a st  superi 
ority  of  their  n u m b e r s,  the  disastrous  struggles  of  their  p a st  and  the  moral 
strength  of  their  present. 

T he  L o n d on  daily  p a p e rs  o b s e r ve  the  "policy  of  a b s t e n t i o n"  with r e s p e ct 
to  t he  proceedings  of  t he  L a b or  Parliament.  T h ey  h o pe  to  kill  it  by  a  v a st 
"conspiration  de  silence.  "  H a v i ng  for  w h o le  m o n t hs  fatigued t he public with 
interminable  articles  on  t he  probable  c h a n c es  of  realization  for  the  s c h e me 
of  s u ch  a  Parliament,  n ow  they  purposely  avoid  e v er  mentioning  that  it  h as 
actually  sprung  into  life  and  already  b e g un  to  work.  This  w i s d om  of  t he 
ostrich,  that  imagines  it  avoids  dangers  by  feigning  n ot  to  see  t h e m,  will  n ot

After  all,  the  Russians  completed,  by  the  e nd  of  J a n u a r y,  their  con

from  115,000,  d e d u ct  t h e n,  say  20,000  or  25,000  m en  m o re  for  the  defence 
of  t he  line  from  Brailow  to  t he  sea,  and  t h e re  r e m a i n ed  for  t he  w h o le  of 
G r e a t er  Wallachia,  inclusive  of  garrisons,  from  50,000  to  65,000  men—an 
a r my  far  from  sufficient  to  defend  s u ch  a  long  line  of  attack,  a nd  a line  of 
c o m m u n i c a t i on  running parallel  with  the  line  of  attack,  at  a  s h o rt  d i s t a n ce

W i th  all  their  efforts,  t h e n,  the  Russians  could  m e r e ly  c o n c e n t r a te  before 
Kalafat  a  force  barely  sufficient  to  drive  in  t he  o u t p o s t s,  b ut  not  to  attack

t h o u g ht  not impossible.  With regard  to  this  possibility we  are  able  to  say that 
after  a  careful  investigation  of  the  d o c u m e n ts  relating to  t he  whole  affair  so 
far,  we  are  c o n v i n c ed  that  the  insurgents  w e re  f o u nd  exclusively  a m o ng  the

300,000  souls,  distributed  throughout  the  cities  of  t he  E m p i r e,  t h ey  are  so

in  driving  a w ay  all  t he  priests  of  G r e ek  origin,  a nd  in  supplying  their  places 
by  native  p a s t o r s. 

B ut  although  the  p r e s e nt  G r e ek  insurrection,  considered  w i th  reference

As  we  learn  from  t he  English  journals  and  from  notice  given  in  t he  H o u se 
of  L o r ds  by  L o rd  Shaftesbury,  a nd  in  t he  C o m m o ns  by  M r. M o n c k t on

at  least,  with  t h e se  G r e ek  m o v e m e n ts  to  t a ke  m e a s u r es  to  meliorate  t he 
condition  of  t he  Christian  subjects  of t he  P o r t e.  I n d e e d, we  are told explicitly 
t h at  t he  great  e nd  aimed  at  by  t he  w e s t e rn  P o w e rs  is  to  p ut  the  Christian 
religion  on  a  footing  of  equal  rights  with  t he  M a h o m e t an  in  T u r k e y.  N o w, 
either  this  m e a ns  nothing  at  all,  or  it  m e a ns  the  granting  political  and  civil 
rights,  b o th  to  M u s s u l m a ns  a nd  Christians,  without  any  reference  to  either 
religion,  a nd  without  considering  religion  at  all.  In  other  w o r d s,  it m e a ns  t he 
c o m p l e te  separation  of  S t a te  a nd  C h u r c h,  of  Religion  a nd  Politics.  B ut  t he 
T u r k i sh  S t a t e,  like  all  Oriental  S t a t e s,  is  f o u n d ed  u p on  the  m o st  intimate

On  the  other  h a n d,  t he  m a in  feature  that  distinguishes  the  G r e ek  con

A  m o st  important  e v e nt  is  the  c o m p u l s o ry  publication  by  Ministers  of  their 
secret  c o r r e s p o n d e n ce  with  t he  E m p e r or  of  R u s s ia  during  t he  first  t h r ee 
m o n t hs  of  their  administration,  as  also  of  t he  m e m o r a n d um  of  the  interview 
b e t w e en  t he  Czar  a nd  L o rd  A b e r d e en  in  1844,  which  t he  Journal  de  St.  Pé-
tersbourg  challenged  t he  latter  to  p r o d u c e. 

I  begin  with  an  analysis  of  the  " m e m o r a n d u m"  by  C o u nt  N e s s e l r o d e, 
delivered  to  her  M a j e s t y 's  G o v e r n m e n t,  a nd  f o u n d ed  on  c o m m u n i c a t i o ns 
from  the  E m p e r or  of  Russia,  s u b s e q u e nt  to  bis  visit to England in J u n e,  1844. 
T he  p r e s e nt  status  quo  of  t he  O t t o m an  E m p i re  is  " t he  m o st  compatible  with 
t he  general  interest  of  t he  m a i n t e n a n ce  of  p e a c e ."  England  and  R u s s ia  agree 
on  this  principle,  a nd  t h e r e f o re  unite  their  efforts  to  k e ep  up  t h at  status  quo. 
" W i th  this  object,  the  essential  point  is  to  suffer  the  P o r te  to  live  in r e p o s e, 
without  needlessly  disturbing  it  by  diplomatic  bickerings,  a nd without inter 
fering,  w i t h o ut  absolute  necessity,  in  its  internal  affairs."  N o w,  h ow  is  this 
" s y s t em  of  f o r b e a r a n c e"  to  be  successfully  carried  o u t?  Firstly,  by  G r e at 
Britain  n ot  interfering with the  interpretation R u s s ia m ay  think fit to  p ut u p on 
h er treaties  with t he  P o r t e, b ut forcing it, on the c o n t r a r y, to  act in conformity 
with  t h o se  treaties  as  interpreted  by  R u s s i a;  a n d,  in  t he  second  place,  by 
allowing  R u s s ia  " c o n s t a n t l y"  to  meddle  b e t w e en t he  Sultan a nd his  Christian 
subjects.  In  a  w o r d,  the  system  of  f o r b e a r a n ce  t o w a rd  the  Porte  m e a ns  a 
s y s t em  of  complicity  w i th  Russia.  This  strange  proposition  is,  h o w e v e r,  far 
from  being  e x p r e s s ed  in  r u de  t e r m s. 

T he  m e m o r a n d um  affects  to  speak  of  "all  the  great  P o w e r s ,"  b ut  at  t he 
s a me  time  plainly  intimates  t h at  t h e re  exist  no  g r e at  P o w e rs  at  all  besides 
R u s s ia  and  England.  F r a n c e,  it  is  said,  will  "find  herself  obliged  to  act  in

conformity  with  t he  c o u r se  agreed  u p on  b e t w e en  St. P e t e r s b u rg  a nd  L o n 
d o n ."  A u s t r ia  is  r e p r e s e n t ed  as  a  m e re  a p p e n d a ge  to  Russia,  enjoying  no 
life  of  h er  o w n,  following  no  distinct  policy,  b ut  o ne  "closely  united  by  the 
principle  of  perfect  identity"  with  t h at  of  R u s s i a.  P r u s s ia  is  t r e a t ed  as  a 
nonentity,  n ot  w o r th  mentioning,  a nd  c o n s e q u e n t ly  is  n ot  so  m u ch  as  men- 
tioned.  All  the  great  P o w e r s,  t h e n,  is  only  a  rhetorical  figure  for  t he  t wo 
Cabinets  of  St.  P e t e r s b u rg  a nd  L o n d o n;  a nd t he  line  of  c o n d u ct to  be  agreed 
u p on by  all  t he great P o w e rs  m e a ns  the line  of  c o n d u ct d r a wn up  at St.  P e t e r s 
b u rg  a nd  to  be  acted  u p on  at  L o n d o n.  T he  m e m o r a n d um  s a y s: 

" T he  P o r te  has  a  c o n s t a nt  t e n d e n cy  to  extricate  itself  from  the  en- 
g a g e m e n ts  i m p o s ed u p on it by t he treaties  which it  h as  c o n c l u d ed  with  other 
p o w e r s.  It  h o p es  to  do  so  with  impunity,  b e c a u se  it  r e c k o ns  on  the  m u t u al 
j e a l o u sy  of  t he  Cabinets.  It  thinks  t h at  if  it  fails  in  its  engagements  t o w a rd 
o ne  of  t h e m,  the  r e st  will  e s p o u se  its  quarrel,  a nd  will  s c r e en  it  from  all 
responsibility. 

It  is  essential  n ot  to  confirm  the  P o r te  in  this  delusion.  E v e ry  time  t h at 
it  fails  in its  obligations  t o w a rd  one  of  t he  great  P o w e r s,  it  is  t he  interest  of 
all  t he  r e st  to  m a ke  it  sensible  of  its  error,  and  seriously  to  e x h o rt  it  to  act 
rightly  t o w a rd  t he  Cabinet  which  d e m a n ds  j u st  reparation.

As  soon  as  the  Porte  shall  perceive  that  it  is  not  supported  by  the  other  20 

Cabinets,  it  will  give  way,  and  t he  differences  w h i ch  h a ve  a r i s en  will  be 
arranged  in  a  conciliatory  m a n n e r,  w i t h o ut  a ny  conflict  resulting  from 
t h e m ." 

This  is  the  formula  by  w h i ch  England  is  called  u p on  to  assist  R u s s ia  in 
h er  policy  of  extorting  n ew  concessions  from  T u r k e y,  on  t he  g r o u nd  of  her 
ancient  treaties.

" In  t he  p r e s e nt  state  of  feeling  in  E u r o p e,  t he  C a b i n e ts  c a n n ot  see  w i th 
indifference  the  Christian  populations  in  T u r k ey  e x p o s ed  to  flagrant  acts  of

O t t o m an  Ministers  sensible  of this  truth,  a nd to p e r s u a de t h em t h at t h ey c an

condition  t h at  t h ey  t r e at  t he  Christian  subjects  of  t he  P o r te  with  toleration 
and  w i th  mildness.

It will be  t he d u ty of the foreign r e p r e s e n t a t i v e s, guided by t h e se principles, 
to  act  a m o ng  t h e m s e l v es  in  a  perfect  spirit  of  a g r e e m e n t.  If  t h ey  a d d r e ss

T he  only  thing  w a n t e d,  it  is  said,  in  the  e v e nt  of  T u r k e y 's  fall  becoming 

is  England  and  Russia's  "coming  to  a  previous  understanding

before  having recourse  to  action. " " T h is  n o t i o n ,"  we  are  a s s u r ed  by  t he 
10  m e m o r a n d u m,  " w as  in  principle  agreed  u p on  during  the  E m p e r o r 's  last

N o w,  w h at  m e a ns 

this  eventual  engagement?  Firstly,  t h at  R u s s ia  a nd 
England  should  previously  c o me  to  a  c o m m on  understanding  as  to  t he

act  in  conformity  with  their  views.  T he  natural  result  of  s u ch  a  c o m m on

On  the  14th  of  J a n u a r y,  as  Sir  G . H.  S e y m o ur  informs  L o rd  J . R u s s e l l,  in

H a v i n g,  t h u s,  again  given  notice  of  t he  impending  d e a th  of  the  O t t o m an 
E m p i r e,  t he  s u m m o ns  to  England followed in conformity with t he  " e v e n t u al

of  a  partition. 

"I  desire  to  speak  to  y ou  as  a  friend  a nd  a  gentleman.  If  England  and  I 
arrive  at  an  understanding  of  this  matter,  as  regards  t he rest, it  m a t t e rs little

E n g l a n d, 

therefore,  will  be  forbidden

Foreign  Office,  F e b r u a ry  9,  1853. 
Sir:  I  h a ve  received,  and laid before  t he  Q u e e n,  y o ur  secret  and  confidential 
d i s p a t ch  of  the  22d  of  J a n u a r y.  H er  Majesty,  u p on  this  as  u p on  former 
o c c a s i o n s,  is  h a p py  to  acknowledge  t he  m o d e r a t i o n,  t he  f r a n k n e s s,  and  t he 
friendly  disposition  of  his  Imperial  Majesty.  H er  M a j e s ty  has  directed  me 
to  reply in t he  same  spirit  of t e m p e r a t e, candid, a nd amicable discussion. T he 
q u e s t i on raised  by  his  Imperial  Majesty  is  a v e ry  serious  o n e.  It is,  supposing 
t he  contingency  of  the  dissolution  of  t he  T u r k i sh  E m p i re  to  be  probable,  or 
e v en  imminent,  w h e t h er  it  is  not  better  to  be  p r o v i d ed  b e f o r e h a nd  for  a

u n e x p e c t e d l y,  and  before  some  ulterior  s y s t em  h as  b e en  s k e t c h e d;  this  is 
t he  point,  said  his  Imperial  Majesty,  to  w h i ch  I  am  desirous  t h at y ou  should 
call  t he  attention  of  your  G o v e r n m e n t.  In  considering  this  grave  question, 
the  first reflection  that o c c u rs  to  her  Majesty's  G o v e r n m e nt is  that  no  actual 
crisis  h as  o c c u r r ed  which r e n d e rs  n e c e s s a ry  a  solution of this  v a st E u r o p e an 
p r o b l e m.  Disputes  h a ve  arisen  respecting  t he  H o ly  P l a c e s,  b ut  t h e se  are 
without  t he  sphere  of  the internal g o v e r n m e nt of T u r k e y,  a nd c o n c e rn R u s s ia 
and  F r a n ce  r a t h er  t h an the  Sublime  P o r t e.  S o me  d i s t u r b a n ce  of  t he  relations 
b e t w e en  Austria  a nd  t he  Porte  has  b e en  c a u s ed  by  the  T u r k i sh  a t t a ck  on 
M o n t e n e g r o;  b ut  this  again  relates  r a t h er  to  dangers  affecting  the  frontier 
of  Austria,  t h an  t he  authority  a nd  safety  of  t he  Sultan;  so  that  t h e re  is  no 
sufficient  c a u se  for  intimating  to  the  Sultan  t h at  he  c a n n ot  k e ep  p e a ce  at 
h o m e,  or  p r e s e r ve  friendly  relations  with  his  neighbors.  It  o c c u rs  further to 
her  M a j e s t y 's  G o v e r n m e nt  to  r e m a rk  that  the  e v e nt  w h i ch  is  contemplated 
is  n ot  definitely  fixed  in  point  of  time.  W h en  William  III.  a nd  L o u is  X I V. 
disposed,  by  treaty,  of  the  succession  of  Charles  II.  of  Spain,  t h ey  w e re 
providing  for  an  e v e nt  which  could  n ot  be  far  off.  T he  infirmities  of  the 
sovereign  of  Spain,  and  the  certain  e nd  of  any  h u m an  life,  m a de  the  con 
tingency  in  p r o s p e ct  b o th  sure  and  near.  T he  d e a th  of  t he  Spanish  king  w as 
in  no  w ay  h a s t e n ed  by  the  treaty  of  partition.  T he  same  thing  m ay  be  said 
of  t he  provision  m a de  in  the  last  c e n t u ry  for  t he  disposal  of  T u s c a n y,  u p on 
the  d e c e a se  of  the  last  prince  of  t he  h o u se  of  Medici.  B ut  the  contingency 
of  t he  dissolution  of  t he  O t t o m an  empire  is  of  a n o t h er  kind.  It  m ay  h a p p en 
t w e n t y,  fifty,  or  a  h u n d r ed  y e a rs  h e n c e.  In  these  circumstances  it  would 
hardly  be  consistent  with 
the  friendly  feelings  toward  the  Sultan  which 
animate  the  Emperor  of Russia,  no  less  than  the  Queen  of  Great Britain,  to

a  case  t e n ds  v e ry  surely  to  h a s t en  t he  contingency  for  which  it  is  intended

of  the  transaction,  nor  would  s u ch  c o n c e a l m e nt  be  consistent  with  the  e nd

conviction  that  t h ey  m u st  ultimately  t r i u m p h;  while  the  Sultan's generals  and 
t r o o ps  would feel t h at no immediate  s u c c e ss could save their c a u se from final

w h i ch  is  n ow  feared,  and  t he  foresight  of  t he  friends  of  t he  patient  would 
p r o ve  the  c a u se  of  his  d e a t h.  H er  M a j e s t y 's  G o v e r n m e nt  n e ed  scarcely

cherished  ambition  of  his  o wn  nation  and  the  jealousies  of  E u r o p e.  T he

W as  this  n ot  "intimating" to  the  Sultan,  on  t he  p a rt  of  England,  in  plain 
w o r d s:  " t h at  he  c a n n ot  k e ep  p e a ce  at  h o me  or  p r e s e r ve  friendly  relations

t h at  he  would  not  allow England  to  establish  herself  at  Constantinople,  b ut 
that  he  on  his  part,  intended  to  establish  himself  t h e r e,  if  n ot  as  proprietor, 
at  least  as  depositary.  H ow  d o es  L o rd  J o hn  reply  to  this  impertinent  an

N ot  " c o n t e n t"  with  installing  the  Czar  as  t he  eventual  depositary  of 
Constantinople,  L o rd  J o hn  Russell  declares  in  the  n a me  of  t he  English 
25  G o v e r n m e nt  that  " t h ey  will  enter  into  no  a g r e e m e nt  to  provide  for  t he 
contingency  of  t he  fall  of  T u r k ey  without  previous  c o m m u n i c a t i on  to  R u s 
sia."  T h at  is  to  say,  although  the  Czar  told  Sir  H.  S e y m o ur  that  he  had  entered 
into  an  agreement  with  Austria  b e f o re  making  a ny  previous  c o m m u n i c a t i on 
to  England,  she  on  her  p a rt  pledges  herself  to  c o m m u n i c a te  with  R u s s ia 
previously  to  entering  into  an  a g r e e m e nt  with  F r a n c e.

tians  in  the  O t t o m an  E m p i r e.  T he  Czar,  far  from  disguising  his  p r e t e n t i o n s, 
told  Sir  Hamilton  plainly  that  " by  t r e a ty  he  h as  a  right  to  w a t ch  over  t h o se

" It  c an  hardly  be  o t h e r w i se  b ut t h at t he  Sovereign w ho  insists  with  such

Supposing  my  suspicion  to  be  well  f o u n d e d,  the  Emperor's  object  is  to 
engage  Her  Majesty's  Government,  in  conjunction  with  his  own  Cabinet and

p r e s s i on  p r o d u c ed  on  the  mind  of  this  whining  lover  of  T u r k ey  by  the

C z a r 's  t r e a c h e r o us  design  to  partition T u r k ey  to  the  exclusion  of  F r a n c e,  he 
tells  C o u nt  Walewski,  the  F r e n ch  E m b a s s a d or  at  L o n d o n,  that  " t h e y ,"  in 
contradistinction to  F r a n c e,  " w e re  disposed  to  place  reliance in t he E m p e r or 
of  Russia"—  t h at  "a  policy  of  suspicion  w as  neither  wise  n or  safe"—and  t h at 
"although  he  h o p ed  the  G o v e r n m e n ts  of  England  and  F r a n ce  w o u ld  always 
act  together,  when  their  policy  and  their  interests  w e re  identical,  yet  he  m u st

J o h n 's  secret  and  confidential  dispatch  of  the  9th  of  F e b r u a r y.  T he  declara

f a c t o r y;  he  " c o u ld  only  desire  t h at  t h ey  should  be  a  little  amplified."  He

25 

" t h at  it  might  be  brought  about  at  any  m o m e n t,  either  by  an  external  w a r,

He  d o es  n ot  allow  the  opportunity  to  slip  w i t h o ut  bringing  forth  his 
w o r n - o ut  b r a v a d o,  that  "if  he  h ad  n ot  stopped  t he  victorious  progress  of

He  insists  on  his  not  requiring  a  system  altogether  arranged  b e t w e en 
E n g l a nd  and  Russia,  as  to  t he  previous  disposal  of  t he  p r o v i n c es  ruled  by

" w h at  would  be  c o n t r a ry  to  English  interests,  w h at  w o u ld  be  contrary  to 
Russian  interests,  in  order  that,  t he  c a se  occurring,  t h ey  might  avoid  acting 
in  opposition  to  e a ch  o t h e r ." 

By  such  a  negative  understanding  the  C z ar  would  obtain  all  he  cares  for: 
1st,  t he  breaking  up  of  t he  O t t o m an  E m p i re  settled  b e t w e en  E n g l a nd  and 
R u s s ia  as  a  fait  accompli,  although  in  a  negative  and  conditional  form,  while 
it  w o u ld  rest  with  h im  so  to  embroil  m a t t e rs  as  to  be  able  to  declare  to 
E n g l a n d,  with  some  show  of  r e a s o n,  that  t he  contingency  f o r e s e en  had 
arrived.  Secondly,  a  secret  plan  of  action b e t w e en  E n g l a nd  and Russia, h o w-
e v er vague  and  negative, b r o u g ht  about b e h i nd the  b a ck and  to the exclusion 
of  F r a n c e,  and  thus  necessarily  setting  E n g l a nd  and  F r a n ce  by  the  ears. 
Thirdly,  England  being  restrained  by  her  negative  pledges  as  to  w h at  she 
w o u ld  not d o,  he  would  h a ve  liberty  to  elaborate  v e ry tranquilly his  o wn plan 
of  positive  action.  B e s i d e s,  it  is  evident  t h at  t wo  parties  agreeing as  to w h at 
they  will  nor  allow  e a ch  other  to  d o,  in  a  given  c a s e,  are  only  settling  in  an 
e v a s i ve  w ay  w h at  t h ey  will.  T h is  negative  sort  of  understanding  gives  only 
t he  greater  facilites  to  t he  m o re  cunning  of  t he  t wo  parties. 

" P e r h a ps  your  M a j e s t y ,"  perplexed  Sir  H a m i l t on  m u t t e r e d,  " w o u ld  be 
good  enough  to  explain  your  o wn  ideas  u p on  this  negative policy."  T he  Czar, 
after  some  show  of  c oy  r e s i s t a n c e,  feigns  to  yield  u n d er  the  gentle  p r e s s u re 
and  m a de  the  following  highly  r e m a r k a b le  declaration: 

"I  will  not  tolerate  the  permanent  o c c u p a t i on  of  Constantinople  by  the 
R u s s i a n s;  having  said  this,  I  will  say  t h at  it n e v er  shall be held by the English, 
or  F r e n c h,  or  any  other  great  nation.  Again,  I  never  will  permit  an  a t t e m pt 
at  t he  r e c o n s t r u c t i on  of  a  Byzantine  e m p i r e,  or  s u ch an  extension of  G r e e ce 
as  w o u ld  r e n d er  her  a  powerful  S t a t e;  still  less  will  I  p e r m it the  breaking up 
of  T u r k ey  into  little  republics,  asylums  for  t he  K o s s u t hs  and  Mazzinis  and 
other  revolutionists  of  E u r o p e;  r a t h er  t h an  submit  to  a ny  of  t h e se  arrange 
ments  I  would  go  to  war,  a nd  as  long  as  I  h a ve  a  m an  a nd  a m u s k et left would 
c a r ry  it  o n ." 

No  B y z a n t i ne  empire,  no  powerful  e x t e n s i on  of  G r e e c e,  no  confederation 
of  little  republics—nothing  of  t he  sort.  W h a t,  t h e n,  d o es  he  w a n t?  T h e re  w as 
no  n e ed  for  t he  British  E m b a s s a d or  to  g u e s s.  T he  E m p e r or  himself,  in  the 
c o u r se  of  t he  dialogue,  b u r s ts  u p on  his  interlocutor with t he following p r o p o-
sition: 

" T he  Principalities  are  in  fact  an  i n d e p e n d e nt  S t a te  u n d er  my  p r o t e c t i o n; 
this  might  so  continue.  Servia  might  receive  t he  s a me  form  of  g o v e r n m e n t. 
So  again w i th Bulgaria.  T h e re  seems  to be no r e a s on w hy this province  should 
n ot  form  an  i n d e p e n d e nt  state.  As  to  E g y p t,  I  quite  u n d e r s t a nd  t he  im-
p o r t a n ce  to  England  of t h at territory.  I  can t h en only  say,  that if, in the e v e nt

To  convince  the  Chancellor  of  the  conscientious  m a n n er  in w h i ch t he British

of  t he  language held by  an  English  Minister  against t he  F r e n ch  G o v e r n m e n t ."

T he  R u s s i an  m e m o r a n d um  in  answer  to  L o rd  J o h n 's  dispatch is  described

issued,  not  from  the  Russian  Chancellery,  b ut  from  the  E m p e r o r 's  secret 
C a b i n e t ."  So  it  is.  But  it  is  superfluous  to  dwell  on  it,  as  it  merely  r e s u m es 
the  views  of  the  Czar  as  developed  in  his  d i a l o g u e ."  It  i m p r e s s es  u p on  the 
British  G o v e r n m e nt  t h at  " t he  result,  w h a t e v er  it  might  b e,  of  t h e se  c o m

a n o t h er  line  of  c o n d u c t,  t h us  compelling  R u s s ia  a nd  A u s t r ia  to  act  in  their

identified.  O ne  of  t he  c a u s es  which  might  lead  to  the  immediate  downfall 
of  T u r k e y,  is  expressly  stated  to  be  t he  Question  of  the  Holy  Shrines,  and 
" t he  religious  sentiments  of  t he  o r t h o d ox  G r e e ks  offended  by  the  con 
cessions  m a de  to  the  L a t i n s ."  At  the  close  of  t he  m e m o r a n d um  " no  less 
p r e c i o u s"  t h an  t he  a s s u r a n c es  contained  in  Russell's  dispatch,  are  declared 
to  be  " t he  proofs  of  friendship  and personal  confidence  on  the  part  of Her 
Majesty  the  Queen,  which  Sir  H a m i l t on  S e y m o ur  h ad  b e en  directed  on this

If  the  Czar  had  c o m m u n i c a t ed  to  F r a n ce  also  that  " t he  sick  m an  w as

"I  might  v e n t u re  to  suggest  t h at  some  expression  might  be  used  in  the

Declaration  of  W a r-
On  the  History  of  the  Eastern  Question 

F r om  Our  O wn  C o r r e s p o n d e n t. 

New-York  Daily Tribune. 
Nr. 4054, 15. April, 1854 

L o n d o n,  T u e s d a y,  M a r ch  28,  1854. 

W ar  has  at  length  b e en  declared.  T he  Royal  M e s s a ge  w as  read  y e s t e r d ay  in 
b o th  H o u s es  of  Parliament;  by  L o rd  A b e r d e en  in  t he  L o r d s,  a nd  by  L o rd 
J.  Russell  in  the  C o m m o n s.  It  describes  the  m e a s u r es  a b o ut  to  be  t a k en  as 
" a c t i ve  steps  to  o p p o se t he  e n c r o a c h m e n ts  of Russia u p on T u r k e y. " T o - m o r 
r ow  The  London  Gazette  will  publish  the  official  notification  of  w a r,  and 
on  Friday  the  address  in  reply to  t he  message  will  b e c o me  the  subject  of  t he 
Parliamentary  d e b a t e s. 

Simultaneously  with  the  English  declaration,  L o u is  N a p o l e on  has  c o m 

m u n i c a t ed  a  similar  message  to  his  S e n a te  a nd  Corps  Législatif. 

T he  declaration  of  war  against  Russia  could  no  longer  be  delayed,  after 
Captain  Blackwood,  the  bearer  of  t he  Anglo-French  ultimatissimum  to  t he 
C z a r,  had  returned,  on  Saturday last,  with  the  a n s w er  t h at  Russia would give 
to  that  p a p er  no  a n s w er  all.  T he  mission  of  Capt.  B l a c k w o o d,  h o w e v e r,  has 
n ot  b e en  altogether  a  gratuitous  o n e.  It  has  afforded  to  Russia  the  m o n th  of 
M a r c h,  t h at  most  dangerous  e p o ch  of  the  year,  to  Russian  arms. 

T he  publication  of  the  secret  c o r r e s p o n d e n ce  b e t w e en  t he  Czar  and  the 
English  G o v e r n m e n t,  instead  of  provoking  a  b u r st  of  public  indignation 
against  t he  latter,  has—incredibile  dictu—been  t he  signal  for  the  p r e s s,  b o th 
weekly  a nd  daily,  for  congratulating  England  on  t he  p o s s e s s i on  of  so  truly 
national  a  Ministry.  I  understand,  h o w e v e r,  t h at  a  meeting  will  be  called 
together  for  t he  p u r p o se  of  opening  the  e y es  of  a blinded  British  public  on 
the  real  c o n d u ct  of  the  G o v e r n m e n t.  It  is  to  be  held  on T h u r s d ay  n e xt in the 
Music  Hall,  Store-st.;  and  L o rd  P o n s o n b y,  Mr.  L a y a r d,  Mr.  U r q u h a r t,  etc., 
are  e x p e c t ed  to  take  p a rt  in  the  proceedings. 

T he  Hamburger  Correspondent h as  t he  following: 
" A c c o r d i ng to  advices from  St. Petersburg,  w h i ch  arrived  h e re  on the  16th 
inst.,  t he  Russian  G o v e r n m e nt  p r o p o s es  to  publish  various  other  d o c u m e n ts

on  the  E a s t e rn  question.  A m o ng  the  d o c u m e n ts  destined  for  publication  are 
some  letters  written  by  Prince  A l b e r t ." 

It  is  a  curious  fact  that  the  same  evening  on  w h i ch  the  royal  m e s s a ge  w as 
delivered  in  t he  C o m m o n s,  t he  G o v e r n m e nt  suffered  their  first  defeat in  t he 
p r e s e nt  session;  t he  second reading of  the  P o or  Settlement and R e m o v al bill 
having,  notwithstanding  t he  efforts  of  t he  G o v e r n m e n t,  b e en  adjourned  to 
the  28th  of  April,  by  a  division  of  209  to  183.  T he  p e r s on  to  w h om  t he 
G o v e r n m e nt  is  indebted  for  this  defeat, is no  other t h an  my L o rd Palmerston. 
" H is  l o r d s h i p ,"  says  The  Times  of  this  d a y,  " h as  managed  to  p ut  himself 
a nd  his  colleagues b e t w e en t wo fires  (the Tories  and t he Irish party)  without 
m u ch  p r o s p e ct  of  leaving  t h em  to  settle  it  b e t w e en  t h e m s e l v e s ." 

We  are  informed  t h at  on  t he  12th  i n s t,  a  t r e a ty  of  triple-alliance  w as 
signed  b e t w e en  F r a n c e,  E n g l a nd  a nd  T u r k e y,  b ut  that,  notwithstanding  t he 
personal  application  of  the  Sultan  to  the  G r a nd  Mufti,  the  latter  supported 
by  t he  corps of t he  U l e m a s,  refused to  issue  his ferva sanctioning the  stipula 
tion  a b o ut  t he  changes  in  the  situation  of  t he  Christians  in  T u r k e y,  as  being 
in  contradiction  with  the  p r e c e p ts  of  t he  K o r a n.  This  intelligence  must  be 
l o o k ed  u p on  as  being  the  m o re  important,  as  it  c a u s ed  L o rd  D e r by  to  m a ke 
t he  following  observation: 

"I  will  only  e x p r e ss  my  e a r n e st  anxiety  t h at  t he  G o v e r n m e nt  will  state 
w h e t h er  t h e re  is  any  t r u th  in  t he  r e p o rt  t h at  h as  b e en  circulated  during  t he

25  Russia,  we  h a ve  p r o t e s t ed  against." 

The  Times  of  to-day,  while  declaring  t h at  t he  policy  of  the  G o v e r n m e nt 
is  directly  o p p o s ed  to  t h at  of  L o rd  D e r by  a d d s:  " We  should  deeply  regret

"If  a  t o w n ,"  says  the  M u s s u l m an  legislation,  " s u r r e n d e rs  by capitulation,

Constantinople  having  surrendered  by  capitulation,  as  in  like  m a n n er  has 
t he  greater  portion  of  E u r o p e an  T u r k e y,  the  Christians  t h e re  enjoy  t he 
privilege  of  living  as  rayahs,  u n d er  the  T u r k i sh  G o v e r n m e n t.  This  privilege 
t h ey  h a ve  exclusively  by  virtue  of  their  agreeing  to  a c c e pt  t he  M u s s u l m an 
protection.  It  is,  therefore,  owing  to  this  c i r c u m s t a n ce  alone, t h at t he  Chris 
tians  submit  to  be g o v e r n ed by the  M u s s u l m a ns  according to  M u s s u l m an law, 
t h at  the  patriarch  of  Constantinople,  their  spiritual  chief,  is  at t he  same  time 
their  political  representative  and  their  Chief  Justice.  W h e r e v e r,  in  t he  O t t o- 
m an  E m p i r e,  we  find  an  agglomeration  of  G r e ek  rayahs,  the  A r c h b i s h o ps 
a nd  B i s h o ps  are  by  law  m e m b e rs  of  t he  Municipal  Councils,  and,  u n d er  the 
direction  of  the  patriarch,  [watch]  over  the  repartition  of  the  t a x es  imposed 
u p on  t he  G r e e k s.  T he  patriarch  is  responsible  to  t he  P o r te  as  to  the  c o n d u ct 
of  his  co-religionists.  I n v e s t ed  with  t he  right  of  judging  the  r a y a hs  of  his 
C h u r c h,  he  delegates  this  right to  the  metropolitans  and  b i s h o p s,  in t he limits 
of  their  d i o c e s e s,  their  sentences  being obligatory for  the  executive  officers, 
k a d i s,  etc.,  of  t he  Porte  to  c a r ry  out.  T he  p u n i s h m e n ts  which  t h ey  h a ve  t he 
right  to  p r o n o u n ce  are  fines,  imprisonment,  t he  b a s t i n a d e,  and  exile.  B e

in  all  acts  of their  ministry,  s u ch as  b a p t i s m s,  marriages,  divorces,  and  testa

It  is  evident  from  this  exposé  that  this  fabric  of  t h e o c r a cy  over  t he  G r e ek 
5  Christians  of  T u r k e y,  a nd  the  whole  structure  of  their  society,  has  its  k e y 
stone  in  the  subjection  of  the  r a y ah  u n d er  the  K o r a n,  w h i c h,  in its  turn,  by 
treating  t h em  as  infidels—i.e.,  as  a nation only in areligious  sense—sanctioned 
the  combined  spiritual  and  temporal  p o w er  of  their  priests.  Then,  if  you 
abolish  their  subjection  u n d er  t he  K o r an  by  a  civil  emancipation,  y ou  cancel 
at  t he  same  time  their  subjection  to  t he  clergy,  and  p r o v o ke  a  revolution  in 
their  social,  political  a nd  religious  relations,  which,  in  the first instance,  must 
inevitably  h a nd  t h em  over  to  Russia,  If  y ou  supplant  the  K o r an  by  a  code 
civil,  you  m u st  occidentalize  t he  entire  structure  of  B y z a n t i ne  society.

Having  described  t he  relations  b e t w e en  t he  M u s s u l m an  a nd  his  Christian 
subject,  the  question  arises,  w h at  a re  t he  relations  b e t w e en  the  M u s s u l m an 
a nd  t he  unbelieving  foreigner?

As  the  K o r an treats  all  foreigners  as  f o e s,  n o b o dy will d a re to p r e s e nt him 
self  in  a  M u s s u l m an  c o u n t ry  without  having  t a k en his  precautions.  T he  first 
E u r o p e an  m e r c h a n t s,  therefore,  w ho  risked  the  c h a n c es  of  c o m m e r ce  w i th

privileges  originally  p e r s o n a l,  b ut  afterward  e x t e n d ed  to  their w h o le  nation. 
H e n ce  the  origin  of capitulations.  Capitulations  are imperial diplomas, letters 
of  privilege,  o c t r o y ed  by the  P o r te to  different E u r o p e an nations,  and  author 
izing their  subjects  to  freely e n t er  M o h a m m e d an  countries,  and  t h e re  to pur-
sue in tranquillity their affairs, a nd to practice their w o r s h i p. T h ey differ from

It  m u s t,  besides,  be  stated,  that  o ne  half  of  their  guns  is  generally  directed

T he  first,  or  o u t er  line,  e m b r a c es  in  a  semi-circle  t he  m o u th  of  the  Great

a  mile  in  width.  T he  right,  or  n o r t h e r n,  wing of  the  position  is  formed  by  the 
Peter Fort,  an insignificant lunette  on  t he  island,  a b o ut  1400  y a r ds  from  t he 
d e ep  w a t er  c h a n n e l;  a  mortar  battery,  also  on  t he  island,  half  a  mile  to  t he 
east,  and  which  m ay  be  considered  as  almost  useless,  a nd  the  Fort  Con-
stantine,  a  strong  lunette  closed  to  the  rear,  built  on  t he  s a n d s,  ||4|  within 
1000  y a r ds  from t he edge of  d e ep w a t e r, exactly in front of the  m o r t ar battery. 
This  f o rt is  of  m o d e rn construction  and  carries  50 g u ns  in t wo  tiers.  It  serves 
to  defend  t he outer  a p p r o a c h e s,  a nd m ay b e c o me t r o u b l e s o me to  a f l e et while 
forming;  b ut  if  o n ce  p a s s e d,  o ne  half of  its  guns  b e c o me  useless.  T he  centre 
of  t he  first  line  is  m a de  up  by  t he  Fort Alexander (not  t he  o ne  on t he  n o r th

a nd  small  as  it  looks  on  plans  and  c h a r t s,  it  carries  no  less  t h an  seventy-two

ventilated  c a s e m a t es  so  as  to  d r aw  off  t he  s m o k e,  this  tower-like  fort  will 
give  e n o u gh  to  do  to  a  couple  of  t h r e e - d e c k e r s.  Behind  it lies  the  old  Citadel, 
a  lunette  the  insignificance  of  w h i ch  is  p r o v ed  by  t he  v e ry  existence  of  t he 
n ew  fort,  w h i ch  intercepts  the  fire  of o ne  half  of  its  guns.—The  left or  south 
e rn  wing,  finally,  is  f o r m ed  by  t he  Risbank Fort  and  Battery,  situated  s o u th 
of  the  e n t r a n ce  to  the  G r e at  R o a d.  This  fort,  c o n s t r u c t ed  in  the  last  c e n t u r y,

guns  are  disposed  in  t wo  tiers  a nd  their  total  n u m b er  is  increased  to  fifty. 
B ut  for  all  that  it  occupies  a  far  larger  a r ea  t h an  the  m o d e rn  forts,  offering 
a  frontage  t o w a r ds  the  r o a ds  of  s o me  300  y a r d s,  w h i ch  frontage,  b e s i d e s, 
is  enfiladed,  partially  from  t he  d e ep  w a t er  c h a n n e l,  and  entirely by  a position

half  a  mile  w e s t w a r d s.  To  obviate  this,  t he  Risbank  Battery  has  b e en  built 
600  y a r ds  to  the  rear,  b ut  in  a  position  little  a d a p t ed  for  that  p u r p o s e.  T he 
R i s b a nk  F o rt  lies  exactly  a  mile  s o u th  from  Fort  Alexander,  a nd  b o th  s w e ep

T he  second  line  p r o t e c ts  the  w h o le  of the  G r e at R o ad  along with the  e n t r a n ce 
to  t he  Little  Road.  It  consists  of  t he  t wo  flanking  w o r ks  of  Fort  Peter  the 
First  (old,  badly  c o n s t r u c t e d,  a  sort  of  c r o w n - w o rk  situated  half  a  mile  E a st 
of t he  Alexander  Fort,  and  carrying  on  a frontage  of 250  y a r ds  only  24 guns),

w e s t e rn  wall  of  t he  Merchant\\S\  Harbour'm t he  c e n t r e.  This  wall,  projecting 
from  the  island  of  K r o n s t a dt itself,  c o m es  d o wn  to  the  v e ry  edge  of  the  d e ep 
c h a n n el  with  w h i ch  it  forms  a  right  angle,  a nd  w h i ch  is  h e re  b ut  300  y a r ds

placed  as  to  h a ve  little  effect  u p on  t he  shipping  and  offers,  in  conjunction 
w i th  b o th  t he  main  fronts  of  Peter  I  F o rt  a nd  t wo  fronts  of  Kronslot,  a m o st 
effective  c r o ss  fire  over  the  inner  half  of  t he  G r e at  R o a d,  w h e re  from  t he 
obstacles  created  by  t he  fire  of  the  first  line,  a nd  t he  n a r r o w n e ss  of  t he 
channel,  it  must  be  extremely  difficult  for  a ny  ships  b ut  screw-steamers  to 
t a ke  up  a  good  position  in  sufficient  f o r c e.

T he  third  line,  the  direct  d e f e n ce  of  the  Little  or  inner  R o a d,  is  f o r m e d, 
on  t he  south  side  of t he  channel, by a third (the  N o r th E a s t) front of  Kronslot, 
and  on the  n o r th  a nd  e a st  side  by  the  fortified  walls  of the M e r c h a n t, Middle,

e a s t e rn e nd  of t he  Middle  H a r b o u r,  r a k es  t he  w h o le  of t he Little R o a d, while 
t he S o u th Wall of t he M e r c h a nt and Middle H a r b o u rs p r o t e ct it by a front fire. 
B o th  walls  are  flanked  by  several  bastions,  fortified  gates  and  o t h er  p r o 
j e c t i o n s.  T he  width  of  t he  d e ep  w a t er  channel,  h e r e,  being  n o w h e re  greater

d o u b t ed  t h at  before  ships  could  p e n e t r a te  so  far,  K r o n s t a dt  would  h a ve  to 
capitulate.  T he  central  w o rk  of  this  third  line,  a nd  t he  only  o ne  w h i ch  m ay 
e v er  h a ve  a ny  practical  utility,  is  Fort  Menchikoff,  t he  first  bastion,  from 
t he  w e s t,  on  the  M e r c h a nt  H a r b o ur  S o u th  wall.  This  b a s t i on  h as  b e en

t he  Little  a nd  G r e at  r o a d s,  the  other  half  appearing,  from  t he  direction  of 
their  e m b r a s u r e s,  almost  useless.  W h e t h er  the  four  tiers  of  g u ns  will  not 
p r o ve  too  h e a vy  for  t he  n a r r ow  foundation  of  t he  building,  r e m a i ns  to  be

We  m ay  a d d,  t h at  on  the  land-side  K r o n s t a dt  is  fortified  by  regularly 
b a s t i o n ed  fronts,  requiring  a  siege  in  d ue  form  to  be  f o r c e d;  a nd  s u ch  a  siege 
in  the  s w a m py  ground  of  the  little  island,  with  o n ly  a  fleet  for  b a se  of

be  d o ne  from  the  sea. 

It  is  u n d e r s t o od  that  we  could  only  describe  t he  p e r m a n e nt  fortifications 
s u ch  as  t h ey  existed  according  to  t he  latest  s u r v e ys  a nd  military  r e p o r t s. 
T h e re  m ay  h a ve  b e en  some  alterations  during  the  last few  y e a r s,  b ut  it is  n ot 
p r o b a b le  t h at  t h ey  h a ve  b e en  v e ry  important. 

To  recapitulate.  T he  fate  of  any  attack  against  K r o n s t a dt  m u st  be  d e- 
cided  ||6|  in t he  G r e at R o a d,  and  h e re  t he  only fortifications  t h at  c an effectu

t wo  fronts  of  Kronslot,  the  w e s t e rn  H a r b o ur  Wall,  a nd  F o rt  Menchikoff. 
Altogether  t h ey  m ay  bring  350  guns  at  o n ce  to  b e ar  u p on  t he  attack,  m o st 
of  t h em  well  p r o t e c t ed  by  walls  and  vaults,  and  firing  t h r o u gh  n a r r ow

q u e s t i on  is:  C an  a  sufficient  naval  force  be  b r o u g ht  up  this  n a r r ow  and 
intricate  channel,  to  face  b o th  t he  n o r t h e rn  a nd  s o u t h e rn  fronts  of  defence 
a nd  to  silence  their  fire,  while  that  force  is  itself  e x p o s ed  to  a  raking  fire

British  Finances—The Troubles  at  Preston 

p o u n d.  If  a n y b o dy  should  tell  me  t h at  t he  o v e r s c r u p u l o us  Chancellor  of

At  the  s a me  time  that  the  Duns  Scotus  of  the  [Coalition,]  the  D o c t or

This  financial  policy  of  the  Coalition  perfectly  [takes  up]  with their  diplo

n u n n e r i e s.  T he  principal  plea  on  which  Mr. C h a m b e r s 's  motion  intends  to 
be  b a s ed  is  t he  seclusion  of  girls  forcibly  held  from  their  natural  and  legiti 
m a te  p r o t e c t o r s.  T he  middle  classes  of  England  s h u d d er  at  the  probability 
of  girls  being  kidnapped  for  n u n n e r i e s,  b ut  their  justice,  s h o wn  in  a  r e c e nt 
c a s e,  b e c o m es  impotent  w h en  girls  are  k i d n a p p ed  for  satisfying  t he  lust  of 
aristocrats  or  caprice  of  cotton  lords.  L a st  w e ek  a  girl  of  sixteen  had  b e en

t h e re  night  a nd  day,  m a de  to  sleep  t h e r e,  and  take  her  meals  t h e r e,  locked 
up  as  in  a  prison.  W h en  her  father  discovered  w h at  h ad b e c o me  of  his  child, 
he  w as  n ot  allowed  to  see  her,  but  w as  driven  a w ay  from  t he factory by t he 
police.  In  this  c a se  t he  F a c t o ry  law w as  violated,  t he  law  of  p e r s o n al liberty, 
t he  law  that gives  the  father  the  c u s t o dy  of  his  child  u n d er  age,  the  v e ry right 
of  habeas  corpus  w as  set  at  nought.  A  gross  and  flagrant  c a se  of  abduction 
h ad  b e en  committed.  B ut  h ow  did  the  Magistrates  act  in this  c a s e,  w h en the 
disconsolate  father  appealed  to  t h em  for  r e d r e s s?  Their a n s w er  w a s:  " T h ey

In  1847  the  P r e s t on  c o t t on  lords  r e d u c ed  w a g es  on  a  solemn  promise  to

of  prosperity,  t h ey  refused  to  k e ep  their w o r d. T he w o r k i ng m en of four mills 
struck,  and  w e re  supported  by  t he  contributions  of  the  remaining  at  work.

entered  e a ch  into  a  £5,000  b o nd  to  enforce  their  conspiracy.  T he  operatives 
t h en  appealed  for  support  to  the  o t h er  t o w ns  of  L a n c a s h i r e,  and that support 
w as  given.  T he  employers  h ad  sent  emissaries  to  p e r s u a de  and  incite  t he 
cotton  lords  of  other  t o w ns  to  l o ck  o ut  their  h a n d s,  and  succeeded  in  their

t h em  to  counterbalance  the  [subscriptions]  of  t he  operatives.  W h en  t h ey 
found  t h at  all  t h e se  efforts  w e re  of  no  avail,  t h ey  sent  their  agents  far  a nd 
near  to  induce  laborers  and  their  families,  n e e d l e w o m e n,  and  p a u p e rs  from 
t he  w o r k h o u s es  of  England  a nd  Ir[eland  to  c o m e]  to  P r e s t o n.  Finding  t he 
surplus  did  n ot  flow  in  fast  e n o u gh  for  their  w i s h e s,  t h ey  tried  to  p r o v o ke 
t he  people  to  a b r e a ch  of  t he p e a c e.  T h ey  aggravated t h em by their insolence. 
T h ey  forbade  meetings  in  the  M a r s h,  [but]  t he  people  held  meetings  in 
Blackstone  Edge  a nd  other  interdicted  localities.  T h ey  introduced  o ne  hun

t h ey  w e re  defeated  in  e a ch  of  their  a t t e m p t s.  Notwithstanding  t h e se  facts, 
an  indictment  of  conspiracy  is  charged,  n ot  against  t he  m a s t e r s,  b ut  against

published  a  placard  to  the  effect  t h at  t h ey  h ad  gone  to  w o rk  on  condition 
of  p a y m e nt  at  a certain rate.  T he  m a s t e r s' c o m m i t t ee t h r e a t e n ed proceedings

to  support  t he  m a s t e r s'  strike.  T he  mill-owner  t h e r e u p on  said  something 
w h i c h,  being  a  flat  contradiction  of  m e n 's  s t a t e m e n t,  occasioned  t h em  all  to 
w i t h d r a w.  If  [ t he  m a k i n g]  of  this  b o nd  of  £5,000  w as  a  conspiracy  in  t he

b ut  t he  choice  of  m e a ns  b e c o m es  m o re  limited.  A c c u r a cy  of  fact  must  be 
m o re  strictly  adhered  t o;  a  m o re  sedate  a nd businesslike  diction is  a d o p t e d; 
a nd  in  spite  of  attempts  at  distortion  which  generally b e t r ay t h e m s e l v es  soon 
enough,  t h e re  r e m a i ns  at  least  e n o u gh  of  positive  information  to  m a ke  s u ch 
a b o ok in  m a ny  c a s es  an  important  historical  d o c u m e n t.  If,  b e s i d e s,  it  should 
h a p p en  to  h a ve  b e en  written  by  a  m an  in  a  relatively  i n d e p e n d e nt  position, 
it  m ay  e v en  be  excellent  as  a  military  history,  a nd  this  is  actually  t he  c a se 
w i th  Smitt's  H i s t o ry  of  the  Polish  W a r. 

T he  composition  and  organisation  of  t he  R u s s i an  a r my  is  k n o wn  well 
e n o u gh  to  military  m en  all  over  E u r o p e.  T he  e x t r e me  simplicity  of  this 
organisation,  as  far  at least  as  the  " a r my  of  o p e r a t i o n"  is  c o n c e r n e d,  m a k es 
it  e a sy  to  u n d e r s t a nd  it.  T he  actual  difficulty  is  merely  to  k n ow  h ow far  this 
organisation  h as  b e en  really  carried  out,  h ow  m u ch  of  this  a r my  exists  not 
merely  on  p a p er  b ut  c an  be  b r o u g ht  forward  against  a  foreign  foe.  It  is  on 
this  point  t h at  t h e se  Russian  military  writings  in  w e s t e rn  languages  are 
principally  important.  National  pride  p r e v e n ts  their  a u t h o r s,  w h e r e v er  t he 
e n e my  has  b e en  partially  successful  and  offered  a  lively  r e s i s t a n c e,  from 
overrating  t he  n u m b e rs  of  c o m b a t a n ts  on t he  R u s s i an  side.  In order  to  guard 
t he  h o n o ur  of  the  Russian  a r m s,  t h ey  m u st  unveil  t he  differences  b e t w e en 
t he  real  and  nominal  strength  of  Russian  armies.  Smitt's  w o r k,  w h i ch  gives 
the  official  muster-rolls,  is  particularly  useful  for  this  p u r p o s e.  Tolstoi's 
H u n g a r i an  campaign,  on  the  contrary,  quite in h a r m o ny with t he  proceedings 
of  t he  R u s s i a ns  in  that  c o u n t r y,  a p p e a rs  to  be  i n t e n d ed  to  show  off  not  so 
m u ch  t he  valour  as t he formidable  and overwhelming n u m b e rs  of t he Russian 
a r m i e s,  r e a dy  to  be  launched  u p on  the  revolutionary  w e s t. 

B ut  if  we  c an  arrive  at  something like  certainty regarding t h at p a rt at least 
of  t he  R u s s i an  army  w h i ch  m o re  directly  m e n a c es  t he  r e st  of E u r o p e, it is far 
m o re  difficult  to  ascertain  t he  real  state  of  the  fleet.  We  shall,  later  on, 
collect  w h a t e v er  information  we  h a ve  m et  with,  b ut  m u st  wait for  something 
m o re  definite  until  " C h a r l e y"  gives  a  better  a c c o u nt  of  it,  or  s e n ds  a  few 
specimens  over  for  home-inspection. 

T he  f  ortif  icatory  system,  the  preliminary  p r e p a r a t i on  of  the  theatre  of  w ar 
for  defence  and  attack,  is  of  c o u r se  v e ry  difficult  of  a c c e ss  in  a c o u n t ry  like 
Russia.  T he  coast  defences  are  to  a  certain  degree  delineated  in  c h a r ts  a nd 
p l a n s,  a nd  cannot,  from  their  very  n a t u r e,  be  k e pt  entirely hidden.  K r o n s t a dt 
a nd  S e b a s t o p o l,  although  m a ny  details  of  military  i m p o r t a n ce  are  n ot  well 
k n o w n,  are  yet  n ot  half  as  mysterious  places  as  t h ey  a p p e ar  to  s o me  parties.

T he  peculiar  c i r c u m s t a n c es  in  w h i ch  R u s s ia  is  placed  require  a  military

of  t he  R u s s i an  a r m y. 

This  organisation  of  t he  R u s s i an  a r m y,  t he  origin  of  w h i ch  m ay  be  traced

T he  G r e at  A r my  of  O p e r a t i o n,  w h i ch  is  almost  exclusively  stationed  on

T he  grand  a r my  of  operations  or  active  a r my  (deistvuyushtsheye  voisko) 
consists  of eleven corps d ' a r m é e, t he corps  of g u a r d s, t he c o r ps  of grenadiers, 
six  c o r ps  of  infantry,  a nd  t h r ee  corps  of  cavalry  of  r e s e r v e. 

This  w h o le  organisation  is  imitated  from  the  system  i n t r o d u c ed by N a p o 
leon.  T he  eight  first  n a m ed  c o r ps  c o r r e s p o nd  exactly  to  t he  a r my  c o r ps  of 
t he  F r e n ch during  the  Great w a r.  T he  guards  and grenadiers  a p p e ar specially 
destined  to  f o rm  t he  general  r e s e r v es  of  t he  a r m y,  while  t he  cavalry  c o r ps 
are  e x p e c t ed  to  p r o d u ce  those  special  decisive  effects  for  w h i ch  N a p o l e on 
always  k e pt  in  r e s e r ve  large  m a s s es  of  that  a rm  and  of  artillery.  T h us  all  the 
first n a m ed  eight c o r p s,  although called  infantry  c o r p s,  are  provided  by  their 
v e ry  organisation  with  cavalry  a nd  a  n u m e r o us  artillery.  T h ey  h a ve  e a ch  a 
c o m p l e te  staff,  engineers,  p o n t o on  and  a m m u n i t i on  trains,  p a r ks  of  artillery, 
a nd  e v e ry  other  requisite  of  an  a r my  destined  to  act  independently.  T he 
guards  and grenadiers  are  rather w e a k er in infantry t h an t he other  c o r p s, then-
regiments  having  e a ch  t h r ee  battalions  only  instead  of four.  T he guards  are, 
on  the  other  h a n d,  considerably  stronger  in  cavalry  and  artillery;  b ut  it  m ay 
be  e x p e c t ed  that  in  order  of  battle  t he  greater  part  of  this  will  be  joined  to 
the  general  cavalry  and  artillery  r e s e r v e.  T he  first  a nd  second  cavalry  corps 
consist  of  h e a vy  cavalry  and  h o r se  artillery  exclusively  (the  light  regular 
cavalry  is  attached  to  the  infantry c o r p s );  the  third  cavalry or dragoon  corps 
h as  an  especial  organisation,  as  t h e se  dragoons  are  intended,  s a me  as  w as 
the  fashion  formerly,  to  fight  b o th  as  infantry  and  cavalry,  and  t h us  to  form 
a  c o r ps  of  r e s e r ve  of  all  a r m s,  having  at  the  s a me  time  t he  mobility  a nd 
rapidity  of  locomotion  exclusively  p o s s e s s ed  by  cavalry.  W h e t h er  this  will 
h a ve  b e en  attained  remains  to  be  seen;  the  e x p e r i e n ce  of  all  other  armies, 
resulting  in  the  almost  complete  and  general  c o n v e r s i on  of  d r a g o o ns  into 
simple  cavalry,  is  of  no  v e ry  favourable  augury.  This  idea  h as  e v en  b e en 
carried  to  the  extent  of  attaching b o th to  the  d r a g o on  c o r ps  and  to  the guards 
battalions  of  m o u n t ed  sappers,  miners,  a nd  pontoniers—an  institution  highly 
lauded  by  the  admirers  of  the  Russian  s y s t e m,  b ut  equally  wanting,  as  yet, 
t he  t e st  of  actual  experience. 

It m ay  be  a d d ed  that  this  organisation in  eleven  c o r p s,  w i th their divisions, 
brigades,  regiments  composing  each,  d o es  not  merely  exist  on  p a p er  or  for 
m e re  administrative  p u r p o s e s.  On  the  c o n t r a r y,  the  last  T u r k i sh  war,  the 
Polish  campaign,  t he  Hungarian  invasion,  and  t he  p r e s e nt T u r k i sh  war h a ve 
s h o wn  the  dispositions  prevailing  during  p e a ce  to  be  so  entirely  calculated 
for  w ar  that  no  division,  brigade,  or  regiment  h as  to  be  s e p a r a t ed  from  its 
c o r p s,  and  to  be  attached  to  another  w h e n e v er  the  m o v e m e nt  t o w a r ds  the 
frontiers  begins.  This  is  a great  military  advantage,  resulting from t he  almost 
c o n s t a nt  state  of  impending  w ar  in  w h i ch  R u s s ia  is  a c c u s t o m ed  to  find 
herself.  O t h er  more  peaceable  states find,  on a w ar approaching,  e v e ry wheel

Amid  all  this  confusion  and  uncertainty,  o ne  thing  alone  seems  clear,  a nd 
t h at is  t he  extinction  of  t he  M o s l em p o w er  as  a distinct  polity in E u r o p e.  T he 
emancipation  of  the  Christians  of  T u r k e y,  w h e t h er  effected  by  peaceful 
c o n c e s s i on  or  by  violence,  degrades  Islamism  from  a  political  authority  to

attention  to  their  w a nt  of  consideration  for  the  interests  of  t he  G e r m an

u n i o n.  In  this  w ay  t h ey  would  succeed  in  preventing  t he  crisis  from  ex 
tending,  and  p e r h a ps  s h o r t en  it.  T he  R u s s i an  dispatch  n e xt  p r o c e e ds  to

m on  action  with  R u s s ia  against  t he  naval  p o w e r s;  alliance  with  the  latter 
against  Russia,  or  lastly,  a  strict  neutrality.  As  to  an  alliance  with  Russia, 
t he  Czar  did  n ot  require  it,  and  as  to  an  action  against him,  it w as  impossible 
if  t he  G e r m an  p o w e rs  would n ot  submit to t he  m e n a ce  of the  w e s t e rn p o w e r s. 
This  w o u ld  be  the  a c k n o w l e d g m e nt  of  a  disgraceful  necessity  to  the  e nd  of 
bringing  a b o ut  a  deplorable  future.  Russia,  inattackable  in  her  o wn  territory, 
a p p r e h e n d ed  neither  military  invasions  nor  t he  m o re  pernicious  invasions 
of  t he  revolutionary  spirit.  If h er  allies  d e s e r t ed  her,  she k n ew h ow to restrict 
herself  to  her  o wn  r e s o u r c e s,  a nd  w o u ld  arrange  herself  so  as  to  dispense 
with  t h em  in  future,  (M.  de  N e s s e l r o de  writes  his  dispatches  in  G e r m an

confidence  in  t he  k n o wn  sentiments  of  his  friends  a nd  allies,  and  in  their 
gallant  armies,  which  had  b e en  c o n n e c t ed  long  since  with  those  of  Russia 
by  t he  b a p t i sm  of  blood,  (Bluttaufe)  a nd  by  an  identity  of  principles  n ot  to 
be  denied.  T he  third  alternative  only  t he  R u s s i an  Cabinet  thinks  w o r t hy  of 
the  G e r m an  Courts,  as  corresponding  with  their  interests,  and  a p p r o p r i a t e; 
by  continuing  their  p a r ts  as  m e d i a t o r s,  to  realize  t he  particular  desires  of 
30  Russia.  It  must,  h o w e v e r,  be  u n d e r s t o od  t h at  this  neutrality  could not be  an 
indefinite  o n e,  or  m e r e ly  provisional,  or  an  e x p e c t a nt  o n e,  b e c a u se  s u ch  an 
attitude  would  be  c o n s t r u ed  as  hostile  by  either  belligerent,  especially  by 
Russia.  T h at  neutrality  should  rather  be  f o u n d ed  on  the  principles  (of  the 
Holy  Alliance)  which,  during m a ny trials, h ad  secured t he general tranquillity 
a nd  the  p e a ce  of  the  world.  It  w as  the  d u ty  of  the  G e r m an  p o w e rs  to  give 
effect  to  this  basis  of  their  policy,  if  n e ed  b e,  by  a r m s.  If  the  o ne  (France) 
of  the  t wo  maritime  p o w e rs  should  meditate  or  v e n t u re  u p on  an  attack  of 
G e r m a n y,  t he  other  o ne  (England)  w o u ld  instantly  c h a n ge  her  position.  At 
all  instances,  if  such  an  e v e nt  should  o c c u r,  R u s s ia w as  r e a dy  to  c o me  forth

" T he  Prussian  Cabinet  had  noticed  the  m e a s u r es  t a k en  by  A u s t r ia  w i th 
a  v i ew  to  maintain  her  interests  on  t he  south-eastern  frontiers.  It  w as  t r ue

t e n a n ce  of  G e r m an  interests  required.  F r om this  motive  she  l o o k ed forward 
to  c o m m u n i c a t i o ns  on  the  following  p o i n t s:

1. W h e t h er  Austria  w as  p r e p a r e d,  in  order  to  secure  the  tranquillity  of  her

2.  W h e t h er  she  would  t a ke  possession  of  the  latter,  a nd  hold  t h em  as  a 

30 

pledge,  till  t he  restoration  of  p e a c e? 

3.  W h e t h er  she  intended  to  participate  actively  in  the  w a r ?" 
It  w o u ld  wholly  d e p e nd  on  the  answer  to  these  several  questions  for 
P r u s s ia  to  c o me  to  a  conclusion  as  to  w h at  t he  m a i n t e n a n ce  of  G e r m an

p r e s s u re  applied  to  Austria  by  the  western  powers,  (not  by  Russia!). 

On  M a r ch  14,  the  Prussian  G o v e r n m e nt  a d d r e s s ed  a  circular  N o te  to  the 

G e r m an  C o u r ts  in  t he  o ne  sense,  and  t he  Austrian  G o v e r n m e nt  in  t he  o p 
posite  s e n s e.  T he  Prussian  circulaire  says  the  impending  w ar  will  be  of  a 
purely  local  character.  Austria,  on  the  c o n t r a r y,  maintains  that  t he  struggle

b e t w e en  t he  w e s t e rn  p o w e rs  a nd  R u s s ia  should  h a ve  b e en  actually  declared.

T he  last,  b ut  n ot  least  r e m a r k a b le  information  contained  in  the  report,  is 
t he  melancholy  a n s w er  given  by  M.  de  Manteuffel  to  a  question  of  t he

In  conclusion,  we  learn  from  this  d o c u m e nt  that  the  juggle  of  t he  V i e n na 
C o n f e r e n c es  has  not  at  all  c o me  to  an  end.  On  t he  contrary,  it  states,  on the

T he  c o rn  m a r k et  is  again  rising.  T he  c a u se  of  the  late  fall  in  F r a n ce  and 
E n g l a nd  w as  the  p r e s s u re  acting u p on  speculators w h o, for w a nt of  sufficient 
capital  and  in  a  tight  m o n ey  m a r k e t,  w e re  driven  to  forced  sales  which

opinion  t h at  prices  are  yet  far  from  having  r e a c h ed  their  m a x i m u m.  It  is

a  position  from  w h i ch  they  c an  retreat,  b ut  n ot  o ne  from  w h i ch  they  c an 
a d v a n c e.  Before  t h e m,  from  Oltenitza  to  C h e r n a v o d a,  is  t he  D a n u b e,  p a s s 
able  at  a  few  points  only,  and t h o se points  defended  either by  strong batteries 
on  a  c o m m a n d i ng  shore,  or,  as  at  Silistria,  by  a  regular  fortress.  F u r t h er  on, 
from  C h e r n a v o da  to  the  sea  are  the  lakes  a nd  m o r a s s es  of  K a r a s u,  t he  Wall 
of  Trajan,  (refitted  for  defense  on  t he  points  of  passage)  t he  fortress  of 
K u s t e n d j e,  and  the  allied  fleets  on  their  flank  in  t he  Black  Sea.  B e y o nd  the 
D a n u b e,  as  well  as  b e y o nd  T r a j a n 's  Wall,  stretches  a  comparatively  b a r r en 
country,  generally  of  high  ground,  intersected  in  e v e ry  direction  by  p r e 
cipitous  ravines  f o r m ed by  n u m e r o us  rivers,  n o ne  of  which are bridged over. 
20  This  c o u n t ry  is  certainly  not  impassable  for  an  a r m y,  but  c an  only  be 
t r a v e r s ed by  a force  w h i ch  m ay  safely  e x p e ct  to  find  a  good  position,  a w e ak 
e n e m y,  a nd  plenty  of  provisions  a nd  forage  on  the  other  side.  B ut  h e re  just 
the  r e v e r se  is  the  c a s e.  If  the  R u s s i a ns  a d v a n ce  from  Trajan's  Wall  a nd  from 
Oltenitza  or  Turtukai  t o w a rd  B a z a r d s h ik  and  R a s g r a d,  t h ey  m u st  l e a ve

w h e re  do  t h ey  arrive?  W h y,  before  t he  first  a d v a n c ed  range  of  the  Balkan,

in  d e t a c h ed  corps  on  different  a nd  diverging  r o a d s.  Supposing  this  to  be 
a t t e m p t e d,  their  divided  corps  risk  being  b e a t en  in  detail  by  a  c o n c e n t r a t ed 
force  emerging  from  Shumla,  t he  r e t r e at  of  w h i ch  t h ey  c a n n ot  in  any  c a se 
cut  off.  B ut  supposing  e v en  t h at t h ey  should  o v e r c o me  all  t h e se  difficulties, 
a nd  should  appear,  say  100,000  m en  strong,  in  the  neighborhood  of  Shumla 
and  Varna,—what  t h e n?  S h u m la  is  a  position  w h i ch  n ot  only  can  be  held  by 
40,000  m en  against  100,000,  b ut  in  w h i ch  t he  smaller  force  c a n n ot  be  k e pt

I  remit  y o u,  accordingly,  in  compliance  w i th  y o ur  d e m a n d,  y o ur  p a s s p o r t s. 
As  from  this  d ay  the  diplomatic  relations  as  well  as  the  commercial  o n es  are

w ho  are  established  in  t he  p r o v i n c e s,  this  delay  will  only  be  c o u n t ed  from 
the  d ay  of  reception  of  the  order for  their  d e p a r t u r e.  It is  p r o v ed by positive

c o u n t r y.  It  h as  b e en  enjoined  on  t he  p r o p er  authorities  to  facilitate  the

Christian  and  civilized  G o v e r n m e nt  of  Austria  m a n a g es  t h e se  things  in  a

a t t a ck  on  t he  R u s s i a ns  by  t he  British  a nd  F r e n ch  fleet  in  the  Black  Sea. 
It  seems  t h at  the  British  w a r - s t e a m er  F u r i o us  w e nt  to  O d e s sa  with  a  flag

a nd  t h at  after  having  got  t h em  on  b o a r d,  she  w as  fired  at  from  t he  shore. 
T he  British  r e p r e s e nt  this  act  as  a  w a n t on  violation  of  t he  rights  of  t he

s o me  30,000  m en  for  the  assault.  It  r e m a i ns  to  be  s e en  h ow  far  this  r e p o rt 
is  t r u e,  b ut  at  any  rate  such  a  plan  is  not  i m p r o b a b l e.  I ts  success  is  another 
q u e s t i o n.  It  is  certain  that  Silistria  is  the  w e a k e st  of  all  t he  great  T u r k i sh 
f o r t r e s s e s,  c o m m a n d ed  within comfortable  dismounting  a nd b r e a c h i ng range 
by  hights  w h i ch  h a ve  not,  that we  are  a w a r e, b e en fortified  since  the last w a r. 
But  this  same  Silistria,  which  fell  in  1810  after  four  d a y s'  attack,  sustained 
in  1828-29  two  blockades  of  ten  m o n t h s'  duration,  and  held  o ut  thirty-five 
d a ys  after  t he  opening  of  a  regular  siege,  and  nine  days  after  t he  completion 
of  a  practicable  b r e a ch  in the main wall. A fortress w h i ch h as u n d e r g o ne  such 
varying  fates  m ay  well  be  said  to  be  b e y o nd  any  reasoning as  to its  strength 
a nd  defensibility. 

B ut  supposing  Silistria  to  be  carried  by  storm  by  an  o v e r w h e l m i ng  superi 
ority  of force,  it  by  no  m e a ns  follows  that  t he  r o ad  to  Constantinople  is  clear 
for  t h e m.  In  order  to  a d v a n ce  on  Shumla  and  V a r n a,  t h ey m u st  leave  at least 
6,000  m en b e h i nd  at Silistria,  which would  t h en h a ve to s e r ve t h em as bridge- 
h e ad  for  another  and  m o re  conveniently  situated  bridge.  S h u m la  t h ey could 
hardly  attack;  for  e v en  if  they  t o ok this  f a m o us i n t r e n c h ed c a m p, t h ey w o u ld 
simply  deprive  the  e n e my  of  a  good  position  w i t h o ut  gaining  o ne  for  t h e m 
selves.  S h u m la  shuts  against  the  Russians  t he  p a s s a ge  of  t he  Balkan,  b ut  if 
t a k en  it  d o es  not  o p en  that  passage  to  t h e m. 

T he  i m p o r t a n ce  of  Shumla  consists  in  the  fact t h at  V a r na is  the  key  to  the 
L o w er  Balkan,  a nd  Shumla  is  the  key  to V a r n a.  W h a t e v er  m ay be t he  defects 
of  the  fortifications  of  Varna—and  they  are  many—if  fully  garrisoned  it 
r e q u i r es  a siege-corps  of 20,000 to 30,000  m e n;  a nd unless t h e re  r e m a in t r o o ps 
e n o u g h,  after  deducting t h e s e, to  cover  the  siege  against any  sallies  from  the 
i n t r e n c h ed  c a mp  of  Shumla, w h e re t he T u r ks  c an c o n c e n t r a te  all their forces, 
the  siege  c a n n ot  be  carried  on  successfully.  V a r na  held  o u t,  in  1828,  three 
weeks  after  t wo  practicable  b r e a c h es  h ad  b e en  m a de in its  r a m p a r t s,  a nd t h at 
at  a  time  w h en  the  Russian  fleet  c o m m a n d ed  t he  Black  Sea,  and  the  T u r ks 
h ad  hardly  the  s h a d ow  of  an  a r my  to  a t t e m pt  an  a t t a ck  u p on  the  besiegers. 
N o w,  supposing  Silistria  taken,  the  various  and  v e ry  difficult  river-lines 
b e f o re  V a r na  and  Shumla  forced,  and  V a r na  b l o c k a d e d,  is  t h e re  a  c h a n ce 
that  e n o u gh  Russian  troops  would  remain  to  neutralize  Shumla?  F or  the 
T u r ks  at  Shumla  could  act  not  only  against  t he  besiegers  of  V a r n a,  b ut  in 
t he  direction  of  the  D a n u b e,  and  at  least  o ne  of  the  lines  of  c o m m u n i c a t i on 
of  the  R u s s i a n s,  so  as  to  force  t h em  to  d e t a ch  m o re  a nd  m o re  t r o o ps  from 
their  main  b o d y,  which  ultimately  might  be  w e a k e n ed  to  a  d a n g e r o us  e x

Grivas.  His  first  act  w as  to  i m p o se  u p on t he Christian population a 'patriotic' 
contribution  of  200,000 piasters.  T he  sum  n ot being  extravagant,  it w as  paid. 
But  Grivas  did  not  stop  there.  He  called  by  t u r n s,  individually,  on  all  t he 
principal  inhabitants,  and  all  t h o se  in  comfortable  c i r c u m s t a n c es  residing  in 
the  t o w n,  asking  t h em  to  deposit, likewise  as an offering, all articles of luxury 
in  gold  or  silver  w h i ch  might  be  at  their  disposal.  This  m o de  of  extortion 
excited  m u r m u r s,  a nd  it  a p p e a r ed  neither  expeditious  nor  very  productive. 
It  w as  then  that  Grivas  took  into  his  mind  an  idea  w h i ch  seems  to  us  a 
masterpiece  of  brigandage.  Taking  as  a  p r e t e x t t he  a p p r o a ch  of  the  O t t o m an 
troops  w h i ch  w e re  marching  on  M e z z o v o,  he  a n n o u n c ed  that  the  defense 
of  t he  place  necessitated  t he  almost  general  burning  of  t he  t o w n,  and,  in 
c o n s e q u e n c e,  he  invited  the  inhabitants  to  a s s e m b le  with  their  families  in 
the  principal  c h u r ch  of  M e z z o v o,  w h e re  nearly  4,000  p e r s o ns  s o on  after

t h e m,  as  also their jewels  and their  most valuable  articles,  a nd t h us  he  would 
get  into  his  p o w er  all  the  wealth  of  M e z z o v o.  He  t h en  let  t h em  o ut  in  small

t he  Occidental  p o w e rs  exhibited  firmness  and  strengthened  t he  O t t o m an 
P o r t e.  Prussia  had  not  t h en  the  mission  to  play  the  p a rt  of  an  u m p i r e.  It 
considered,  besides  t he  violated  right  of  a third  p o w e r,  a b o ve  all t he  welfare 
of  its  o wn  subjects.  Its  o wn  interest  in  the  oriental  question  is  m o re  r e m o te 
t h an  t h at  of  Austria,  which  h as  a  more  direct  interest  in  it,  and  Austria  h as 
urgently  begged  of  Prussia  not  to  refuse  her  cooperation.  P r u s s ia and A u s t r ia 
h a ve  p u r s u ed  t he  object of  moderating,  on b o th  sides, t he pretensions  p u s h ed

O ur  G o v e r n m e nt  c a n n ot  a b a n d on  a  situation w h i ch  still permits  it to  exercise 
a  salutary  influence  (for  R u s s i a)  on t he  Occidental  p o w e r s.  It  is  t he  mediat 
ing link  for  those  p o w e r s,  and  m ay  serve  as  a  s u p p o rt for  the  h o p es  of p e a c e. 
As  to  the  project  of  n o te  c o m m u n i c a t ed  by  the  four  p o w e rs  to  the  R u s s i an 
G o v e r n m e n t,  y ou  m u st  n ot  forget  that  R u s s ia  n e v er  acknowledged  the

A u s t r ia  to  p r o p o se  to  the  G e r m an  Diet  a  strict neutrality, binding for Prussia,

u n a b le  to  c o m p r o m i se  its  position  as  a  great  i n d e p e n d e nt  p o w e r,  and  the

p o w e rs  should  consider  such  an  attitude  c o n s o n a nt  with  their  interests. 
T o - d ay  the  situation  of  the  Occidental  p o w e rs  is  essentially  altered  by  their 
engagement,  ( V i e n na Protocol.)  In  t he  m o st  unfavorable  c a se  p e a ce  will not

b o m b a r d m e nt  w h i c h,  at  this  v e ry  m o m e n t,  w o r ks  u p on  it  still  m o re  p o w e r 
fully—namely,  t he  b o m b a r d m e nt of t he  public  p u r s e.  Before  entering into  an 
analysis  of  t he  financial  statement  m a de  by  Mr. G l a d s t o ne  in  y e s t e r d a y 's 
sitting  of  t he  C o m m o n s,  we  must  c a st  a  retrospective  glance  at  his  official 
transactions  hitherto. 

Mr.  Disraeli,  w h en  in  office,  had  r e d u c ed  the  interest  of  E x c h e q u er  Bills 

to  l!/4d.  a  day,  w h i ch  w as  lower  t h an  it  h ad  ever  b e en  b e f o r e;  b ut M r. Glad 
stone,  anxious  to  i m p r o ve  u p on  his  p r e d e c e s s o r,  w e nt  on  further,  reducing 
it  to  Id., neglecting to notice  the  circumstance t h at w h en M r. Disraeli r e d u c ed 
t he  interest  of  E x c h e q u er  Bills  m o n ey  w as  a b u n d a nt  a nd c h e a p,  while  it w as 
scarce  a nd  dear  w h en  M r. Gladstone  u n d e r t o ok  to  surpass  his  rival.  C o n 
sequently,  t he  great  m an  was  called u p on to  pay  t h r ee  millions  of  m o n ey  for 
E x c h e q u er  Bills, which, if left alone, would h a ve  floated  at the rate of interest 
at  w h i ch  he  found  them.  This  w as  not  all.  H a v i ng  hardly  paid  off  the 
E x c h e q u er  Bills  at  great  public  inconvenience,  t h ey  h ad  to  be  r e i s s u ed  again 
at  a  higher  r a te  of  interest.  This  w as  the first proof of  the  t r a n s c e n d e nt genius 
of  t he  Oxford  casuist,  w ho  w as  supposed  to  unite,  as  it  w e r e,  all  t he  talents 
in  his  single  p e r s o n,  the  coalition  of  all  the  talents  having  ejected  t he  T o ry 
G o v e r n m e nt  u p on  their  financial  s c h e m e,  a nd  t h us  proclaimed  finances  t he 
strong  point  of  their  policy. 

M r. G l a d s t o n e,  n ot c o n t e nt w i th dealing w i th t he  floating  debt,  m a de  a  still 
m o re  curious  experiment u p on the  funded  debt.  In April,  1853, he w e nt d o wn

might  c o m p el  him  to  p ay off  nine  and  a half  millions  at  the  e nd  of  six  m o n t hs 
and  t w e l ve  m o n t h s.  It  h as  b e en  v e ry  justly  r e m a r k ed  t h at  w h en  he  did  so 
he  h ad  before  him  the  secret  dispatches  of  Sir  H a m i l t on  S e y m o u r,  and  the 
warnings  of  Col.  R o se  a nd  Consul  C u n n i n g h a m,  c o m m u n i c a t i o ns  which 
could  leave  no  d o u bt of  t he  hostile  intention  of  t he  Russian  G o v e r n m e nt  a nd 
t he  proximity  of  a  E u r o p e an  war.  B ut  y o ur  r e a d e rs  will  recollect  t h at  at t he

the  e nd  of  the  financial  year,  to  t he  a m o u nt  of  five  or  six  millions.  I  m a de 
this  s t a t e m e nt  without  a ny  r e s p e ct to  t he  E a s t e rn complication.  Besides,  t he

T he  ordinary  E x c h e q u er  bill  is  a  security  for  12  m o n t h s,  and  is  generally 
e x c h a n g ed  or  paid  off  at t he end of t h at t i m e,  and its rate  of interest fluctuates 
with t he  m a r k et rate  of  interest.  T he  E x c h e q u er b o n d s,  on t he  c o n t r a r y, bear 
a  fixed  r a te  of  interest  for  y e a r s,  and  are  a  terminable  annuity,  transferable 
from  h a nd  to  hand  by  a  simple  indorsement,  w i t h o ut  a ny  c o st  w h a t e v er  to 
either  b u y er  or  seller.  U p on  the  whole,  t h ey  m ay  be  described  as  imitations 
of  railway  d e b e n t u r e s.  W h en  Mr. Gladstone  first  invented  t h em  in  1853,  he 
t o ok  p o w er  to  issue  30,000,000,  and  so  p r o ud  he  w as  of  his  invention  t h at

a m o u nt  he  e x p e c t ed  would  be  r e q u i r e d ."  In  order  to  raise  his  loan  of 
6,000,000, M r. Gladstone brought out t h r ee  sorts of E x c h e q u er b o n d s,  such as 
h a ve  four  y e a rs  to  run,  s u ch  as  h a ve  five  y e a rs  to  r u n,  and  s u ch  as  h a ve  six 
y e a rs  to run.  To m a ke t h em m o re acceptable to the E x c h a n g e, he decided that 
the  interest  would  be  allowed  on  installments  n ot  y et  paid.  He  p r e t e n d ed 
to  issue  t h em  at  p a r,  with  an  interest  of  t h r ee  a nd  one-half  p er  cent.,  con 
sidering t he extraordinary advantages belonging to t he n ew f o rm of securities 
as  being equivalent to  from  10 to  16 p er  cent.,  on  t he  a m o u nt  of the  dividend. 
W h en  t he  t e n d e rs  w e re  o p e n e d,  it  w as  found  that  t he  a m o u nt  bid  for  w as 
b ut  £800,000  of  b o n ds  of  the  first  series,  to  be  paid  off  in  1858;  while  with 
r e s p e ct  to  t he  other  series  of  b o n ds  of  1859  and  1860  no  offers  w e re  m a de 
at  all.  T h is  is  not  all.  He  w as  forced  to  issue  his  c o m m o d i t i es  at  a  discount, 
selling  t h em  at  t he  minimum  of  ninety-eight  and  three-fourths,  a nd throwing 
in  a  few  m o n t hs  interest,  so  that  he  is  simply  b o r r o w i ng  at  four  per  cent,  in 
e x c h a n ge  for  t he  S o u th  S ea  S t o c k s,  w h i ch  w e re  at  t h r ee  per  cent,  annuity, 
t h us  losing  on  the  capital  fifteen  p er  cent.,  and  on  t he  interest  twenty-five 
p er  cent.  Notwithstanding  all  t h e se  c o n c e s s i o n s,  his  failure  w as  c o m p l e t e, 
he  being  obliged  to  e x t e nd  the  period  for  receiving  t e n d e rs  to  t he  8th  inst., 
a nd  to  c o me  d o wn  from  his  d e m a nd  of  6,000,000  to  t he  "ridiculously  small 
s u m"  of  2,000,000.  T he  failure  w as  n e c e s s a r y,  b e c a u se  his  c o m m o d i ty  w as 
neither  well  a d a p t ed  for  p e r m a n e nt  i n v e s t m e nt  n or  for  t e m p o r a ry  use,

t h at  on  t he  6th  of  M a r ch  he  declared  it  sufficient  to  double  t he  i n c o me  t ax

liberate  plan  to  grope  in  the  dark,  to  mislead,  to  bewilder  and  to  mystify  t he

for  t he q u a c k e ry a nd t he hair splitting ingenuity of Mr.  Gladstone, b ut b e s i d es 
it  h as  to  furnish  the  Czar  with  t he  m e a ns  of  carrying  on t he w ar against itself,

attacking  force  keeping  out of range  of t he r e m a i n d e r.  Against t h e se batteries

considerably  diminished.  In respect of the  caliber, t h ey  m u st h a ve b e en a b o ut 
equal,  for  if  a  24  p o u nd  gun  is  inferior  to  a  long  32  p o u n d e r,  a  48  p o u n d er 
of  h e a vy  metal  m u st  certainly  be  equal  to  56  or  68  p o u nd  shell  g u n s,  which 
c a n n ot  stand  full  charges  of  p o w d e r.  Finally,  the  vulnerable  n a t u re  of  ships, 
as  c o m p a r ed  with  b r e a s t - w o r k s,  and  the  insecurity  of  aim  p r o d u c ed  by  t he

artillery  of  a  fleet  over  t h at of  strand-batteries  will l e a ve  s o me  o d ds  in favor

At  last,  t h e n,  we  h a ve  to  report  an  exploit  of  the  "British  T a r ."  T he  fleet of 
Admiral  Napier  has  destroyed,  after  eight  h o u r s'  b o m b a r d m e n t,  the  fort  of 
G u s t a v s v a e rn  (which  translated  from  the  Swedish  m e a ns  " G u s t a v 's  d e 
f e n c e"  or  " s t r o n g h o l d ,"  " G u s t a v 's  W e h r ")  and  t a k en t he garrison prisoners 
of  w a r,  to  t he  n u m b er  of  1,500.  This  is  the  first  serious  a t t a ck u p on  Imperial 
R u s s i an  p r o p e r t y,  a nd  c o m p a r ed  with t he d r o w sy  a nd t o r p id affair  at  Odessa, 
s h o ws  at  least  that  Charles  Napier  is  not  going  to  sacrifice  his  o wn  r e n o wn 
a nd  t h at  of  his  family  if  he  c an  help  it.  T he  fort  of  G u s t a v s v a e rn  is  situated 
on  the  extremity  of  a  peninsula,  forming  the  south-west  c o r n er  of  Finland, 
close  to  t he  lighthouse  of  H a n g o - U d d,  well  k n o wn  as  a  l a n d m a rk  to  all 
skippers  going  up  t he  Finnic  Gulf.  Its  military  i m p o r t a n ce  is  n ot  v e ry  great; 
it  defends  a  v e ry  small  a r ea either  of land  or  w a t e r,  a nd  might h a ve  b e en left 
in  t he  r e ar  by  the  attacking  fleet  without  a ny  risk  w h a t e v e r.  T he  fort  itself 
c a n n ot  h a ve  b e en  large,  as  is  evident  from  the  n u m b e rs  of  its  garrison.  B ut 
in  the  p r e s e nt  blessed  ignorance  existing  e v en  in  the  British  Admiralty  and 
W ar  Office  as  to  t he  real  strength  a nd  i m p o r t a n ce  of  t he  Baltic  C o a st  de

tactical  merits  of  t he  affair  until  fuller  particulars  h a ve  arrived.  We  can,  for

the  Circassians.  T h us  two  allied  fleets  are  going  on  the  same  errand,  the  o ne

If  the  w ar  in  the  E a st  is good for nothing else  it will at least demolish a portion

Friedrich  Engels 

English  a r m y,  replying  to  all  criticism:  " T h o se  a b u s es  a nd  absurdities  m a de 
us  victorious  in  Spain  a nd  Portugal"—perfectly  agrees  with his  c o n s e r v a t i ve 
notion  t h at  a  certain  degree  of  traditional  absurdity  a nd  corruption  w as 
essential  to  a  p r o p er  working  of  the  " d e m o n s t r a b ly  b e s t"  of  Constitutions. 
B ut  while  in  politics  he  k n ew  h ow  to  give  w ay  u p on  i m p o r t a nt  points  in 
critical  m o m e n t s,  in  military  matters  he  clung  all  t he  m o re  stubbornly  to 
antiquated  notions  a nd  traditional  T o ry  fooleries.  T h e re  w as  not  o ne  single 
i m p o r t a nt i m p r o v e m e nt  introduced  into  the  British  a r my  during his life-time, 
unless  it  w as  in  the  purely  technical  d e p a r t m e nt  of  the  artillery.  H e re  it w as 
simply  impossible  that  the  rapid  progress  of  manufacturing  industry  a nd 
m e c h a n i c al  science  should  h a ve  b e en  left  entirely  u n n o t i c e d.  T he  con 
s e q u e n ce  is,  that  though  the  British  a r my  has  t he  b e st  artillery  material  in 
e x i s t e n c e,  the  organization  of  that  artillery  is  as  c l u m sy  as  t h at  of  the  other 
a r m s;  a nd t h at  in t he  d r e s s, general a r m a m e n t,  and organization of t he  British 
f o r c es  t h e re  is  n ot  a  single  item  in  w h i ch  it  is  n ot  inferior  to  a ny  civilized 
a r my  in  E u r o p e. 

I  m u st  again  call  the  attention  of  your  r e a d e rs  to  t he  f a ct t h at the  direction 
of  military  affairs  is  not  confided,  as  in  other  c o u n t r i e s,  to  a  single  b r a n ch 
of  the  administration.  T h e re  are  four  d e p a r t m e n t s,  e a ch  clashing  with  and

The  Present Condition of the  English Army—Tactics,  Uniform,  Commissariat,  etc. 

t h e re  is  the  nuisance  of  the  "clothing  c o l o n e l s ."  E v e ry regiment has  a titular 
colonel,  a  general  officer,  w h o se  d u ty  it  is  to  p o c k et  a  certain  g o v e r n m e nt 
allowance  for  clothing  his  regiment,  and  to  spend  a  portion  only  for  the 
p u r p o s e.  T he  b a l a n ce  is  c o n s i d e r ed  as  his  w a g es  for  t he  trouble. 

T h e re  is  t he  sale  of  c o m m i s s i o n s,  w h i ch  p u ts  all  the  higher  p o s ts  in  t he 
a r my  at  t he  almost  exclusive  disposal  of  t he  aristocracy.  After  a  f ew  y e a r s' 
service  in  the  capacity  of lieutenant,  captain,  and major,  an officer  is  entitled, 
on  t he  first  v a c a n cy  occurring,  to  b uy  up  t he  n e xt  r a nk  which  b e c o m es 
v a c a n t,  unless  t h e re  should  be  an  officer  of  t he  same  rank,  and  of  older 
standing,  inclined  to  anticipate  him.  T he  c o n s e q u e n ce  is,  t h at  a  m an  with 
r e a dy  m o n ey  c an  a d v a n ce  v e ry  rapidly,  as  m a ny  of  his  seniors  h a ve  not t he 
m e a ns  to  b uy  the  v a c a n cy  as  s o on  as  it  o c c u r s.  It  is  clear  t h at  such  a  system 
greatly  n a r r o ws  the  class  of  useful  m en  from  w h i ch  the  corps  of  officers  is 
recruited,  a nd  t he  a d v a n c e m e nt  or  active  e m p l o y m e nt  of  general  officers 
being  subject  almost  exclusively  to  seniority  or  aristocratic  connection,  t he 
circle  from  which  t h e se  are  d r a wn  m u st  necessarily  exclude  a large  m a ss  of 
talent  and  knowledge  from  the  higher  c o m m a n d s.  It is, no  doubt, attributable 
to  this  system  chiefly  t h at  t he  m a ss  of  British  officers  are  so  lamentably 
deficient  in  t he  general  and  m o re  theoretical  b r a n c h es  of  military  science. 

T he n u m b er of officers is disproportionately large for t h at of t he men.  Gold 
lace  and  epaulettes  a b o u nd  in  a  British  r e g i m e nt  to  an  e x t e nt  u n k n o wn 
a n y w h e re  else.  Consequently,  t he  officers h a ve nothing to  do,  and their  esprit 
de  corps  hardly  admitting  of  any  degree  of  study,  t h ey  p a ss  their  time  in  all 
sorts  of  extravagant  a m u s e m e n t s,  trusting  that  if  it  c o m es  to  fight,  native 
b r a v e ry  and  " H er  M a j e s t y 's  r e g u l a t i o n s"  will  be  quite  sufficient  to  carry 
t h em  t h r o u gh  all  difficulties.  Y et  w h en  t he  C h o b h am  c a mp  w as  formed,  t he 
helplessness  of  v e ry  m a ny  of  the  officers  w as  c o n s p i c u o us  enough  to  any 
b o dy  w ho  could  judge  a  little  b e t t er  of  t he  m a n e u v e rs  t h an  the  p o or  en 
thusiastic  penny-a-liners  w h o,  w i th  t r ue  c o c k n ey  spirit,  admired  everything 
in  t he  strange  spectacle  which  t h ey  saw  for  t he  first  t i me  of  their  lives. 

T he  drill  regulations  and  system  of  exercise  are  of  the  m o st old-fashioned 
character.  T he  maneuvering is  exceedingly  c l u m s y,  all  t he  m o v e m e n ts  being 
complicated,  slow,  and p e d a n t i c. T he old  system of m o v e m e n ts  i n l i n e, w h i ch 
has  b e en  maintained  in  t he  British  longer  t h an  in  t he  Austrian  army,  as  t he 
grand form of all tactical m a n e u v e r s, h as  a few w e l l - k n o wn advantages w h e re 
t he  ground  allows  of  its  application;  b ut  t h e re  is  m o re  t h an  one  w ay  to 
c o u n t e r b a l a n ce  this,  and  a b o ve  all  it  is  applicable  u n d er  v e ry  exceptional 
c i r c u m s t a n c es  only.  T he  s y s t em  of evolutions  in  c o l u m n,  especially in  small 
c o l u m ns  of  c o m p a n i e s,  as  introduced  into  the  b e st  regulated  continental 
armies,  insures  a  far greater  mobility  and  an  equally  rapid formation  of  lines 
w h en  required.

T he  a r m a m e nt  of  t he  British  soldier  is  of  good  material  a nd capital  work 
m a n s h i p,  b ut  disfigured  in  m a ny  c a s es  by  old-fashioned  regulations.  T he  old 
m u s k e ts  of  s m o o th  b o re  are  well  m a d e,  of  large  caliber,  b ut  r a t h er  m o re 
h e a vy  t h an  is  n e c e s s a r y.  T he  old  B r u n s w i ck  rifle  w as  g o od  of  its  kind,  b ut 
h as  b e en  s u p e r s e d ed  by  better  a r m s.  T he recently i n t r o d u c ed Pritchett rifle, 
c o n s i d e r ed  an  i m p r o v e m e nt  u p on  t he  F r e n ch  Minié  rifles,  a p p e a rs  to  be  a 
capital  w e a p o n,  b ut  it  has  only  b e en  after  a  hard  struggle  t h at  this  arm  has 
b e en  forced  u p on  the  authorities.  As  it  is,  it  is  very  irregularly  and  u n-
systematically  introduced;  one-half  of  a  regiment  carries  m u s k e t s,  a nd  t he 
other  half  rifles,  t h e r e by  deranging  t he  w h o le  a r m a m e n t.  T he  s w o r ds  of t he 
cavalry  are  good,  of  a better  shape for t h r u st a nd  sharp  e d ge b l o ws  t h an t h o se 
of  Continental  armies.  T he  h o r s es  are  also  first-rate, b ut t he  m en  a nd  equip 
m e n ts  are  too  h e a v y.  T he / n a t e n e / of the field artillery is  the b e st in the world, 
admirably  simplified  in  some  r e s p e c t s,  b ut  indulging  in  t oo  great  a  variety 
of  calibers  and  g u ns  of  different  weight,  by  w h i ch  different  charges  of 
p o w d er  are  necessitated. 

T he  d r e s s,  on  the  contrary,  and  the  general  a c c o u t r e m e nt  of  t he  British 
soldier  is  t he  greatest  nuisance  in  existence.  A  high,  tight,  stiff  stock  r o u nd 
t he  n e c k;  a  shabby-looking,  close-fitting  c o a t ee  w i th  swallow-tails, badly c ut 
a nd  u n c o m f o r t a b l e;  tight  t r o w s e r s;  disgraceful  looking  g r e a t - c o a t s;  an  ugly 
c a p,  or  s h a k o;  a  system  of  strapping  and  belting,  of  carrying a m m u n i t i on a nd 
k n a p s a c k,  t he  like  of  which  e v en t he Prussians  c a n n ot  show—all this h as b e en 
of  late  the  t h e me  of  so  m a ny  n e w s p a p er  c o m m e n ts  t h at  a  m e re  allusion  to 
it is  sufficient.  Besides  t he  almost intentional  discomfort  of t he d r e s s, it must 
n ot  be  forgotten  that  the  British  soldier carries  a far  heavier weight than  any 
other  in t he  w o r l d;  and, as if to  m a ke mobility t he ruling principle of t he a r m y, 
it  h as  a  far  m o re  considerable  train  of  impediments  dragging  along  with  it 
t h an  any  other.  T he  clumsiness  of  the  c o m m i s s a r i at  a r r a n g e m e n ts  con 
tributes  a  great  deal  to  this,  b ut  e v en  t he  regimental  train,  a nd  particularly 
t he  great  a m o u nt  of  officers'  luggage,  s u r p a s s es  anything  k n o wn  out  of 
T u r k ey  and  India. 

N ow  see  h ow  this  a r my  m a n a g ed  w h en  the  t r o o ps  r e a c h ed  T u r k e y.  T he 
F r e n ch  soldiers,  having  p e r m a n e n t ly  incorporated  into  their  a r m y - s y s t em all 
the  a r r a n g e m e n ts  found  to  be  of  practical  utility  in  their  Algerian c a m p a i g n s,

T he  mischievous  results  naturally  flowing  from  the  D u k e 's  traditionary 
routine  are  still  aggravated  by  the  oligarchic  c h a r a c t er  of  t he  English  Ad-
20  ministration,  which intrusts the m o st important offices to m e n, w h o, although 
their  parliamentary  support  m ay  be  n e e d ed  by  t he  set  of  place-hunters  just 
in  p o w e r,  are  altogether  destitute  e v en of e l e m e n t a ry professional knowledge 
a nd  fitness.  T a ke  for  instance  Mr.  Bernal  O s b o r n e,  t he  Coalition  Clerk  of 
O r d n a n c e.  M r.  Bernal  O s b o r n e 's  nomination  w as  a  c o n c e s s i on  m a de  to  the 
25  Mayfair  Radicals,  r e p r e s e n t ed  in  t he  ministry  by  Sir  W.  Molesworth,  the

He  is  wit's  peddler,  and  retails  his  w a r es 
At  w a k es  and  wassails,  meetings,  m a r k e t s,  f a i r s ." 

B ut  although  a  small  trader  in  stale  j o k e s,  M r. B e r n al  O s b o r ne  is  hardly 
c o m p e t e nt  to  distinguish  a c o m m on m u s k et from a Minié rifle,  and,  n e v e r t h e

Y o ur  r e a d e rs  will  r e m e m b er  that  s o me  time  ago  he  applied  to  Parliament

the  small  a r ms  required  for  the  a r my  and  n a v y.  He  asserted that in the  U n i t ed

c h e a p er  rate  than  could  be  d o ne  by  private  industry,  and  that  on  several

The  Times  is  highly  indignant  that  the  British  general  h as  issued  an  order 
prohibiting  its  " o wn  c o r r e s p o n d e n t s"  to  a c c o m p a ny  the  British  army.  If  the

u n d i s t u r b ed  possession  of  P o s e n,  of  Galicia,  of  H u n g a r y,  a nd  of Italy.  L o rd 
J o hn  Russell  further  a v o ws  t h at  this  p r o t o c ol  " h as  a  t e n d e n cy  to  confirm 
and  maintain  the  principles  which  are  constituted  by  t he  V i e n na protocols— 
n a m e ly the  integrity of  the T u r k i sh  E m p i r e,  and  the  evacuation of t he Princi 
palities  by  t he  Russian  f o r c e s ."  In  fact,  it  is  a  fresh  engagement to  maintain 
t he  status  quo  ante  bellum.  T he  w e s t e rn  p o w e rs  c a n n ot  p r e t e nd  to  h a ve 
gained  any  advantage  over  R u s s ia by  this  p r o t o c o l;  for,  the  Austro-Prussian 
treaty  expressly  stipulates:  " An  offensive  and  defensive  action  on  the  p a rt 
10  of  t he  t wo  contracting  p o w e rs  w o u ld  be  o c c a s i o n e d:  firstly,  by  t he  in 
corporation  of  the  Principalities;  a nd  in  t he  s e c o nd  p l a c e,  by  an  attack  o n, 
or  a  passage  of,  the  Balkans  by  the  R u s s i a n s ."  T h e se  two  conditions  h a ve 
manifestly  b e en  dictated  by  R u s s ia  herself.  F r om  the  v e ry  first,  she  declared 
t h at  it  w as  not  her  intention  to  i n c o r p o r a t e,  b ut  to  k e ep  t he  Principalities  as 
a  "material  g u a r a n t y"  for  the  satisfaction  of  her  d e m a n d s.  To  c r o ss  t he 
Balkans  in  the  face  of  some  29,000  F r e n ch  t r o o p s,  is  an  idea  which  n e v er 
e n t e r ed  into  the  R u s s i an  plan  of  campaign,  the  only  object  of  w h i ch  is  to 
secure  some  of  t he  fortresses  on  t he  right  b a nk  of  t he  D a n u be  as  t ê t e s-
de-pont  for  her  army,  and  as  c o n s t a nt  facilities  for  an  inroad  into  Bulgaria. 
20  Be  it  r e m a r k e d,  en  passant,  that  The  Times  in  noticing  this  n ew  protocol, 

15 

25 

30

is  c o n t e nt  at  the  b e st  to  h o pe  that  A u s t r ia  m ay  h a ve  b e en gained  over  to  t he 
w e s t e rn  p o w e r s,  P r u s s ia  being  " n o t o r i o u s l y"  n ow  g o v e r n ed  by  " R u s s i an 
a g e n t s ;"  while  The Morning  Chronicle e v en d e s p a i rs  of  a ny  sincere  adhesion 
of  Austria.  T he  great  N a p o l e on  w o u ld  h a ve  forced  Austria  and  Prussia into 
o p en  alliance  with  Russia;  t he  little  o ne  p e r m i ts  R u s s ia  to  i m p o se  u p on  him 
an  alliance  with  the  G e r m an  P o w e rs  which  r e m o v es  his  a r my  to  the  greatest 
possible  distance  from  its  basis  of  o p e r a t i o n s. 

On  the  interpellation  of  M r. Milnes,  L o rd  J o hn  Russell  declared  that  "a 
force  consisting  of  a b o ut  6,000  m en  h ad  b e en  sent  from  F r a n c e,  with  in-
structions  to  o c c u py t he Piraeus.  An English regiment of infantry,  which h ad 
left  this  c o u n t ry  a b o ut  a  w e ek  ago,  should  likewise  be  p o s t ed  in  o c c u p a t i on 
of  t he  Piraeus."  T he  c a u se  of  this  m e a s u re  w as  the  conspiracy  of  t he  G r e ek 
G o v e r n m e nt  w i th  Russia.  T he  t r o o ps  w e re  to  o c c u py  A t h e ns  only in  certain 
contingencies.  We  r e ad  in  the  F r e n ch  p a p e rs  of  to-day  that  " K i ng  O t ho  h as 
a c c e p t ed  t he  ultimatum,  and  promised  t he  r e t u rn  of  the  M a u r o c o r d a t os 
Ministry,  in  case  the  o c c u p a t i on  w e re  s u s p e n d e d.  If  not,  he  w as  decided  to 
transfer  his  G o v e r n m e nt to  the  interior,  a nd  t h e re to c o n c e n t r a te his t r o o p s ." 
T h at  this  alternative  will  not  r e m a in  altogether  a  gratuitous  offer,  follows 
from  a  further  declaration  by  L o rd  J.  Russell: 

40 

"If  the  King of  G r e e ce  disapproves  of  t he  a t t e m p ts  of his  people to violate 
t he  duties  of  a  neutral  p o w e r,  he  will  find  p r o t e c t i on  in t he forces  which h a ve 

265 

Karl Marx 

b e en  sent,  a nd  the  m e a ns  of  compelling  his  people  to  o b s e r ve  those  duties. 
If,  on  t he  other  h a n d,  t he  protestations  which  we  h a ve  r e c e i v ed  from  the 
G r e ek  G o v e r n m e nt  should  turn  o ut  n ot  to  be  sincere,  t h o se  forces  might 
p r o ve  useful  in  another  w a y ." 

C o n s e q u e n t l y,  t he  G r e ek  G o v e r n m e nt  m ay  do  as  it  p l e a s e s,  G r e e ce  will

be  occupied. 

The  Times  m e n t i o ns  with  a  certain  m o r o s e n e ss  that  " F r e n ch  troops  form 
at  this  m o m e nt  t he  larger  portion  of  the  garrisons  of  R o m e,  A t h e ns  and 
C o n s t a n t i n o p l e,  t he  t h r ee  great  capitals  of  the  ancient w o r l d ."  Old N a p o l e on 
was  in  t he  habit  of  occupying  the  capitals  of  t he  n ew  world.  N a p o l e on  the 
Little,  c o n t e nt  with  the  theatrical  show  of  g r e a t n e s s,  disperses  his  armies 
over  insignificant  countries,  a nd  locks  up  the  b e t t er  portion  of  his  t r o o ps  in 
so  m a ny  culs  de  sac. 

10 

T he  withdrawal  of  the  Bribery  P r e v e n t i on  bill  in  last  night's  H o u se  gave 
o c c a s i on  to  a  highly  amusing  t o u r n a m e nt  b e t w e en  Little  J o h n n y,  Disraeli,

partial,  defeats.  T h ey  h ad  b e en  defeated on a bill  on t he  entire  c h a n ge  of the

T he  n e ws  of  the  Moniteur,  h o w e v e r,  is  notoriously  so  arranged  as  to  k e ep

assumption.  T he  Constantinople  c o r r e s p o n d e nt of  The  Chronicle,  u n d er  d a te 
of  18th  May,  o b s e r v e s:  "A  c a m p a i gn  will  scarcely  be  u n d e r t a k en  on  t he

15  o t h e r w i s e ." 

B e s i d e s,  the  ministerial  Globe  of  last  evening  publishes  an  article  con 
ceived  entirely  in  t he  same  spirit  as  t h at  of  The  Times.  It  tells  u s,  firstly,  t h at 
t h e re  are  at this  m o m e nt  "on/y "45,000 allied t r o o ps  in Turkey—29,000 F r e n ch 
a nd  16,000  English,  the  same  Globe  stating,  in  another  column,  t h at  t he 
20  R u s s i a ns  h a ve  only  90,000  m en  b e f o re  a nd  a r o u nd  Silistria,  and  that  t he 
regular  T u r k i sh  a r my in t he  field  a m o u n ts  to  104,000  men.  B ut this  aggregate 
of  nearly  150,000  Turkish,  F r e n ch  a nd  English  t r o o ps  is  n ot  d e e m ed  suffi 
cient  by  The  Globe  to  p r e v e nt  90,000  R u s s i a ns  from  taking  the  Bulgarian 
f o r t r e s s e s,  n ot  to  mention  the  c o o p e r a t i on  w h i ch  might  be  given  by  t h r ee 
powerful  fleets.  The  Globe  thinks  it  sheer  superfluity  that  either  T u r ks  or 
allies  should  fight  against  the  R u s s i a n s,  as  " t i me  is  fighting  against  t h e m ." 
In  revealing  the  plan  of  campaign  c o n c o c t ed by  t he  allied  c o m m a n d e r s,  The 
Globe  e v en  goes  a  step  further  than  The  Times,  for  it  s a y s:  " W h a t e v er

T he  fortresses  on  the  D a n u be  and  Bulgaria  are  to  be  given  up  to  Russia,

standing  to  w h i ch  the  p o et  a d d r e s s es  himself,  exactly as  the  ironical urbanity 
of  criticism  to  w h i ch  t he  late  O d e s sa  r e p o rt  of  Admiral  H a m e l in  h as  b e en

stance  of  its  being  addressed  to  t he  diplomatists  of  E u r o p e.  T he  fable  is 
h e a d e d:  T he  Eagle,  the  Bull-Dog,  the  C o c k,  a nd  the  H a r e.  "A  royal  eagle,

eagle's  e y e s?  He  has  discovered  the  h e ro  c o n c e a l ed  behind a bush.  T he eagle 
spreads  his  large  and  sturdy  wings,  and  rises  up  in  majesty.  T he  bull-dog 
b a r ks  and flies  with hasty  leaps.  In  vain, it is  t oo late.  T he  eagle  r u s h es  d o wn

T he  s p e e ch  delivered  by  K o s s u t h,  at  Sheffield,  is  the  m o st  substantial  e v er 
h e a rd  from  him  during  his  stay  in  England.  N e v e r t h e l e ss  o ne  c a n n ot  help 
finding  fault  with  it.  Its  historical  expositions  are  partly  incorrect.  To  d a te 
t he  decline  of  T u r k ey  from  t he  support  given  by  Sobieski  to  t he  Austrian 
capital,  is  a  proposition  for  which  no  g r o u n ds  w h a t e v er exist.  T he r e s e a r c h es 
of  H a m m er  p r o ve  b e y o nd  dispute  t h at  t he  organization  of  the  Turkish 
E m p i re  w as  at  that period  already  in  a  state of dissolution, a nd that the e p o ch 
of  O t t o m an  grandeur  and  strength  h ad  b e en  rapidly  disappearing  for  s o me 
time  before.  Similarly  incorrect w as t he proposition t h at N a p o l e on discarded 
t he  idea  of  attacking  R u s s ia  by  sea  for  other  r e a s o ns  t h an  t h o se  suggested 
by  his  having  no fleet,  and his being excluded from t he c o m m a nd of the  o c e an 
by  t he  British.  T he  m e n a ce  t h at if  E n g l a nd  e n t e r ed into  alliance with Austria, 
15  H u n g a ry  might  ally  herself  with  Russia,  w as  an  act  of  i m p r u d e n c e.  In  t he 
first  place  it  furnished  a  w e a p on  to  t he  ministerial  j o u r n a l s,  of  which  The 
Times  has  n ot  failed  to  m a ke  ample  u se  by  " c o n v i c t i n g"  all  revolutionists 
as  agents  of Russia.  Secondly,  it  c a me  with  a  singular  propriety  from the  lips 
of  the  m an w h o se  ministry  already  in  1849,  had  offered the H u n g a r i an c r o wn 
to  a  Cesarewitch.  Lastly,  h ow  could  he  deny  t h at  if  ever  his  t h r e at  should 
be  carried  into  execution,  either  at  his  o wn  or o t h e r s' instigation, the national 
existence  of  the  Magyar  r a ce  w o u ld  be  d o o m ed  to  annihilation,  t he  major 
p a rt  of  the  population  of  H u n g a ry  being Slavonians ?  It w as  equally  a mistake 
to  describe  t he  w ar  against  R u s s ia  as  a  w ar  b e t w e en  liberty  and  despotism. 
25  A p a rt from  the  fact  t h at  if  s u ch  be  the  c a s e,  liberty  w o u ld  be  for t he  n o n c e,

m a i n t e n a n ce  of  the  balance  of  p o w e r,  and  of  t he  V i e n na treaties—those  v e ry

" We  h a ve  r e a s on  to  believe  that  R u s s ia  will  n ot  t r e at  the  Austrian  c o m

The  Morning Chronicle of  to-day  likewise  grants  t h at  " t he  c o m m u n i c a t i on

This  attack  s h o ws  t h at  the  Russians  still  k e ep  the  initiative,  and  that,  up 
to  t he  p r e s e nt  m o m e n t,  t he T u r k s,  allied  armies  a nd  allied  fleets, are directed 
by  an  impulse  received  from  the  e n e m y.  T he  allied  fleets  are  instinctively, 
irresistibly  attracted  by  the  R u s s i an  fleet  in  its  safe  r e t r e at  at  Sevastopol; 
being  unable  to  attack  that  stronghold  w i t h o ut  a  land  force,  t h ey  are  t h us 
held  in  c h e ck  and  p a r a l y z ed  by  a  fleet  far  inferior  in  quality  and  n u m b er  of 
ships.  E v en  the  evacuation  of  the  forts  on  the  C a u c a s i an  coast,  carried  o ut 
in  p r o p er t i me  a nd u n d er the  n o se  of  t he  British  a nd  F r e n ch  s t e a m e r s,  shows 
the  determination  of  t he  Russians  to  hold  t he  lead  as  long  as  possible.  A nd 
in  w ar  this  is  a great  thing.  It  is  a  proof  of  superiority—whether  in  n u m b e r s, 
in  quality  of  t r o o p s,  or  in  generalship.  It  k e e ps  up  t he  morale  of  t he  soldier 
u n d er  all  c h e c ks  a nd  retreats  short  of  t he  loss  of  a  decisive  battle.  It  was  this 
initiative  w h i ch  held  together  Wellington's  little  a r my  in  the  midst  of  hurt-
d r e ds  of  t h o u s a n ds  of  F r e n ch  t r o o ps  in  Spain,  a nd  which  m a de it t he  center

able  to  give  the  impulse  to  the  e n e my  instead  of  receiving  it from  him,  y ou 
are  still  to  a  degree  his  superior;  a nd  w h at  is  m o r e,  y o ur  soldiers  will  feel 
t h e m s e l v e s,  individually  and  collectively,  superior  to  his  m e n.  T he  a t t a ck

In  1828-'29  the  Russians,  t h en  m a s t e rs  of  the  B l a ck  S e a,  v e ry  properly

At  p r e s e n t,  w h en the  allied  fleets  c o m m a nd  the  B l a ck  S e a,  V a r na loses  m o st 
of  its i m p o r t a n ce to the  Russians,  and  Silistria a nd S h u m la are t he  main points 
of  attack.  To  t h em  V a r na  can  n ow  h a ve  b ut  a  negative  v a l u e;  if  t h ey  t a ke

suddenly  c o n c e n t r a t e,  by  his  ships,  a  n u m b er  of  t r o o ps  for  a  special  opera-

suddenly  transshipped  a  strong b o dy  of  t r o o ps  to  their  maritime  bridge-head 
of  Fredericia,  a n d,  in  a  sally,  destroyed  the  fine,  b ut  far  w e a k er  Schleswig-

B ut  t h e se  are  considerations  of  s e c o n d a ry  i m p o r t a n ce  for  the  p r e s e n t; 
Russia,  unaided  by  Austria,  c a n n ot  think  of  passing  t he  Balkan  in  t he  face 
of  her  p r e s e nt e n e m i e s.  T he  defensive  i m p o r t a n ce  of Silistria to the Russians 
is  at  this  m o m e nt  p a r a m o u n t;  it  is  such  t h at  unless  t h ey  t a ke  it,  t h ey  m ay 
consider  their  campaign of the  year as  lost.  Silistria is  situated exactly in front

Silistria  has  u n d e r g o ne  m o re  varied  fates  t h an  any  o t h er  fortress.  In  1810

In  1828,  t he  fortress  being  exactly  in  the  same  state  as  b e f o r e,  t h ey invested

Financial  difficulties  a nd t he  E g y p t i an w a rs  compelled t he  T u r ks to  neglect

T he  Sultan  intended  to  c o n s t r u ct  d e t a c h ed forts  t h e n,  b ut for  some  time  this 
intention  w as  not  carried  out.  At t he  p r e s e nt  day,  Silistria is  in  a far  different 
s t a t e,  owing  mostly  to  the  exertions  of  a  P r u s s i an  officer  in  the  T u r k i sh 
service,  Col.  G r a c h.  T he  original  faulty  c o n s t r u c t i on  of  the  place,  p e r h a ps 
hardly  admits  of  m u ch  i m p r o v e m e n t,  b ut  t he  d e t a c h ed  forts  constructed  on

D a n u b e.  It  h as  t en  bastioned  fronts  of  an  average  length  of  500  y a r d s.  T he 
construction,  as  with  all  Turkish fortresses  of  the  sixteenth  a nd  s e v e n t e e n th 
centuries,  t e e ms  with  all  the  imperfections  of  t he  old  Italian  fortifications; 
long  curtains,  small  and  n a r r ow  bastions,  short  flanks  offering  hardly  a ny 
defense  of  t he  ditch,  t he  ditch  itself  shallow  (not  a b o ve  eight  feet  deep,)  no

scarp  w e re  riveted  to  the  hight  of  t he  ditch,  viz.,  eight  feet.  T he  ditch  itself 
is  from  the  hight  of  its  level  necessarily  d r y.  T h e re  w e re  not  e v en  lunettes

of  its  defenses  w e re  c r o w n ed  by  the  fact,  t h at within 600 y a r ds from  the wall, 
t he  fortress  is  c o m m a n d ed  by  a  range  of  hights  extending  to  t he  south  of it. 
25  T h e se  hights  are  the  a b u t m e nt of  the  Bulgarian Plateau,  which, perfectly flat

a  serious  defense  without four  d e t a c h ed forts  on t he  hights,  a nd  a bridge-head

b ut  t he  forts  are  t h e r e,  and  if  we  are  well  informed,  almost  on  the  identical

continent,  and  especially  in  Prussia,  viz:  plain  s q u a re  or  octagonal r e d o u b ts 
with  loop-holes  on  every  alternate  corner.  Their  situation  is  pointed  out  by 
the  four  p r o m o n t o r i es  which  form  the  final  projections  of  the plateau t o w a rd

effectually  p r o t e c t ed  by  the  fire  from  t he  fortress.  B ut  t h e re  is  no  absolute 
necessity  for  this;  and  there  appear  to  be  no  spots  n e a r er  the  t o w n,  on  t he 
slope,  w h e re  a  fort  could  be  well  defiladed  against  t he  c o m m a n d i ng edge  of 
t he  plateau. 

B e s i de  t h e se  p e r m a n e nt w o r k s,  Col.  G r a ch  has  c o n s t r u c t ed  on  the  plateau 
itself  an  e a r t h w o r k,  n ot  of  a  p e r m a n e nt  n a t u r e,  called  A r ab  Tabiassi,  (Fort 
Arabia,)  situated  in  front  of  the  two  central  forts,  at  a b o ut  1,000  y a r ds  dis-

position,  and  m u st be  t a k en before  the  inner  line  of  forts  c an be  a p p r o a c h e d. 
This  disposition  of  t he  w o r ks  e n d o ws  Silistria  with  great  defensive  a nd 
offensive  strength.  As  the  regular  attack  can  lead  to  decisive  results  on  its

n ot  the  m en  to  omit  sending  as  m a ny  t h o u s a n ds  to  a  storm  as  they  possibly 
can.  The-superiority  of n u m b e rs  on their p a rt  must, t h e r e f o r e,  h a ve b e en v e ry

harmoniously  e x e c u t ed  sally  operations  on  t he  part  of  t he  T u r ks  to  repulse

h a ve  carried  t he  place.  Their  p r e s e nt  r e p e a t ed  defeat  s h o ws  that  t he  T u r k s, 
at  least  p a rt  of  t h e m,  h a ve  improved  in  tactical  proficiency  and  military 
science,  without  losing  any  of  their  b r a v e r y.  In  this  r e s p e ct  t he  defense  of 
A r ab  Tabiassi  a nd  t he  engagement  of  T s h e t a te  are  t he  m o st  r e m a r k a b le 
affairs  of  t he  campaign. 

As  to  the  R u s s i an  attack,  we  c a n n ot  say  m u ch  good  of  it.  Pashkiewitch 
a p p e a rs  to  be  in  such  a  hurry  to  t a ke  Silistria  t h at  he  h as  n ot  e v en  time  for 
m e a s u r es  the  m o st  indispensable  to  effect  his  object.  H is  irresolution  is 
plainly  b e t r a y e d.  First  he  tried  a b o m b a r d m e n t,  t h o u gh  he  might h a ve  k n o wn 
h ow  useless  that  is  against  a  Turkish  t o w n.  A  b o m b a r d m e nt  c an  lead  to 
nothing  b ut  a great  loss  of a m m u n i t i on to t he  R u s s i a n s,  with p e r h a ps  a b r e a ch 
in  t he  wall  on  t he  river  front, w h e re  the  vicinity of  the  D a n u b e,  a natural ditch 
of  1,000  y a r ds  w i d e,  p r e v e n ts  all  idea  of  a  storm.  T h en  t he  land  front  is 
a t t a c k e d,  b ut  the  fire  of  A r ab  Tabiassi  a p p e a rs  n e v er  to  h a ve  b e en  silenced 
nor  any  serious  a t t e m pt  m a de  to  ruin  its  defenses.  All  t h at  is  t oo  circum 
stantial  for  a  successor  of  S u w a r o w.  As  said  that arch-Russian general,  " T he 
bullet  is  a  foolish girl,  the  b a y o n et  is  a  b r a ve  fellow,"  a nd  if this  is t r ue  with 
regard  to  the  R u s s i an  b a y o n e t,  which,  according  to  t he  same  gallant  au- 
thority,  pierces  t h r o u gh  the  Alps,  it  is  certainly  still  m o re  t r ue  w i th  regard 
to  Russian  bullets,  which  h a ve  an  invariable  and  irresistible  t e n d e n cy  to 
deviation.  So  the  storm  is  ordered,  e x e c u t e d,  r e p e a t e d,  and  again  r e p e a t e d, 
in  vain.  It  a p p e a rs  that  the  e a r t h en  parapets  of  a  small  but  strongly  built

of t he  Russians.  After  all,  Pashkiewitch will  h a ve  to  r e t u rn to  the  old m a x i m: 
N e v er  storm  a  w o rk  before  silencing  its  fire  and  ruining  its  defenses.  T h u s, 
a b o ut  t he  30th  or  31st  of  M ay  the  regular  siege  begins,  and  Pashkiewitch  at 
last  has  r e c o u r se  to  the  "foolish  bullet." 

B u t,  n o!  this e v en is  a m e re  show.  H e re  is  Gen.  Schilder of  1829 notoriety, 
w ho  promises  to  bring  d o wn  the  p l a ce  with  his  eternal  mines;  and  in  a  few 
d a ys  too.  Mines  against  a  field-work  are  the  last  expression  of  military 
despair,  of  ignorant  rage  brought  to  b a y.  If  mines  are  to  be  employed, t h e n, 
in  order  to  be  able  to  w o rk  t h em  w i th  effect,  t he  primary  condition  is  t h at 
t he  glacis  be  crowned.  Before  t he  glacis  c an  be  c r o w n e d,  t he  e n e m y 's  fire 
m u st  be  silenced;  that  is,  o n e,  t w o,  t h r ee  parallels  laid,  with  all  their  r e 
spective  batteries.  In fact,  mines  are  the  concluding  operation  of  a  siege,  n ot 
its  beginning.  U n l e ss  Schilder  p r o p o s es  to  u n d e r m i ne  some  t w e n ty  square 
miles  of  ground,  or  lay  a  tunnel  u n d er  t he  D a n u b e,  he  c a n n ot  e s c a pe  t he 
necessity  of  a  regular  siege.  In  spite  of  S u w a r o w,  t he  bullets  are  indis 
pensable. 

N o w,  a  regular  siege  against  A r ab  Tabiassi  might  be  certainly  c o n c l u d ed 
in  a  very  few  d a y s,  as  the  w o rk  h as  almost  completely  fulfilled  its  p u r p o se 
a nd  a prolonged defense  would w e a k en the  garrison too  m u c h.  B ut this  would 
be  a  regular  siege  against at least t wo forts,  a nd t h en a n o t h er against the t o w n. 
F i ve  w e e ks  is  certainly  the  v e ry  shortest  time  in  w h i ch  the  Russians  c an 
c o m p l e te  this,  slovenly  as  t h ey  are  in  siege  o p e r a t i o n s.  If,  t h e n,  t he  T u r ks 
should  h a ve  plenty  of  provisions  and  ammunition,  and  no  unforeseen  a c 
cidents  should  occur,  t he  fortress  may  be  c o n s i d e r ed  as  safe  up  to  t he 
beginning  of  July.  We  s u p p o s e,  of  c o u r s e,  that  the  forts  are  of  an  average 
strength  and  that t he walls  are  not t oo  m u ch out of repair.  But if Silistria stood 
35  days  of  o p e n ed  t r e n c h es  in  1829,  surely  with  t he  new  additions,  with  a 
b r a ve  and  intelligent  c o m m a n d e r,  an  e x p e r i e n c ed  director  of  artillery,  a nd 
a  first-rate  garrison,  it  will  be  able  to  stand  at least as  long in  1854.  If  it w e re 
possible  to  rely  on  t he  allies,  we  might  safely  say,  therefore,  that  t he  c a m 
paign  m u st  p r o ve  a  total failure  for  the  R u s s i a n s,  if  not  a great  deal  w o r s e.

On  t he  other  h a n d,  it  is  evident  t h at  t he  heroic  a nd  able  defense  of  Silistria 
c r e a t ed  equal  surprise  with  t he  allied  p o w e rs  a nd  t he  O t t o m an  Divan.  O ur

Still  it  m u st  be  said  that  our  English c o t e m p o r a r i e s,  m a ny  of  t h e m,  greatly 
exaggerate t he  extent of t he p r e s e nt M u s c o v i te r e v e r s e s. It certainly requires 
a  high  degree  of  credulity  to  believe  that  t he  sortie  m a de  by  t he  garrison  of 
Silistria  on J u ne  13,  and the  succor of 2,000  m en t h ey are  said to h a ve received 
from  O m er  Pasha,  resulted  in  the  total  defeat  of  the  R u s s i a n s,  a nd  forced 
90,000  to  100,000  m en to fly before  15,000.  T he  s u d d en retreat of the Russians 
is,  so  far  as  we  c an  judge,  quite  as  m y s t e r i o us  as  their  s u d d en  attack.  It  is 
only  to  be  explained  by  a previous  u n d e r s t a n d i ng  with  Austria,  involving  t he 
o c c u p a t i on  of  Wallachia  by  A u s t r i an  t r o o p s.  U n d er  t h e se  c i r c u m s t a n c e s,  the 
following  p a s s a ge  w h i ch  we  find  in  a  letter  of  The  Morning  Chronicle's 
Constantinople c o r r e s p o n d e n t, revealing this plot on J u ne 10, as early as f o ur 
d a ys  before  the  conclusion  of  t he  Austro-Turkish  treaty,  is  of  a  peculiarly 
interesting  c h a r a c t e r: 

" T he  T u r ks  think  t h at  diplomacy  is  playing  w i th  t h e m,  and  that  it  is  their 
intention  to  allow  Silistria  to  fall  into  t he  h a n ds  of  Russia.  T h e se  suspicions 
receive  confirmation  from  the  n e ws  that  has  b e en  received  h e re  of  t he 

preparation  of  a  new  protocol  at  Vienna,  in  w h i ch  t he  fall  of  Silistria  i s,  I 
l e a r n,  s p o k en  of  as  if  it  were  accomplished;  a n d,  the  military  honor  of  Russia 
being satisfied,  Austria would c o n s i d er t he t i me to  h a ve  arrived for h er a r m ed 
intervention  to  bring  a b o ut  an  a r r a n g e m e nt  by  t he  m e a ns  of  her  co-opera 
tion—occupying  the  Danubian  Principalities,  which  would  be  evacuated  by 

35 

the  armies  of Russia." 
A c c o r d i ng  to  this,  if  t he  Russians  h ad  t a k en  Silistria  in  d ue  time,  all w o u ld 
h a ve  b e en  right.  B ut  t h o u gh  t h ey  did  not  s u c c e ed  in  satisfying  t he  military 
h o n or  of  the  Czar,  they m u s t,  according to  t he c o m p r o m i se with Austria, b e at

position  t h ey  are  arbiters  of t he  quarrel,  preventing b o th parties from moving 
forward.  T he R u s s i a ns r e m a in in Moldavia, while  t he V i e n na C o n f e r e n ce will 
be  m o re  t h an  e v er  b u sy  itself  with  protocols,  a nd  t h us  the  winter  will  be

H o pe  &  C o.  of  Amsterdam—the  position  of  t he  R u s s i an  a r my  behind  t he 
D a n u be  and  the  Sereth  will  be  twice  as  strong  as  w as  its  line  b e t w e en 
B u c h a r e st  and  Kustendje.  Besides,  if  we  look  at  t he  relative  strength  of  t he 
R u s s i a ns  before  Silistria  and  in  Bulgaria,  n ow  on  their  r e t r e at  b e h i nd  the

a r r a n g e m e n t s,  be  t h r o wn  at  all  into  the  b a l a n c e,  it  is  plainly  s e en  that,  with 
e v en  t he  b e st  intentions,  t he  latter  would  not  be  c a p a b le  of  baffling  this 
combination  of  Austria  with  Russia. 

T he  Russian  forces  employed  against  T u r k ey  and  the  allies  on  the  E u 
r o p e an  shores  of  the  Black S ea a m o u nt to thirteen divisions of infantry, t h r ee 
of  the  third,  t h r ee  of  the  fourth, o ne of  the fifth, t h r ee  of t he  sixth a r my c o r p s, 
and  t h r ee  r e s e r ve  divisions.  Besides  t h e s e,  t he  third,  fourth,  fifth  and  sixth 
divisions  of  light  cavalry,  and  the  third,  fourth  a nd  fifth  divisions  of artillery. 
T h e se  t r o o p s,  making  up  nearly  one-half  of  t he  grand  a r my  of  o p e r a t i o n s, 
should  a m o u n t,  according  to  the  official  s t a t e m e n t s,  to  16,000  m en per  divi- 
sion  of  infantry,  5,000  per  division  of  cavalry,  a nd  160  g u ns  per  division  of 
artillery;  altogether  something like  250,000 to  260,000  m e n,  inclusive  of  train 
a nd  c a mp  followers.  But,  if  we  m e a s u re  t he  strength  of  a  Russian  a r my  by 
w h at  it  actually  w as  in  the  Hungarian  w a r,  we  c a n n ot  estimate  a  division  of 
R u s s i an  infantry  at  more  t h an  13,000  to  14,000  m e n,  a nd  t he  cavalry  and 
artillery  m u st  be  r e d u c ed  in  proportion.  T he  actual  f o r c e s,  t h e n,  w h i ch  the 
R u s s i a ns  h a ve  successively  m a r c h ed into t he Principalities  w o u ld be  r e d u c ed

a c c o u nt  of  loss  in  battle  and  by  sickness,  at  least  20,000  to  25,000  m o r e. 
Recollecting t he  ravages  m a de  by  the marsh-fever in t he r a n ks of the R u s s i an 
a r my  during  1828-29,  and  comparing  t he  letters  of  a  R u s s i an  surgeon  in  t he

N ow  let  us  see w h at force  t he  allies  h a ve to  o p p o se  to  the  180,000 R u s s i an 
total  at  this  moment.  T he  T u r k i sh  a r my  at  S h u m la w as  stated,  s o m e t i me  ago, 
to  be  a b o ut  80,000  strong,  b ut  short  of  everything  required  for  action  in  t he 
o p en  field,  and  is,  according  to  t he  latest  r e p o rt  of  L o rd  Raglan  a nd  F r e n ch 
staff  officers,  badly  officered,  altogether  in  a  condition  w h i ch  peremptorily 
forbids  offensive  operations.  It is  neither  o ur p u r p o se  n or  within o ur p r e s e nt 
m e a ns  to  d e t e r m i ne  the  accuracy  of  this  r e p o r t.  Suffice  it  to  say  t h at  such 
is  the  c h a r a c t er  of  t he  T u r k i sh  main  a r my  in t he  official  opinion  of  its  allies. 
Since  then  the  troops  from  Kalafat  h a ve  b e en  d r a wn  to  R u s t c h u k,  w h e re  a 
c a mp  of  40,000  m en is  said to be establishing.  It w o u ld be  difficult to  c o n c e i ve 
the  policy  of  thus  rendering  idle  a  corps  of  s u ch  strength,  which,  if  it  h ad 
m a r c h ed  u p on  B u c h a r e st  instead  of  R u s t c h u k,  might  h a ve  compelled  t he 
Russians  to  raise  immediately  the  i n v e s t m e nt  of  Silistria,  b ut for the  c o n d u ct 
of  t he  war  being  entirely  in t he  h a n ds  of  diplomacy.  Setting  apart t he p r e s e nt 
garrison  at  R u s t c h uk  a nd  the  garrison  and  r e s e r ve  at  Shumla,  it m ay well  be 
d o u b t ed  w h e t h er  the  T u r ks  c an  muster  50,000  m en  in  the  o p en  field  in  a 
condition  fit  for  the  w o rk  before  t h e m.  An A n g l o - F r e n ch  soldier being equal, 
in  t he  estimation  of  w e s t e rn  military  authorities,  to  at  least  t wo  R u s s i a n s, 
t h e re  would  still  be  required  a  force  of  65,000  allies  to  balance  the  strength 
of  t he  Russian  a r my  of  occupation.  U n l e s s,  t h e r e f o r e,  t h ey  c an  muster  t h at 
force  at  V a r na  t h ey  w o u ld  hardly  go  to  battle, t he  case  of e x t r e me  necessity 
excepted. 

T h ey  h a ve  h o w e v er  b e en  m o st  careful  n ot  to  d r op  at  o n ce  into  the  field 
in  s u ch  force  as  would  leave  no  further  p r e t e xt  for  abstaining  from  active

of  t r a n s p o r ts  at  h a nd  in  the  B o s p h o r us  is,  w h e t h er intentionally  or  not,  v e ry

" t h e re  are  at  p r e s e nt  b ut  12,000  British  and  F r e n ch  t r o o ps  w ho  h a ve  b e en

from  Gallipoli  t o w a rd  Constantinople  and  A d r i a n o p l e ."  T he  r o a ds  being 
notoriously  bad  and  the  difficulty  of  victualling  e x t r e m e,  an  a r r a n g e m e nt 
w h i ch  allows  their  famous  General—St.  Arnaud—to  be  p e r m a n e n t ly  u n d er 
s t e am  b e t w e en  V a r na  and  Constantinople,  w h e re  we  m ay  be  sure  he  d o es 
n ot  lose  an  opportunity  for  turning  every  intrigue  in  t he  Divan  to  a  solid 
a d v a n t a ge  for  his  unfathomable  purse.  As  to  the  t wo  British  divisions  still  at 
Scutari,  we  are  informed  by  t he  same  c o r r e s p o n d e nt t h at  " t h ey  do  n ot  s e em

at  anchor,  waiting  to  e m b a rk  t h e m ." 

F r om  all  t h e se  facts  it  is  sufficiently  clear  to  e v e r y b o dy  that  the  allied 
p o w e rs  h a ve t a k en full care  n ot to be in a  state to frustrate  directly t he p r e s e nt 
a r r a n g e m e nt  b e t w e en  R u s s ia  and  Austria.  F o r,  if  it  w e re  intended  to  p u r s ue 
t h at  object,  a  v e ry  simple  alternative  for  doing  so  offers  itself  either  by  an 
Anglo-Swedish  alliance  in the  Baltic, w h i ch w o u ld  give  a basis  of  operations 
for  auxiliary  t r o o ps  by  facilitating  an  invasion  of  Finland  a nd  a  turning  on

a t t a ck by  sea  a nd  land  on  t he  Crimea  a nd  Sevastopol.  W i th  regard to t he first

a nd  an  immediate  r e t u rn  of  the  greater  portion of t he  Baltic  fleet  to t he Black 
S e a,  w h e re  it  suddenly  a d v o c a t es  the  o c c u p a t i on  of  the  Crimea.  This  is  the

N a p i er before  t he  F r e n ch fleet  should  h a ve  joined  him.  N ow  t h at it h as  d o ne

T he  r e t r o g r a de  m o v e m e nt of  the  Russians  in T u r k ey is  m u ch  m o re  complete 
t h an  we  h ad  supposed  it  could  b e,  and  m o re  t h a n,  e v en  in  t he  w o r st  c a s e,

of  the  C z ar  to  t he  E m p e r or  of  Austria  and  his  o r d e rs  to  his  Generals  include 
the  total  evacuation  of  Moldavia  as  well  as  Wallachia,  leaving  not  a  Russian 
soldier  on  T u r k i sh  ground,  while  a  powerful  A u s t r i an  force  will  instantly 
c o me  f o r w a rd  to  t a ke  their place  and  enforce  a  separation b e t w e en the  r e c e nt 
c o m b a t a n t s.  B ut  it  would  be  an  error to  s u p p o se  t h at t he  R u s s i a ns  withdraw 
b e c a u se  of  their  defeat  at  Silistria or  to  a c c e pt for  t r u th  the  blustering  asser 
tions  of  t he  English  journals,  which give to t h at defeat t he c h a r a c t er  of a rout, 
that  15,000  or  at  the  u t m o st 
and  w o u ld  fain  m a ke 
17,000  m e n,  sallying  from  the  fortress,  could  drive  a w ay  100,000  or  at  the 
least 90,000.  T he  Russians w e re repulsed b e y o nd  a d o u b t,  bloodily  and utterly 
repulsed  again  and  again,  as  their  precipitate,  ill  c o n s i d e r e d,  unscientific, 
confused  attacks  d e s e r v ed  to  b e,  bravely  as  t h ey  w e re  e x e c u t e d;  the  T u r ks 
fought  with  heroic  courage  that  never  was  s u r p a s s e d,  a nd  with  a  degree  of 
military  skill  t h at m u st  m a ke  this  siege  m e m o r a b le  in  all  history;  b ut we h a ve 
y et  to  see  any  r e a s on  for  believing  that  t h ey  compelled  t he  e n e my  to  raise 
the  siege.  Indeed,  our  best  information  is  to  the  effect  that  the  Russian 
batteries  on  t he  left  b a nk  w e re  still  held  a nd  e m p l o y ed  against  t he  fortress

t he  R u s s i a ns  finally  withdrew  from  before  Silistria  simply  b e c a u se  the  C z ar 
h ad  agreed  with  Austria  that  on  a  certain  day  his  t r o o ps  should  all  be  out 
of  the  Principalities.  He  had  ordered  t h em  to  t a ke  Silistria  b e f o r e h a n d,  in 
o r d er  to  leave  T u r k ey  with  the  prestige  of  at  least  o ne  victory;  in  that  t h ey

and  probably  would  not,  h a ve  b e en  able  to  t a ke  Silistria  e v en  by  a  regular 
siege;  t h ey  probably  could  n ot  h a ve  gained  anything from  t he  campaign,  a nd 
in  t h at  e v e nt  might  h a ve  retired  u p on  the  S e r e t h;  b ut  they  w e re  still  stronger 
t h an  the  allies,  T u r ks  and  all,  and,  for  defensive  p u r p o s es  at  least,  far 
stronger.  B e s i d e s,  the  allies  had  n ot  y et b e en  b r o u g ht  against  t h e m,  and  no 
decisive  battle  h ad  b e en  fought.  It  is,  therefore,  certain  t h at  this  r e t r e at  to 
the  Pruth  is  dictated  by  diplomatic  considerations,  and  n ot  by  any  military 
necessity  growing  o ut  of  t he  superior p o w er or b e t t er  strategy  of  O m er P a s ha 
and  the  allies  in  T u r k e y. 

B ut  while  it  would  be  a  mistake  to  s u p p o se  the  R u s s i a ns  w e re  actually 
driven  from  b e f o re  Silistria,  it  would  be  equally  a  mistake  n ot to  see  that t he 
w ar  generally  is  going  against  t h e m,  and  t h at  the  A u s t r i an intervention offers 
the  b e st  m e a ns  of  mending  their  f o r t u n e s.  We  do  n ot  h e re  allude  to  their 
successive  r e v e r s es  at  Oltenitza,  T s h e t a t e,  K a r a k a l,  or  Silistria,  c o m-
paratively  small  affairs,  in  which  the  T u r ks  b e at  t h e m,  and  which t h ey  h a ve 
n o w h e re  m a t c h ed  with  successes  of  equal  brilliancy.  All  of  these  conflicts 
together  had  no  decisive  or  d e s p e r a te  results;  b ut  in  Asia  their  g a me  has 
steadily  b e en  a  losing  o n e,  and  the  loss  n ow  t h r e a t e ns  to  b e c o me  final.  Of 
their  n u m e r o us  forts  on t he  Black  S ea  only  t wo  r e m a i n;  while  inland  Shamyl 
and  his  mountaineers  h a ve  n ot  only  freed  their  immediate  hills  and  valleys 
from  the  h a t ed  Muscovite,  b ut  h a ve  cut  off  the  c o m m u n i c a t i o ns  of  Prince 
Woronzoff  with Russia,  and,  acting with the  T u r ks  on t he  south, are  marching 
u p on  Tiflis  with  a  strength  which  m ay  possibly  c o m p el  the  s u r r e n d er  of t he 
Prince  w i th  all  the  hard-got  and  painfully-held  T r a n s c a u c a s i an  p o s s e s s i o ns 
of  Russia.  To  lose  t h e se  p r o v i n c e s,  which  h a ve  c o st  such  v a st  a m o u n ts  of 
blood  and  t r e a s u r e,  would  b e,  if  possible,  a  greater  mortification to  the  Czar 
t h an  defeat  in  a  pitched  battle  in  T u r k e y;  and  t h e re  is  no  d o u bt  that,  so  soon 
as  his  armies  are  b a ck  a c r o ss  the  Pruth,  he  will  at o n ce  d e v o te  all  the  forces 
he  c an  spare  from  the  defense  of  t he  C r i m ea  and  of  Sevastopol,  to  t he  w o rk 
of  regaining  the  p a s s es  of  the  C a u c a s us  and  relieving  Woronzoff.  T he  suc 
c e ss  of  Shamyl  h as  in  all  probability  contributed  m u ch  t o w a rd  t he  Russian 
compliance  with  t he  Austrian  s u m m o ns  to  e v a c u a te  t he  Principalities. 

In  this  important transaction,  w h i ch so  changes  and complicates t he a s p e ct 
of  t he  war,  Austria  holds  the  p o st  of  h o n or  a nd  of  advantage.  It  is  a  great 
triumph  for  her  diplomacy,  and  testifies  to  the  r e s p e ct  in w h i ch her military 
r e s o u r c es  are  held by  all  the  c o n t e n d i ng parties.  S he  i n t e r v e n es  as  t he  friend

only  follows  t he  advice  of  F r a n ce  and  England  in  signing  t he  t r e a ty  which 
gives  the  Principalities  to  her  o c c u p a t i o n.  She  is  t h e r e,  t h e n,  as  an  armed

Of  c o u r s e,  like  e v e ry  other  p o w e r,  A u s t r ia p u r s u es  her  o wn  interest alone. 
T h at  interest  requires  on  t he  one  hand  t h at  R u s s ia  should  n ot  hold  t he

therefore  plain  that  Austria  never  c an  c o n s e nt  to  the  a b s o r p t i on  of  T u r k ey 
by  Russia,  unless  she  receives  at  the  same  time  an  equivalent  addition  of 
territory  and  p o w er  elsewhere,  which  is  impossible.  B ut  on  t he  other  h a n d, 
the  sympathies of Austrian policy are  all with the C z ar a nd o p p o s ed  to  F r a n ce

T h at R u s s ia  should  be  humiliated  as  a p u n i s h m e nt for making a needless w a r,

L o n d o n,  T u e s d a y,  J u ne  27,  1854. 

T he  R u s s i an  Moniteur  of  B u c h a r e st  officially  declares  that,  in  obedience  to 
o r d e rs  sent  from  St. Petersburg,  t he  siege  of  Silistria  is  raised,  Giurgevo 
e v a c u a t e d,  and  the  whole  Russian  a r my  a b o ut  to  r e c r o ss  t he  P r u t h.  The 
Times,  in  a  third  edition  of  y e s t e r d a y,  published  a telegraphic  dispatch  from 
its  V i e n na  c o r r e s p o n d e nt  to  a  similar effect,  viz:  t h at " t he  E m p e r or  of  R u s s ia 
a c c e p ts  t he  Austrian  s u m m o ns  out  of  high  consideration for  his  ancient  ally, 
a nd  h as  ordered  his  t r o o ps  to  r e c r o ss  the  P r u t h ."  L o rd  J o hn  Russell  in  last 
night's  H o u se  of  C o m m o ns  confirmed  t he  s t a t e m e nt  with  regard  to  t he 
a b a n d o n m e nt of  the  siege  of  Silistria, b ut h ad  received  no  official information 
a b o ut  t he  answer  given  by  Russia  to  the  Austrian  s u m m o n s. 

T he  result  of  t he  Austrian  intervention  will  be  to  interpose  a  barrier 

b e t w e en  t he  T u r ks  and  t he  Russians,  to  secure  t he  r e t r e at  of t he latter from 
all  molestation,  to  enable  t h em  to  reënforce  the  garrison  of  S e v a s t o p ol  and 
t he  Crimea,  and  p e r h a ps  to  reestablish  their  c o m m u n i c a t i o ns  with  t he  a r my 
of  Woronzoff.  Besides  the  r e c o n s t r u c t i on  of  the  H o ly  Alliance  b e t w e en 
Russia,  Austria  and  Prussia  m u st  be  looked  u p on  as  certain t he  m o m e nt t he 
allied  p o w e rs  refuse  to  acquiesce  in  the  simple  r e s t o r a t i on  of  the  status  quo

of  w h i ch  w as  mainly  raised  by  the  P a l m e r s t o n i an  p r e s s,  h ad  failed,  and  t he 
Peelite  D u ke  of  N e w c a s t le  supplanted  t he  noble  L o rd  in  his  c o n t e m p l a t ed

high  time  to  b r e ak  up  t he  w h o le  Cabinet,  and  accordingly  he  h as  raised  a 
perfect  storm  against its  chief,  t he  o c c a s i on for  w h i ch w as  afforded  by  L o rd 
A b e r d e e n 's  inconsiderate  s p e e ch  in  reply  to  L o rd  L y n d h u r s t.  T he  w h o le 
English  p r e ss  immediately  laid  hold  of  t h at  s p e e c h.  It is,  h o w e v e r,  i m p o r t a nt 
to  add,  t h at  The  Morning  Herald d e n o u n c ed  t he  e x i s t e n ce  of  a c o n s p i r a cy 
against  L o rd  A b e r d e en  before  the  speech  w as  delivered.  M r. L a y a rd  r o se 
in  t he  H o u se  of  C o m m o ns  on  F r i d ay  last,  a nd  g a ve  notice t h at on T h u r s d ay 
n e xt  he  should  m o ve  a  resolution  t h at  " t he language  held by the first Minister 
of  t he  C r o wn  w as  calculated  to  raise  grave  d o u b ts  in  t he  public  mind  as  to 
the  objects  and  e n ds  of  the  w a r,  a nd  to  lessen  t he  p r o s p e c ts  of  an h o n o r a b le 
a nd  durable  p e a c e ."  T h e re  are  t wo  w e ak  points  in this  resolution:  firstly,  its 
being  unconstitutional  and  apt  to  be  set  aside  for  being  in  contradiction  to 
t he  Parliamentary  rule  which  forbids  t he  criticism  of  a  speech  delivered  in 
the  L o r ds  by  a m e m b er  of  the  C o m m o n s;  a n d,  secondly,  b e c a u se  it p r e t e n ds 
to  distinguish  b e t w e en  the  occasional  language  of  the  Premier  and t he  whole 
acts  of  the  coalition  Cabinet.  N e v e r t h e l e s s,  its result w as to give  such serious 
a p p r e h e n s i o ns  to  L o rd  A b e r d e en  that,  t wo  h o u rs  after  t he  a n n o u n c e m e nt 
of  the  a b o ve  resolution,  he  r o se  in  his  p l a ce  and  gave  notice,  in  an unusually 
excited  t o n e,  that  " on  M o n d ay  next,  (thus  anticipating  Mr.  L a y a rd  by  t h r ee 
days,)  he  should  m o ve  for  a  c o py  of  the  dispatch  he  h ad addressed to Russia, 
after  t he  t r e a ty  of  Adrianople,  and  t h at  he  w o u ld  t a ke  t he  opportunity  of 
alluding  to  the  misconstructions  w h i ch  h ad  b e en  placed  on  the  r e m a r ks  he 
h ad  recently  a d d r e s s ed  to  their  L o r d s h i ps  on  t he  subject  of  the  w a r ." 

So  strong  w as  the  belief  that  M r. L a y a r d 's  m o t i on  would  result  in  the 
expulsion  of  L o rd  A b e r d e en  from  t he  Cabinet,  t h at  The  Morning Advertiser, 
for  instance,  has  published  already t he list of the Ministry which is  to  succeed 
him;  a list including the  n a m es  of  L o rd J o hn Russell  as  Premier,  and  of  L o rd 
P a l m e r s t on  as  Minister  of  W a r.  It  m ay  be  imagined,  t h e n,  t h at  the  sitting  of 
the  L o r ds  of last night  attracted  an u n u s u al  n u m b er of t he  curious  and excited 
intrigants  of  the  aristocracy,  anxious  to  w i t n e ss  in  w h at  m a n n er  L o rd  A b e r

acquainted  only  imperfectly  with  our  c o n v e r s a t i on  with  t he  first  Minister, 
he  labored,  w h en  he  learned  the  details  of  it,  to  soften  t he  disagreeable 
impressions  t h at  might  h a ve  b e en  left  u p on  us  by  his  language  at  t he  c o m 
m e n c e m e nt  of  it,  by  the  reiterated  a s s u r a n ce  that at no period had it entered 
into  the  intentions  of  England  to  seek  a  quarrel  with  Russia;  t h at  if  t he 
ministry  had  sought  to  induce  us  not  to  insist  on  t he  b l o c k a de  of  E n o s,  it 
w as  in  t he  full  desire  to  prevent  i m p o r t u n a te  r e c l a m a t i o n s,  and  to  c e m e nt

w e re  v e ry  far  from  his  spirit  and  from  his  policy.  B u t,  on  t he  other  h a n d, 
he  found  himself  in  a  delicate  situation.  Public  opinion  w as  always  ready  to 
b u r st  forth  against  Russia.  The  British  Government  could  not  constantly 
brave  it,  and  it  would  be  d a n g e r o us  to  excite  it  on  q u e s t i o ns  (of  maritime

L o rd  A b e r d e en  b e g an  by  saying  t h at  he  had  nothing  either  to  r e t r a ct  or 
to  contradict,  b ut  only  to  " e x p l a i n ."  He  h ad  b e en  falsely  accused  of  having 
claimed  the  honor  of  having  framed  the  treaty  of  Adrianople.  Instead  of 
having  framed  it,  he  h ad  p r o t e s t ed  against  it,  as  their  lordships  would  see 
from  the  dispatch  for  the  production  of  w h i ch  he  n ow  m a de  a  motion.  Such 
h ad  b e en  t he  alarm  p r o d u c ed  on  his  mind,  a nd  on  his  colleagues'  mind,  by 
t h at  treaty,  t h at  the  w h o le  policy  of  the  G o v e r n m e nt  had  b e en  changed  in 
a  m o st  material  point in  c o n s e q u e n ce  of its  existence.  Which w as this change 
of  policy?  Before  the  treaty  of  Adrianople  w as  signed,  h e,  L o rd  A b e r d e en 
a nd  the  D u ke  of  Wellington,  therein  following  t he  policy  of  Canning,  h ad

as  a  vassal  state  u n d er  t he  suzeraineté  of  t he  P o r t e,  s o m e w h at  similar  to 
Wallachia  and  Moldavia.  After  the  treaty  of  Adrianople  had  b e en  signed, t he 
condition  of  t he  Turkish  E m p i re  a p p e a r ed  to  t h em  so  perilous,  and its  exist

into  an i n d e p e n d e nt kingdom.  In other w o r d s, it w as resolved,  since t he treaty

A l t h o u gh  their  alarm  for the  c o n s e q u e n c es  of t h at t r e a ty h ad b e en exagger 
ated,  L o rd  A b e r d e en  w as  far  from  not  considering  it  as  in  t he  highest  degree 
disastrous  and  prejudicial.  He  had  said  t h at  " R u s s ia  had  n ot  acquired  great 
territorial  acquisitions  by  t h at  t r e a t y ,"  a nd  e v en  n ow  he  c o n t e n d ed  t h at  t he 
R u s s i an empire had  not greatly increased in E u r o pe within the last fifty y e a r s, 
as  L o rd  L y n d h u r st  h ad  asserted  (Bessarabia,  Finland,  and  t he  kingdom  of 
Poland,  a p p e ar  not to  be  any  significant  acquisitions  in  the  view  of  the  noble 
lord.)  B u t,  as  he  h ad  stated in his  dispatch of D e c e m b e r,  1829, if t he territorial 
acquisitions  of  R u s s ia  had  b e en  small,  t h ey  h ad  b e en  i m p o r t a nt  in  their 
character—the  o ne  giving  Russia "exclusive  authority  o v er t he navigation of

in t he  C a u c a s us  is  again  n ot p r e s e nt to  L o rd A b e r d e e n 's mind.)  Starting from 
this  point  of  view,  he  asserts  that  t he  t r e a ty  of  Adrianople  w as  t he  c o m 
m e n c e m e nt of  a change  of policy on the  p a rt of Russia, w h i c h,  since the time 
of  t h at  treaty,  h ad  looked  to  an  extension  of  political  influence  rather  t h an 
to  the  acquisition  of  territory.  This  change  of  policy  h ad  n ot  b e en  a  change 
of  intention.  " S a t an  h ad  only  g r o wn  wiser  t h an  in  d a ys  of  y o r e ."  T he  fact 
that  R u s s ia  c o n c e r t ed  a  plan  with  Charles  X  for  the  acquisition  of  Turkey— 
not  t h r o u gh  alarming  c o n q u e s t s,  b ut  t h r o u gh  a  series  of  treaties—is  p a s s ed 
over  in  silence.  N or  did  L o rd  A b e r d e en  think  fit  to  m e n t i on  t h at  e v en  before 
t he  t r e a ty  of  Adrianople  and  t he  t r e a ty  of  U n k i ar  Skelessi,  which  he  quotes 
in  proof  of  the  change  in  Russian policy,  R u s s ia h ad  b o u nd  herself  to  F r a n ce 
and  England  already,  in  1827,  not to  seek to  derive  any  further territory from 
the  w ar  against  T u r k e y,  and  that,  b ut  for  the  permission  of  England,  she 
would  n e v er  h a ve  b e en  able  to  a d v a n ce  an  a r my  u p on  Constantinople  in 
1833. 

L o rd  A b e r d e en  n e xt  stated  that  his  e x p r e s s i on  t h at  "if  we  could  obtain

take  a  m o re  active  p a rt  in  the  o p e r a t i o ns  of  the  w a r ."  This  w as  the  c o u r se 
he  invariably  urged.  On  t he  interpellation  of  L o rd  B e a u m o n t,  he  declared 
that  "intimate  as  he  formerly  w as  with  Prince  M e t t e r n i c h,  since  he  h ad  b e en

A b e r d e e n 's  s p e e ch  w a s,  on  the  w h o l e,  favorably  received  by  the  H o u s e;

T he  M a r q u is  of  Clanricarde  principally  dwelt  u p on  A b e r d e e n 's  participa-

In  lieu  of  similar  speculations  on  t he  possible  m e a n i ng  of  Austria's  p r e s e nt

J u ne  14,  which  is  n ow  fully  and  officially  m a de  k n o w n. 

T h e re  are  t wo  points  to  be  considered—the  relations  b e t w e en Austria  and 

309 

Karl Marx 

T u r k ey  a nd  t he  relations  of  the  Moldo-Wallachian  p e o p le  to  T u r k ey  a nd 
A u s t r ia  or  other  foreign p o w e r s,  the latter point being,  strange to  say, entirely 
neglected  by  t he  diplomacy-ridden  opinion  of  E u r o p e. 

By  the  first  article  of  the  treaty,  " t he  E m p e r or  of  A u s t r ia  u n d e r t a k es  to 
e x h a u st  e v e ry  m e a ns  of  negotiation  and  o t h e r s,  to  obtain  t he  evacuation  of

e v en  to  employ,  in  c a se  of  need,  t he  n u m b er  of  t r o o ps  calculated  for  t h at 
o b j e c t ."  T he  E m p e r or  of  Austria  is  t h e r e by  entitled  to  m a r ch  a ny  n u m b er 
of  t r o o ps  into  Wallachia,  without  a  previous  declaration  of  w ar  on  his  part 
against  Russia.  T h us  a  Turkish  d e p e n d e n cy  is  subjected  to  an  operation 
converting  it  into  a  neutral  possession  u n d er  A u s t r ia  against  T u r k e y.  By  the 
second  article  it  is  agreed  that  "it  shall  belong  exclusively  to  the  Imperial 
commander-in-chief  to  direct t he  operations  of  his  a r m y.  He  shall,  h o w e v e r, 
be  careful  to  inform  in  proper  time  the  commander-in-chief  of  t he  O t t o m an 
armies  of  his  o p e r a t i o n s ."  By  this  agreement  t he  A u s t r i a ns  e s c a pe  not  only 
from  all  control,  on  t he  p a rt  of  T u r k e y,  over  a ny  m o v e m e nt  t h ey  m ay  think 
fit,  b ut  obtain  a  perfect  control  of  all  t he  operations  possibly  intended  on 
Wallachian  ground  by  the  Turkish  c o m m a n d e r,  w h om  t h ey  h a ve  only  to 
inform  t h at  t h ey  w a nt  to  o c c u py  such  and  such  a point,  w h en t he  T u r ks  will 
be  p r e v e n t ed from  marching t h e r e.  Considering,  n o w,  t h at t he  Principalities, 
b e s i d es  t he  n a r r ow  territory  of  the  Dobrodja,  a re  t he  only  possible  battle 
field  b e t w e en  the  T u r ks  and  the  R u s s i a n s,  the  A u s t r i an  intervention  simply 
forbids  T u r k ey  to  follow  up  her  victories  a nd  p u n i sh  t he  invader. 

By  virtue  of  Article  3,  " t he  E m p e r or  of  Austria  engages  to  reestablish,  in 
c o m m on  a c c o rd  with  t he  O t t o m an  G o v e r n m e n t,  in t he  Principalities,  as soon

as  possible,  the 
secured  by  t he  Sublime  P o r te  relative  to  t he  g o v e r n m e nt  of t h e se  countries. 
T he  local  authorities  thus  reconstituted  c a n n o t,  h o w e v e r,  e x t e nd  their  action 
so  far  as  to  exercise  any  control  over  the  Imperial  a r m y ."  T h us  t he  E m p e r or

the  object  of  a  special  a r r a n g e m e nt  with  t he  Sublime  P o r t e ."  By t he  former 
of  t h e se  articles  Austria  r e s e r v es  to  herself  t he  right  to  an  arrangement  with 
R u s s ia  based  simply  on  t he  status  quo,  as  e m b o d i ed  in  the  V i e n na  n o t e.  By 
t he  latter  Austria  promises  not  to  w i t h d r aw  her t r o o ps  after  an  a r r a n g e m e nt 
b e t w e en  herself  and  Russia, b ut only  after the conclusion of  a treaty b e t w e en 
Russia  a nd  T u r k e y.  T he  "material  g u a r a n t y ,"  no  longer  safe  in  t he  direct 
keeping  of  Russia,  is  transferred  to  Austria,  a nd  A u s t r ia e m p o w e r ed  to  hold 
it  for  her—with  t he  c o n s e nt  of  t he  Porte—until  T u r k ey  shall  h a ve  a d h e r ed  to 
the  " a c c o m m o d a t i on  b e t w e en  t he  t wo  Imperial  C o u r t s ."  Article  6  entitles 
t he  Austrians  to  feed,  without  e v en  a  s e m b l a n ce  of  p a y m e n t,  u p on  t he 
remainder  left  by  t he  R u s s i a ns  in  t he  Principalities.  T he  advantages  of  this 
a r r a n g e m e nt  can  only  be  appreciated  in  G e r m a n y,  w h e re t he  people  are  w o nt 
to  receive  Austrian  garrisons  for  the  p u n i s h m e nt of  their  revolutionary  sins, 
and  w h e re  t h ey  grazed  off  whole  districts  in  1849-50. 

T he  t r e a ty  is  a  virtual  surrender  of  t he  Principalities  to  Austria,  and  an 
a b a n d o n m e nt  of  t he  T u r k i sh  suzerainty  over  t h e m.  T he  T u r ks  h a ve  c o m 
mitted  t h e r e by  as  flagrant  a  violation  of  t he  rights  of  t he  Moldo-Wallachian 
people  as  any  previously  c o m m i t t ed  by  the  Russians.  T he T u r ks  h a ve as little 
right  to  surrender  the  Principalities  to  A u s t r i an  o c c u p a t i on  as  t h ey  h a ve  to 
declare  t h em  Russian  provinces. 

T he  claims  of  the  Porte  to  the  suzerainty  of  Moldo-Wallachia  are  founded 
on t he  treaties  of  1393,1460 a nd  1511.  T he t r e a ty  concluded  in  1393  b e t w e en 
Wallachia  and  T u r k ey  contains  the  following  articles: 

" A r t.  I.  W e,  Bajazet,  e t c.  d e t e r m i n e,  by  o ur  e x t r e me  c o n d e s c e n d e n ce 
t o w a rd  Wallachia,  which  has  m a de  its  submission  to  o ur  invincible  E m p i r e, 
with  its  reigning  Prince,  t h at  t h at  c o u n t ry  is  to  continue  to  govern  itself  by 
its  o wn  laws,  and  that  t he  Prince  of  Wallachia  shall  h a ve  t he  entire  liberty 
of  declaring  w ar  or  making  p e a ce  with  his  neighbors,  h ow  and  w h en  it  m ay

Art. III.  T he  Princes  (Christians)  will  be  elected  by the Metropolitans  and

Art.  I V.  T he  Prince  of  Wallachia  will  h a ve  to  p ay  annually to  our  Imperial 

T r e a s u ry  500  piasters  of  our  m o n e y ." 

T he  treaty  concluded  in  1460  b e t w e en  Vlad  V,  Prince  of  Wallachia,  a nd 

35  M a h o m ed  II  stipulates: 

" A r t. I.  T he  Sultan  c o n s e n ts  and  engages,  for  himself  and  s u c c e s s o r s,  to

anything  b ut  t he  suzerainty  over  this  sovereign  Principality,  of  which  t he 
V o y v o d es  will  be  e x p e c t ed 
to  t he  Sublime  Porte  a  tribute  of 
10,000  d u c a t s.

Art. II.  T he  Sublime  P o r te  will  in  no  w ay  interfere  in  the  local  ad-

ministration  of  t he  said  Principality,  and  no  T u rk  will  be  allowed  to  c o me 
into  Wallachia  without  an  ostensible  m o t i v e. 

Art.  III.  T he  V o y v o d es  will  continue  to  be  elected  by  t he  Metropolitan 
A r c h b i s h o p,  the  Bishops  and  B o y a r d s,  and  the  election  will  be  recognized 
by  t he  P o r t e. 

A r t. I V.  T he  Wallachian  nation  will  continue  to  enjoy  the  free  excercise 
of  its  o wn  laws,  and  t he  V o y v o d es  will  h a ve  t he  right  of  life  and  d e a th  over 
their  subjects,  as  also  t h at  of  making  p e a ce  or  w a r,  w i t h o ut being  subjected 
for  any  of  their  acts  to  any  kind  of  responsibility  t o w a rd  t he  Sublime 
P o r t e ." 

T he  third  treaty  is  that  of  1511,  in  which  M o l d a v ia  acknowledged  the 
suzerainty  of  t he  P o r t e,  obtaining  e v en  better  conditions  in  e x c h a n ge  t h an 
Wallachia  had  obtained. 

T he  treaties  w h i ch  intervened  b e t w e en  R u s s ia  and  T u r k ey  could  not  of 
c o u r se  invalidate  the  treaties  concluded  by  the  Moldo-Wallachians  t h e m- 
selves  with  the  P o r t e,  since  this  people  never  t r e a t ed  with  the  R u s s i a ns  nor 
g a ve  t he  P o r te  p o w er  to  treat  for t h e m.  It  may  be  stated,  b e s i d e s,  t h at R u s s ia 
herself  recognized  the  above-mentioned  capitulations  in  the  treaty  of  Adria 
nople,  art. V  of  which  s a y s:  " T he  Principalities  of  Wallachia  and  Moldavia, 
having placed themselves by capitulation u n d er t he  suzerainty of the  Sublime 
P o r t e,  and  Russia  having  w a r r a n t ed  their  prosperity,  (!)  it  is  u n d e r s t o od  t h at 
t h ey  continue  to  enjoy  all  t h o se  privileges  a nd  immunities  w h i ch  h a ve  b e en 
granted  to  t h em  in  virtue  of  their  capitulation."

25 

It follows, t h e n, from t he  above-cited capitulations,  which,  not having b e en 
s u p e r s e d ed by  any  subsequent treaty, still r e m a in in vigor, t h at the Principali- 
ties  form  t wo  sovereign  States  u n d er  t he  suzerainty  of  t he  P o r t e,  to  which 
t h ey  p ay  a  tribute  on  the  condition  that  the  P o r te  shall  defend  t h em  against 
e v e ry  a nd  a ny  external  e n e m y,  and  not  interfere  at  all  in  their  internal 
administration.  So  far  from  being  entitled  to  s u r r e n d er  Wallachia  to  foreign 
occupation,  the  T u r ks  themselves  are  forbidden  from  entering  Wallachia 
w i t h o ut  an ostensible  m o t i v e.  N a y,  m o r e:  Since  the  T u r ks  h a ve t h us  violated 
their  capitulations  with  the  Wallachians  a nd  forfeited  t he  claims  of  suze 
rainty,  t he  Russians  might  e v e n,  w h en  appealed  to  by  the  Wallachians, found 
their  right  of  driving  t he  Austrians  out  of  t he  Principalities  on  t he  show  of 
b r o k en  treaties.  A nd  this  would  be  by  no  m e a ns  surprising,  as  it  has  b e en  35 
t he  c o n s t a nt  policy  of  Russia  to  encourage,  a nd  e v en  oblige  t he  T u r ks  to 
violate  t he  rights  of  the  Wallachians,  so  as  to  p r o d u ce  hostilities  b e t w e en 
t h e m,  and  create  for  herself  a  p r e t e xt  for  intervention.  W h at  h a p p e n e d,  for

this  act  furnished  the  Russians  with a p r e t e xt to  c r o ss  the frontier, on J u ne 25, 
a nd  to  m a r ch  u p on  Jassy.  Simultaneously  the  h o s p o d ar  of  Wallachia,  like 
the  other  continental  g o v e r n m e n t s,  granted  a  n u m b er  of  reforms  d e m a n d ed 
by  t he  Liberal  party  of  t he  Wallachian  B o y a r d s.  This  w as  on J u ne  23.  It  is 
scarcely  n e c e s s a ry  to  r e m a rk  that  t h e se  r e f o r ms  infringed  in  no  w ay  u p on

A b o ut  eighty  y e a rs  ago  w h en  the  victorious  armies  of  Catherine  II.  w e re 
severing  from  T u r k ey  province  after  province,  prior  to  their  transformation 
into  w h at is  n ow  called  S o u th Russia, the p o et D e r z h a v i n, in o ne of the bursts 
of lyrical  enthusiasm in which he w as  w o nt to  celebrate  the  glories,  if n ot t he 
virtues  of  that  E m p r e s s,  and  the  destined  g r a n d e ur  of  h er  e m p i r e,  u t t e r ed 
a  m e m o r a b le  couplet  in  which  we  m ay  still  find  c o n d e n s ed  t he  scornful 
b o l d n e ss  and  self-reliance  of  the  Czarian  policy: 

" A nd  w h at  to  t h e e,  O  R u s s,  is  any  ally? 
A d v a n ce  and  the  whole  U n i v e r se  is  t h i n e !" 

T h is  m ay  be  true  enough,  e v en  n o w,  if  the  R u ss  only  could  a d v a n c e,  b ut 
on  t h at  p r o c e ss  a  p r e t ty  decided  c h e ck  h as  b e en  p u t.  C o n s e q u e n t ly  he  is 
constrained  for  t he  p r e s e nt  m o m e nt  at  least,  to  p o s t p o ne  the  p o s s e s s i on  of 
t he  U n i v e r s e.  B ut  w h at is  very  bitter  to  his  pride  is  t h at in  retracing  his  steps 
he  n ot  only  fails  to  carry  with  him  the  pledge  of  universal  dominion,  b ut  is 
e v en  obliged  to  leave  behind  t he  keys  of  the  simple  fortress  of  Silistria,  on 
the  D a n u b e,  which  he  had  sworn  to  h a v e.  And  still  m o re  painful,  he  leaves 
b e h i nd  him  also  t he  remains  of  s o me fifty  t h o u s a nd of  his  b r e t h r e n,  w ho  h a ve 
perished  by  disease  and  battle  in  this  single  campaign. 

T h e re  is  no  d o u bt  t h at  in  a  military  point  of  view  t he  siege  of  Silistria  is 
t he  m o st  i m p o r t a nt  a m o ng  all  the  military  e v e n ts  since  t he  beginning  of  t he 
w a r.  It  is  the  failure  to  take  that fortress which  r e n d e rs  t he  campaign a failure 
for  t he  Russians  and  adds  disgrace  and  t he  C z a r 's  disfavor  to  t he  retreat 
behind  the  Sereth,  in  w h i ch  t h ey  are  now  engaged.  Of  the  earlier  stages  of

w h i ch  are  distinct,  clear  and  business-like  in  w h at  t h ey  state,  b ut  a b o u nd  in 
faults  of  omission,  we  n ow  h a ve  L i e u t e n a nt  N a s m y t h 's  (Bengal  Artillery,) 
r e p o rt  to  The  London  Times,  a  c o m p l e te  j o u r n al  of  t he  siege,  giving  s o me 
interesting  particulars,  b ut m a de  up  in  r a t h er  a  slovenly w a y,  and  sometimes 
incorrect  in  t he  dates.  It is  only  p r o p er to  say t h at t he views  a nd conclusions 
we  h a ve  previously  e x p r e s s ed  concerning t he  siege, are  altogether confirmed 
by  t h e se  later  and  m o re  detailed  narratives,  e x c e pt  in  t he  particular t h at t he 
T u r ks  did  n ot  a b a n d on  the  defense  of  the  fort  A r ab  Tabiassi  a s,  in t he  latter 
part  of  the  siege,  we  supposed  t h ey  would  be  c o n s t r a i n ed  to  d o.  It  a p p e a rs 

t o o,  that  t he  Russians  w e re  still  m o re  e x t r a v a g a nt  in  their  operations  t h an 
we  suspected.  First  t h ey  m a de  a  regular  a t t a ck on t he  fortress  on its  e a s t e rn 
side,  on  the  low  lands  of  the  D a n u b e,  hoping  to  be  able  to  t u rn the  d e t a c h ed 
forts  altogether  and  to  m a ke  a  b r e a ch  in  t he  main  wall  of  Silistria  at  o n c e. 
If  this  a t t e m pt had  the  merit of  originality, it certainly  had  no  other.  It affords, 
p e r h a p s,  the  first  instance  of  t r e n c h es  a nd  a p p r o a c h es  being  t h r o wn  up 
against  a  fortress,  on  ground  w h i ch  w as  n ot  only  flanked,  b ut  actually  c o m 
m a n d ed  in  t he  rear  by  hights  fortified  by  t he  e n e m y.  B ut  t h en  a  second,  an 
irregular  attack  w as  directed  against  t h e se  v e ry  hights,  and  so  cleverly 
combined,  t h at  after  t he  loss  of  a  fortnight  on  reconnoitering  and  storming, 
in  which  t h o u s a n ds  of  Russians  w e re  killed  or  disabled;  a  regular  siege 
against  t h em  h ad  also  to  be  e m p l o y e d.  So  m u ch  for  t he  skill  displayed  by 
t he  R u s s i a n s.  L et  us  n ow  p a ss  to  the  details  of  the  period  of  the  siege.

On  the  1st  of  J u ne  the  Russians  got  a fresh train  of  siege-artillery,  b r o u g ht 
over  from  t he  left  b a nk  of the  D a n u b e,  which t h ey  arranged in b a t t e ry  against 
25  A r ab  Tabiassi.  T he  T u r ks  sank  shafts  and  p u s h ed  mines  u n d er  the  counter 
scarps  and  glacis  of  this  fort.  On J u ne 2,  M u s sa P a s h a, c o m m a n d er of Silistria 
w as  killed  by  a  shell.  T o w a rd  evening  t he  R u s s i a ns  exploded  a  mine  u n d er 
o ne  of  the  bastions  of  A r ab  Tabiassi.  As  at  that  time  t h ey  could  not  yet  h a ve 
arrived  at  the  c r e st  of  the  glacis,  this  mine  could  not  h a ve  b e en  very  a c-
curately  laid.  T he  distances,  as  well  as  t he  line  of  shortest  resistance,  m u st 
h a ve  b e en  wrongly  calculated,  and,  accordingly,  w h en  the  mine  sprung,  so 
far  from  injuring  t he  T u r k i sh  defenses,  it  exploded  b a c k w a rd  and  over 
w h e l m ed  the  Russian  t r e n c h es  with  a  hail  of  stones  and  earth.  But  here  t he 
storming  columns  w e re  assembled  r e a dy  for  an  assault,  and  t he  effect of this 
hail  of  stones  a m o ng  t h em  m ay  be  readily  imagined.  H ow  far  the  R u s s i a ns 
s u c c e e d ed  in  effectually  blockading  t he  fortress,  is  s h o wn  by  the  fact  t h at 
on  this  day  5,000  Turkish  irregulars  from  R a s g r ad  w e st of  Silistria m a de  their 
w ay  into  t he  besieged  t o w n.

F r om  the  4th  to  the  8th  of  J u ne t he t r e n c h es  against the A r ab Tabiassi w e re 
continued.  T he  Russians  arrived  at  t he  glacis,  [and]  p u s h ed  a  sap  boldly

p u s h ed  it  u n d er  t he  scarp  of  the  bastion.  While  this  w as  going  on  M a r s h al 
P a s h k i e w i t ch  on t he  9th  again  m a de  o ne of his  inexplicable  displays  of  a r m ed 
force  in  a  grand  r e c o n n o i s s a n ce  against  the  fortress,  consisting  of  31  battal

only  in  t he  h o pe  of  some  c h a n ce  offering itself for  doing  something  serious, 
or  at  least  to  impress  your  e n e my  with  the  notion  t h at  y ou  are  irresistible. 
B ut  no  such  effect  w as  produced  u p on t he  T u r k s.  On t he  c o n t r a r y,  t h ey  sent 
forth  4,000  cavalry,  w h o,  according  to  the  R u s s i an  bulletin  w e re  dreadfully

t a k en  in  the  affray.  At  the  same  time, Pashkiewitch instead of  reconnoitering 
something  to  his  advantage,  w a s,  according  to  t he  r e p o r t,  himself  r e c o n-
noitered  by  a  T u r k i sh  cannon-ball,  which p ut  him  hors  de  combat and  n e c e s 
sitated  his  being  t r a n s p o r t ed  to  Jassy.

On t he  10th t he  siege  w as  at its  crisis. T he g r a nd m i n e,  Schilder's last h o p e, 
w as  sprung.  It  p r o d u c ed  indeed  a  practicable  b r e a ch  in  the  front  bastion  of 
A r ab  Tabiassi.  T he  Russian  columns  a d v a n c ed  to  t he  assault;  but,  as  t h ey 
might  h a ve  e x p e c t e d,  t he  T u r ks  had  long  since  m a de  a  coupure  or  s e c o nd 
p a r a p et  with  a  ditch,  a  little  to  the  rear  of  the  main  wall,  and  the  Russians 
on  coming  up  found  themselves  arrested  and  e x p o s ed  to  m u r d e r o us  fire. 
N o w,  w h en  the  a d v a n ce  on  an  assaulting  c o l u mn  is  o n ce  b r o u g ht to  a  stand, 
that  c o l u mn  is  b e a t e n;  for  the  fire  of  the  e n e my  c o v e r ed  behind  ramparts 
and  supported  by  artillery,  at  a  distance  w h e re  e v e ry  s h ot tells,  forces  it  to 
r e t r e at in  a  v e ry  few  minutes.  T he  Russians, t h e r e f o r e, h ad to  m a ke  the b e st 
of  the  w ay  b a ck  across  the  b r e a c h,  and  w e re  followed  by  the  T u r k s,  w ho 
p u r s u ed  t h em  as  far  as  t he  Russian  t r e n c h es  a nd  d e s t r o y ed  p a rt of  t he  siege 
w o r k s.  This  assault  w as  the  last  serious  enterprise  of  t he  R u s s i a ns  against 
Silistria.  If  t he  siege  w as  apparently  a nd  nominally  c o n t i n u ed  until  o r d e rs 
for  the  raising  of  it  arrived,  it  w as  merely  to  save  a p p e a r a n c e s.  On  t he  12th 
t he  b l o c k a de  w as  so  little  sustained  t h at  E u r o p e an  officers  from  Shumla  h ad 
no  difficulty  in  entering  the  fortress.

T he  Russians  had  o p e n ed  their  t r e n c h es  in  the  low  ground  on  the  19th  of

at  the  foot  of  the  glacis.  Neither  was  t he  glacis  c r o w n e d,  n or  w e re  trenching 
batteries  e r e c t e d;  b u t,  as  before  stated,  a  sap  w as  p u s h ed  up  the  slope  of  the 
glacis,  in  o r d er  to  sink  t he  shaft  of  t he  mine  at  its  t o p.  As  we  learn  from  all

proportions  b ut  little  p e r m a n e nt  strength,  t he  c o n d u ct  of  its  defenders, 
c o m p o s ed  of  four  battalions  and  500  irregulars  u n d er  H u s s e in  P a s h a,  cer 
tainly  deserves  the  highest  praise.  N i ne  d a ys  of  distant  cannonading,  eleven 
d a ys  of  o p en  t r e n c h e s,  t wo  mines  and  four  or  five  assaults,  all  ending in t he 
discomfiture  of  t he  e n e m y,  we  r e m e m b er  no  other  instance  in  t he  history 
of  w ar  w h e re  a  m e re  o u t w o r k,  of  such  c o n s t r u c t i on  as  A r ab  Tabiassi,  h as 
stood  so  much.  T he  instances  coming  n e a r e st to  it  are  t he defense of  Colberg 
by  t he  Prussians  in  1807,  and  of  Danzig  by  the  F r e n ch  in  1813. 

It  has  seemed  v e ry  surprising  t h at  during the w h o le  siege nothing w as  d o ne 
by  O m er  P a s ha  to  support  or  relieve  so  i m p o r t a nt  a  place.  F r om  his  letter 
a d d r e s s ed  to  Sami  P a s h a,  the  G o v e r n or  of  Widdin,  we  learn,  h o w e v e r,  t h at 
he  w as  actually  preparing  to  succor  Silistria  w h en t he  R u s s i a ns  withdrew  to 
the  left  side of the D a n u b e.  " Y ou k n o w ,"  says  this letter,  " t h at I had collected 
all  o ur  forces  in  front  of  Shumla,  and  t h at  I  w as  preparing  to  m a r ch  to  t he 
relief  of  the  place.  Six  regiments  of  cavalry  a nd  t h r ee  batteries  had  already 
left  S h u m la  for  this  destination.  T he  R u s s i a n s,  having gained information  of 
this  m o v e m e n t,  h a ve  w i t h d r a wn  precipitately  o v er  to  the  left b a n k,  with  the 
whole  of  their  artillery.  During  the  forty  d a ys  t h ey  invested  the  place,  the 
Russians  lost  25,000  m en  killed." 

W h at  the  Russians  are  n ow  a b o ut  to  do  it  is  impossible  to  decide.  A c-
cording  to  s o me  V i e n na  p a p e r s,  t h ey  p u r p o se  to  t a ke  up  a  position  behind 
the  B u s e o,  b ut  the  same  p a p e rs  p r e t e nd  t h at  it  is  the  fear  of  Austria  which 
drives  t h em  b a c k,  and  t he  B u s eo  is  equally  outflanked  by  Austria.  If  t he 
Russians  t ry  to  hold  Moldavia,  they  w o u ld  be  outflanked  by  Austria  from 
Galicia  and  t he  Bukovina.  B ut  a  timely  j u n c t i on  of  t he  Russian  t r o o ps  in

T he  n e ws  we  receive  of  the  military  insurrection  at  Madrid  continues  to  be 
of  a  v e ry  contradictory  and  fragmentary  c h a r a c t e r.  All  t he  Madrid  tele-

In Italy,  a  strange  excitement has  t a k en  hold  b o th of  t he  G o v e r n m e n ts a nd

b r e a k i ng  o ut  of  an  insurrection  in  Servia.  T he  first  is  a b s u r d,  as  t he  t h e a t er 
of  w ar  is  too  distant  from  Servia,  and  should  t he  R u s s i a ns  a t t e m pt to  enter 
it,  the  Servian  and  T u r k i sh  t r o o ps  would  perfectly  suffice  to  repel  t h e m.  If 
auxiliary  t r o o ps  w e re  required,  others  would  be  preferable to  Austrian.  " T he 
S e r v i an  nation  h as  so  decided  a  mistrust,  if  not  a h a t r e d,  of  Austria,  t h at the 
e n t r a n ce  of  the  Austrians  into  Servia  would  be  immediately  considered  by

proceedings  of  the  Servians  w o u ld  be  directed  against  t he  A u s t r i an  t r o o p s, 
all  t he  energy  of  t he  nation  would  be  e m p l o y ed  in  resisting  t h o se  enemies 
in  w h om  is  always  supposed  to  be  personified  t h at  cupidity  w h i ch  urges 
A u s t r ia  to  seek  to  exercise  in  Servia,  no  matter  u n d er  w h at  p a t r o n a g e,  a 
selfish  influence."  As  to  internal  insurrections,  t h ey  are  only  to  be  ap- 
p r e h e n d ed  in  c o n s e q u e n ce  of  Austrian  intervention.  Servia  will  always  be 
loyal  to  the  P o r t e.  "All  that  the  Servian  G o v e r n m e nt  r e q u i r e s,  is  to  be 
h o n o r ed  h e n c e f o r th  with t he  same  confidence t he  Sublime  P o r te h as  hitherto

w o u ld  be t he  signal  for,  and t he c o m m e n c e m e nt of, incalculable misfortunes. 
On  this  condition,  t he  Servian  G o v e r n m e nt  fully  a n s w e rs  for  the  main 
t e n a n ce  of public tranquillity, of order in S e r v i a ." T h is p r o t e st of t he  Servians 
is  at  t he  s a me  time  a  fair  indication  with  w h at  e n t h u s i a sm  the  Austrian

surrections,  and  t h e se  invariably  dragging  municipal  p r o n u n c i a m e n t os  in 
their  train.  T h e re  are  t wo  c a u s es  for  this  p h e n o m e n o n.  In  t he  first  place,  we 
find  t h at  w h at  we  call  the  State  in  a  m o d e rn  sense  h a s,  from  the  exclusively 
provincial  life  of  t he  people,  no  national  e m b o d i m e nt  in  opposition  to  t he 
C o u r t,  e x c e pt in the  army.  In the  second p l a c e, t he peculiar position of Spain

tinuing  to  uphold  t he  c a u se  of  t he  nation,  w as  c h a n g ed  into  an instrument for 
t he  rivalries  of  t he  ambitious  p r e t e n d e rs  to  t he  military  guardianship  of  t he 
C o u r t.  C o n s e q u e n t l y, we  find  the  m o v e m e nt of  1854 v e ry  different e v en from 
t h at  of  1843.  T he  émeute  of  Gen.  O'Donnell  w as  l o o k ed  u p on  by  t he  people 
as  anything  b ut  a  conspiracy  against  the  leading  influence  at  t he  Court, 
especially  as  it  w as  supported  by  t he  ex-favorite  Serrano.  T he  t o w ns  a nd 
c o u n t ry  accordingly  d e m u r r ed  to  giving  any  r e s p o n se  to  the  appeal  m a de  by 
t he  cavalry  of  Madrid.  It  was  t h us  t h at  Gen.  O'Donnell  w as  forced  to  alter 
entirely  the  c h a r a c t er  of  his  o p e r a t i o n s,  in  o r d er  n ot  to  r e m a in  isolated  and 
e x p o s ed  to  failure.  He  w as  forced  to  insert  in  his  proclamation  t h r ee  points 
equally  o p p o s ed  to  the  s u p r e m a cy  of  the  a r m y:  the  c o n v o c a t i on  of  the 
C o r t e s,  an  economical  G o v e r n m e n t,  and  the  formation of  a  national  militia— 
the  last  d e m a nd  originating  in  the  desire  of  the  t o w ns  to  recover  their  inde 
p e n d e n ce  of  the  a r m y.  It  is  a  fact,  t h e n,  t h at  t he  military  insurrection  has 
obtained  the  support  of  a  popular  insurrection  only  by  submitting  to  the 
conditions  of  the  latter.  It  r e m a i ns  to  be  seen  w h e t h er  it  will  be  constrained 
to  adhere  to  t h em  and  to  e x e c u te  t h e se  p r o m i s e s. 

With  the  e x c e p t i on of  the  Carlists,  all parties h a ve raised their cry—Progre 
sistas,  partisans  of  t he  Constitution  of  1837,  partisans  of t he  Constitution of 
1812,  U n i o n i s t s,  (demanding  t he  a n n e x a t i on  of  Portugal,)  a nd  R e p u b l i c a n s. 
T he  n e ws  concerning  t he  latter  p a r ty  is  to  be  received  with  caution,  since 
it  h as  to  p a ss  the  c e n s u re  of  the  Paris  police.  Beside  t h e se  party  struggles, 
the  rival  pretensions  of  the  military  l e a d e rs  are  in  full  development.  E s p a r 
tero  h ad  no  sooner  heard  of  the  success  of  O'Donnell  t h an  he  left his  r e t r e at 
at  L e g a n es  and  declared  himself  t he  chief  of  t he  m o v e m e n t.  B ut  as  soon  as 
C a e s ar  N a r v a ez  learned  the  a p p e a r a n ce  of  his  old  P o m p ey  in  the  field,  he 
forthwith  offered  his  services  to  t he  Q u e e n,  w h i ch  w e re  a c c e p t e d,  and  he 
is  to  form  a  new  Ministry.  F r om  the  details  I  am  a b o ut  to  give  y o u,  it  will 
be  s e en  t h at  the  military  has  by  no  m e a ns  t a k en  t he  initiative  in  all  places, 
but  t h at  in  s o me  t h ey  h a ve  h ad  to  yield  to  the  o v e r p o w e r i ng  p r e s s u re  of t he 
population. 

Besides  t he  p r o n u n c i a m e n t os  in  Valencia,  r e p o r t ed  in  my  last,  t h e re  has

F r om  Our  O wn  C o r r e s p o n d e n t. 

L o n d o n,  T u e s d a y,  July  25,  1854. 

At  last  T h u r s d a y 's  evening  sitting  of  the  H o u se  of  C o m m o n s,  in  reply  to  an 
inquiry  of  Mr. Disraeli,  L o rd  J. Russell  stated  t h at  h er  Majesty  h ad  b e en 
pleased  to  order  that  a  m e s s a ge  should  be  sent  to  the  H o u s e,  in  p u r s u a n ce 
of  which  he  p r o p o s ed  to  m o ve  on  M o n d ay  a  v o te  of  credit  for  £3,000,000. 
T h e re  w o u ld  be  no  necessity  for  a  C o m m i t t ee  of  W a ys  a nd  M e a n s.  To 
Mr. Disraeli's  question w h e t h er t h e re w o u ld be  an a u t u m n al  session this y e a r, 
L o rd  J o hn  gave  no  reply.  Accordingly  the  v o te  of  credit w as  accomplished 
w i t h o ut  a  division,  in t he  sitting  of  b o th  H o u s es  w h i ch t o ok p l a ce  y e s t e r d a y. 
In  t he  H o u se  of  L o r d s,  L o rd  A b e r d e e n,  in  moving  the  v o t e,  delivered  the 
shortest,  dryest,  a nd  m o st  common-place  s p e e ch  t h at  e v er  he  h as  favored 
us  w i th  since  his  accession  to  the  Premiership.  He  h ad  to  a sk  for  t h r ee 
millions, and he w as sure their lordships w o u ld h a ve no objection. T h ey might 
entertain  different  opinions,  b ut  all  of  t h em  m u st  be  u n a n i m o us  as  " to  the 
necessity  of  adopting  all  such  m e a s u r es  as  w e re  b e st  calculated  to  lead  to 
an  early  and  successful  termination  of  the  w a r ."  This  result  w as  mainly  to 
be p r o d u c ed  " by t he  activity  a nd energy of t he  efforts  of E n g l a nd  a nd F r a n c e, 
with  t he  c o n c u r r e n ce  of  the  other  p o w e r s ."  He  did  n ot  say w h e t h er he m e a nt

" t he  other p o w e r s" with w h om England and  F r a n ce  are to  c o n c u r.  Parliament

G o v e r n m e nt  w i th  m o n e y.  Possibly  some  noble  lords  might  prefer  to  see  the 
m o n ey  intrusted  to  other  h a n ds  t h an  his,  b ut  s u ch  fanciful  w i s h es  ought  n ot

T he  E a rl  of  Ellenborough,  w ho  has  the  particular  gift  of  n e v er  speaking  to

T he  E a rl  of  H a r d w i c ke  saw  a  v e ry  great  force  in  the  Baltic  r e a dy  for  any 
e m e r g e n c y,  a  similar  force  in  the  Black  Sea,  a nd  the  greatest  a r my  sent  o ut 
that  e v er  left  this  country.  He  did  n ot  k n ow  w h at  the  G o v e r n m e nt  intended 
to  do  with  t h e m,  and,  therefore,  he  appealed  to  e v e ry  noble  lord to  grant t he

E a rl  Fitz-William,  an  out-of-place  Whig,  p r o t e s t ed  against  "this  c o u n t ry 
being  described  as  being t he  highest t a x ed in E u r o pe ; it ought to be  described 
as  t h at  in  which  the  t a x es  fall  m o re  lightly  on  the  people  t h an  in  a ny  other 
section  of  t he  E u r o p e an  c o m m o n w e a l t h ."  If  the  noble lord h ad s p o k en of t he 
lords  instead  of  the  people,  he  w o u ld  h a ve  b e en  right.  " As  to  the  s p e e ch  of

k n ow  b e t t er  w h at  t he  w a n ts  of  t he  H o u se  are  in  r e s p e ct  to  ideas.  E a rl  Fitz-
William  desired  to  learn  from  L o rd  A b e r d e en  w ho  w e re  " t he  other  p o w e r s ," 
20  w h o se c o n c u r r e n ce he w as  anxious to h a v e? P e r h a ps A u s t r i a? He feared t h ey 
might  be  induced  by  t h at  p o w er  to  consider  certain  minor  o b j e c t s,  as  t he 
evacuation  of  the  Principalities,  a nd  the  free  navigation  of  the  D a n u b e,  as 
justifying  t h em  in  concluding  p e a c e.  (Ridiculous  fear,  since  L o rd  A b e r d e en 
will  certainly  not  be  induced  by  any  o ne  to  d e m a nd  so  m u c h .)  He  w a n t ed 
also  to  k n ow w h at w as  to be u n d e r s t o od by the  integrity  of Turkey—whether 
it  w as  t h at  circumscribed  by  the  t r e a ty  of  Adrianople,  or  something  else? 
Finally,  he  considered  t h at  t h ey  found  t h e m s e l v es  in  a  v e ry  singular  posi 
tion,  Parliament  having  no  information  w h a t e v er  of  the  intentions  of  the

of  hurrying  into  the  field  held  b a ck  and  c o m m e n c ed  fresh  negotiations?  He

In  Order  to  p r o ve  that  Austria  " o u g h t"  to  be  t he  b e st  possible  ally,  L o rd

administration  of  t he  Foreign  Office,  their  lordships  w e re  satisfied  to  d r aw 
the  m o st  cheering  conclusions.  Having  twice  b e en  convicted  of  the  m o st

his  a s s u r a n ce  " t h at  t h e re  is  no  intention  of  returning  to  the  status  quo,  and 
t h at  t h e re  is  no  intention  of  listening to  a p a t c h e d - up p e a c e,  which could only

W h en  the  first  extraordinary  grant  w as  a b o ut  to be  a s k e d,  the  G o v e r n m e nt

It  w as  r e s e r v ed  for  Mr. Disraeli  to  blow  up  by  o ne  single  b r e a th the  whole

during  t he  last  autumnal  vacation,  he  confessed  himself  to  be  surprised, 
bewildered,  alarmed  at  the  a n n o u n c e m e nt  of  t he  impending  destruction  of 
Sevastopol  a nd  the  c o n q u e st  of  the  Crimea.  L o rd  J o hn  h e re  e x p r e s s ed  dis

L o rd  J o hn  to  an  explanation.  In  a  voice  of  humility  a nd  confusion  he  c a me 
forward,  at  last:  "I  m ay  as  well  state  t h at  w h at  I  said  w a s,  that  I  thought

In  o ne  of  my  former  letters  I  gave  y ou  an  analysis  of  the  Austro-Turkish 
T r e a ty  of  t he  14th of J u n e,  and  stated as t he  p u r p o s es  aimed  at by t h at curious 
diplomatic  transaction:  1st.  To  give  the  allied  armies  a p r e t e xt for  n ot c r o s s 
ing  t he  D a n u b e,  and  for  not  confronting  t he  R u s s i a n s;  2d.  To  p r e v e nt  the 
T u r ks  from  reoccupying  the  w h o le  of Wallachia,  and forcing t h em  o ut of t h at 
p a rt  which  t h ey  h ad  already  c o n q u e r e d;  3d.  To  r e s t o re  in  t he  Principalities 
the  old  R e a c t i o n a ry  G o v e r n m e n t,  forced  u p on  the  R o u m a ns  by  R u s s ia  in 
1848.  We  are  n ow  actually  informed  from  Constantinople,  t h at  Austria  has 
p r o t e s t ed  against  O m er  P a s h a 's  p r e s u m p t i on  in  crossing  t he  D a n u b e;  t h at 
she  claims  an  exclusive  occupation  of  t he  Principalities  for  herself,  and  t he 
right  of  shutting  t h em  n ot  only  against  the  A n g l o - F r e n ch  t r o o p s,  b ut equally 
against the T u r k s. U p on this r e m o n s t r a n c e, t he P o r te is said to h a ve f orward-
ed  o r d e rs  to  O m er  P a s ha  n ot  to  c r o ss  t he  D a n u be  for  t he  p r e s e n t,  while 
refusing  to  admit,  in  principle,  t he  exclusive  o c c u p a t i on  of  t he  Principalities 
by  Austria.  W r e t c h ed  P a s ha w ho  has  learned  something from  his  m a s t er  and 
contriver,  L o rd  Palmerston,  has  of  c o u r se  little  objection to  admitting in fact 
w h at  he  refuses  in  principle.  Y ou  m ay  p e r h a ps  think  t h at  Austria h as  already 
violated  as  well  as  practically  canceled  t he  t r e a ty  of  t he  14th  J u n e,  by  n ot 
entering  Wallachia  at  the  m o m e nt  w h en  t he  R u s s i an  a r my  w as  disorderly 
retreating  in  t h r ee  different  directions,  a nd  w as  e x p o s ed  in t he  flank and  t he 
rear  to  an  Austrian  attack,  if  it h ad  failed  to  retire  at  o n ce  behind  t he  Sereth. 
Only  r e m e m b er  t h at by  t he  v e ry  w o r ds  of this f a m o us t r e a ty  Austria is b o u nd 
neither  to  enter  the  Principalities  at  o n c e,  nor  to  leave  t h em  at  a ny  e x a ct 
e p o c h,  nor  e v en  to  force  the  Russians  to  e v a c u a te  t h em  within  any  definite 
t e r m.  It  is  now  stated  t h at  t he  Austrians  a re  really  entering  Little  Wallachia, 
a nd  t h at  t he  Russians  are  recalling  their  t r o o ps  from  t he  Carpathian  p a s s es 
and  concentrating  t h em  at  F o k s h a n i.  T h i s,  h o w e v e r,  m e a ns  nothing but  t h at

t he  Austrians,  instead  of  expelling  t he  Russians  from  G r e at  Wallachia,  h a ve 
resolved  to  eject  t he  T u r ks  from  Little  Wallachia,  t h us  preventing  their 
o p e r a t i o ns  on  t he  b a n ks  of  t he  Aluta.  It is  evident t h at  no  b e t t er  contrivance

their  exclusion  from  the  territory  c o n q u e r ed  by  t he  T u r k i sh  a r m y,  a nd  by

t he  h o s p o d a rs  had  n ot  failed  in  their  duty  as  loyal  subjects.  T he  P o r te  had

Stirbey,  the  h o s p o d ar  of  Wallachia,  h ad  b e en  v e ry  c o m p r o m i s i n g,  having

provisionally,  while  t he  Porte  would  appoint  a  High  C o m m i s s i o n er  to  inquire

at  o n ce  u n d e r s t o od  t h at  Prince  Ghika,  against w h om Reshid p r e t e n ds  to h a ve

itself,  and  stigmatized  as  a  Russian  agent,  is,  on  t he  c o n t r a r y,  a real  restora

this  b u b b le  s p e e ch  suddenly  shrunk  together,  a nd  t he  false  lion  was  forced

t he  motion  of  Dudley  negatived  without  a  division.  T he  Ministry  contrived 
to  t u rn  their  v e ry  disgrace  into  a  victory  over  the  C o m m o n e r s.  This  w as  the

give  any  further  explanation  of  the  statements  w h i ch  he  m a de  last  night." 
35  As  to  t he  "painful  distinctions"  w h i ch certain parties  h ad a t t e m p t ed to  d r aw

Being  p r e s e nt  at  the  sittings  of  the  English  Parliament  on  M o n d ay  and

That  Bore  of  a  War. 

It  is  n ow  v e ry n e ar  a t w e l v e m o n th  since  a small T u r k i sh c o r p s, t wo  battalions, 
s u c c e e d ed  in  crossing  t he  D a n u be  near  T u r t u k a i,  o p p o s i te  Oltenitza,  t h r ew 
up  i n t r e n c h m e n ts  t h e r e,  and  being  attacked  by  the  R u s s i a n s,  repulsed  t h em 
in  a  v e ry  spirited  little  affair,  which,  being  t he  first  e n g a g e m e nt  in  t he  war, 
t o ok t he  style  and  title  of  the  Battle  of  Oltenitza.  T h e re  the  T u r ks  alone w e re

as  a  r e s e r v e,  and  could  n ot  e v en  e x p e ct  any  s u p p o rt  from  the  allied  fleets. 
A nd  y et  t h ey  held  their  ground  on  the  Wallachian  side  of  t he  river  for  a 
fortnight  at  Oltenitza,  and  for  the  whole  winter  at  Kalafat. 

Since  t h e n,  England  and  F r a n ce  h a ve  declared  w ar  against R u s s i a;  sundry 
exploits  of  a  doubtful  nature  it  is  true  h a ve b e en achieved.  B l a ck S ea  fleets, 
Baltic  fleets,  and  an  a r my  of  n ow  nearly  a  h u n d r ed  t h o u s a nd  English  and 
F r e n ch  soldiers  are  t h e re  to  assist  the  T u r ks  or  to  m a ke  diversions  in  their

b u s i n e ss  on  a  larger  scale,  b ut  rather  less  successfully  t h an  last  year. 

T he  R u s s i a ns  laid  siege to  Silistria.  T h ey w e nt a b o ut it  stupidly b ut bravely. 
T h ey  w e re  defeated  day  after.day,  night  after  night;  n ot by  superior  science, 
n ot  by  Captain  Butler  or  L i e u t e n a nt  N a s m y t h,  t he  t wo  British  officers 
p r e s e nt  w h o,  according  to  The  Times,  saved  Silistria.  T h ey  w e re  defeated 
by  the  ignorance  of  the  T u r k s,  an  ignorance  extending  so  far  as  n ot  to  k n ow 
w h en  a  fort  or  r a m p a rt  c e a s es  to  be  tenable,  a nd  sticking  doggedly  to  e v e ry

defeated,  b e s i d e s,  by  t he  stolidity  of  their  o wn  G e n e r a l s,  by  fever  a nd 
c h o l e r a;  finally by  the  moral  effect of  an  allied  a r my m e n a c i ng their left,  and 
an  Austrian  a r my  menacing  their  right  wing.  W h en  t he  w ar b e g a n,  we  stated 
t h at  the  R u s s i an  a r my  h ad  never  b e en  able  to  lay  a  regular  siege,  and  the 
ill-managed  operations  before  Silistria  show  that  t h ey  h a ve  n ot  i m p r o v ed

In  M a y,  1843,  his  popularity  having  long  since  faded  away,  he  retained

helpless  hesitation,  deadly  delay,  apathetic  irresolution,  indolent  w e a k n e s s. 
While  N a r v a ez  raised  the  siege  of  Teruel,  and  m a r c h ed  into  Aragon,  E s p a r

greater  e v en  t h an  that  p r o d u c ed  by  t he  f a m o us  trial  of  Q u e en  Caroline  in

heavier  t h an  t h at  of  t he  Queen.  Afterward  he  fled  to  Portugal  to  e s c a pe  t he

o p e r a t i o n s,  with  at  least  o ne  parallel  and  b a t t e r i e s,  a nd t h e r e f o re  is  a  matter 
of  s o me  duration.  This  kind  of  questions,  h o w e v e r,  c an  only  be  decided  on 
t he  spot.  At  all  events  the  taking  of  B o m a r s u nd  will  h a v e,  in  a  military  point 
of  v i e w,  a far  higher  interest  t h an e v en the  c a p t u re  of  S e v a s t o p o l,  i n a s m u ch 
as  it  contributes  to  t he  solution of a much-discussed question, while t he latter 
feat  w o u ld  merely  be  the  successful  carrying  o ut  of  old-established  military 
rules. 

T he  p r o p o s ed  attack  u p on  Sevastopol  is  to  be  mainly  e x e c u t ed  by  land 

f o r c e s;  while  t he  action  of  t he  fleets  must be  almost entirely  confined to t he 
close  b l o c k a de  of  the  harbor.  It  thus  a m o u n ts  to  a  land  a nd  sea  blockade  of 
a  sea-port  incompletely  fortified  on  t he  land  side.  We  h a ve  no  m e a ns  of 
knowing  w h at  fortifications  m ay  h a ve  b e en  raised  by  t he  R u s s i a ns  on  the 
s o u th  of  t he  t o wn  and  bay;  but  that  they  h a ve  established r e d o u b ts  and  lines 
w h i ch  m ay  necessitate  a  regular  siege,  unless  great  sacrifices  are  submitted 
t o,  t h e re  c an  hardly  be  a  question.  At  all  e v e n t s,  we  k n ow  t h at  a  p e r m a n e nt 
and  to  all  a p p e a r a n ce  well-constructed fort—a large  square  with  ample  ditch-
defenses  on  e a ch  of  its  sides,  and  mortar-batteries  in  e a ch  of  its  salient 
angles—crowns  the  hill  on  the  north  of  the  b a y,  just opposite  the  town.  T h at 
hill  is  t he  only  position  near  the  t o wn  which  a p p e a rs  n ot  to  be  c o m m a n d ed 
within  gun-range  by  other  hights,  and  which  itself  c o m m a n ds  the  b ay  and 
its  opposite  slope.  H e r e,  then,  at  all  e v e n t s,  will  be  the  chief  r e s i s t a n c e;  b ut 
it  m ay  be  doubted  if the possession of the  t o wn and  h a r b or c an be maintained, 
e v en  if  all  coast-forts  on  t he  southern  shore  are  t a k e n,  unless  this  fort  is 
r e d u c e d.  T h e re  will  be  some  regular  siege  w o r k,  t h e r e,  at  least.  N o w,  the 
e x t e nt  of  the  b ay  from  C a pe  Constantine  to  its  h e ad is  a b o ut  eight  miles;  and 
allowing  a  m o d e r a te  range  to  the  t o wn  and  forts, t he  allied forces  w o u ld h a ve 
to  e x t e nd  on  a  semi-circle  of  t w e n t y - t wo  or twenty-four  miles  a r o u nd t h e m, 
in  order  to  insure  the  blockade  on  land.  T h ey  m u st  be  strong  e n o u gh  on  all 
points  to  resist t he  sallies  of the  garrison,  and t he a t t a c ks of a ny t r o o ps w h i ch 
might  be  collected  in  their  rear.  Although  we  h a ve  no  m e a ns  of  knowing t he 
forces  which  R u s s ia  c an  bring  directly  or  indirectly  to  t he  defense  of  her 
Black  S ea  stronghold,  yet  t h e se  details  show  that  no  inconsiderable  b o dy of 
t r o o ps  is  required  for  its  capture.  T h e re  is,  b e s i d e s,  a  d a n g e r o us  e n e my  to 
be  e n c o u n t e r ed  in  the  deadly  climate  of  the  L o w er  C r i m e a.  As  in  this  a t t a ck 
t he  strand-batteries  c an  be  hardly  of  any  utility  to  t he  R u s s i a n s,  the  a t t e m pt 
m u st lose  a great  deal  of  its  military  interest,  r e d u c i ng itself  to  a siege of v e ry 
large,  b ut  by  no  m e a ns  u n p r e c e d e n t e d,  proportions.  T he  force  destined  for 
the  m o v e m e nt  is  n o w h e re  stated  at  a b o ve  100,000  m e n,  including  a  de 
t a c h m e nt of T u r k s.  Taking all the circumstances into a c c o u n t, this a r my d o es

T he  s t a t e m e nt  of  the  Moniteur is  on  the  w h o le  confirmed  by  the  declara-

diplomatic  point  of  view.  As  has  b e en  explained  in  The  Tribune,  a  plan  h ad 
b e en  arranged  b e t w e en A u s t r ia  and  Russia,  according to  w h i ch the Austrians 
w e re  to  o c c u py  t he  Principalities  as  s o on  as  t he  h o n or  of  t he  Czar  should 
be  satisfied  by  the  capture  of  Silistria;  the  c h a n ce  of  a R u s s i an  defeat being

to  t a ke  place  in  t h at  c a s e,  t o o.  Accordingly,  o ne  d ay  before  the  R u s s i a ns

Austria,  giving  the  latter  p o w er  the  right to  enter Wallachia. T he t r e a ty aimed 
at  t h r ee  purposes—to  withhold  the  Principalities  from  T u r k e y;  to  " r a i se  a

lastly,  to  secure  t he  safe  retreat  of  t he  Russian  a r m y.  This  treaty,  as  we  m ay 
safely  infer  from  the  confessions  of  L o rd  C l a r e n d o n,  w as  forced  u p on  t he 
P o r te  by  L o rd  Stratford  de  Redcliffe,  t he  English  E m b a s s a d or  at  Con

15  R u s s i a ns  to  retire  without  being  molested  by  pursuit.  T he  precipitate  with

unless  it  entered  into  R u s s i a 's  a g r e e m e n ts  with  Austria.  T he  Austrians  h ad 
fixed  t he  3d  of  July  for  the  e n t r a n ce  of  their  t r o o ps  into  Wallachia.  W h e n ce 
their  procrastination?  T h ey  w e re  securing  c o n c e s s i on  u p on  c o n c e s s i on from 
the  P o r t e:  firstly,  in  r e s p e ct  of  the  form  of  g o v e r n m e nt  to  be  established  in

w o u ld  n ot  include  a  declaration  of  war.  " T he  Austrian  G o v e r n m e n t ,"  says

on  t he  D a n u b e.  T he  fact  of  b o th  t h e se  p o w e rs  being  t he  tools  of  R u s s ia  d o es 
n ot  exclude  their  remaining  jealous  of  e a ch  o t h e r,  as  w as  sufficiently  e x e m-
plified by t he  " p o t a t o - w a r"  of  1850.  If Mr.  U r q u h a rt h ad p e r u s ed the  W a r s aw 
protocol  of  that  year,  he  would  not  h a ve  t u m b l ed  into  the  Quixotic  idea  of 
suddenly  propping  up  P r u s s ia  as  t he  E u r o p e an  b u l w a rk  against  Russia.

M e a n w h i l e,  h o w e v e r,  the  Turkish General  at Rustshuk—to  u se  t he  phraseol 
ogy  of  The  Times—"imagining"  the  Russians  in  full  retreat,  w e nt  over  to 
Giurgevo,  and  b e at  t h em  so  soundly  as  to  render  impossible  any  attempt  at 
retaking  possession  of  the  line  of the  D a n u b e.  In  c o n s e q u e n ce  of  this  defeat 
t he  Russians  w e re obliged to  think  seriously  of retreat,  a resolution to  w h i ch 
they  w e re  p r o m p t ed  by  t he  discovery  that  t he  ostensible  allies  of  T u r k ey 
would  no  longer  be  able  to  remain  inactive,  and  t h at the  English G o v e r n m e nt 
would  be  forced,  in  deference  to  their  a r my  as  well  as  to  t he  public,  to 
u n d e r t a ke  something  against  t h e m.  By  retiring  from  t he  Principalities  they 
i n c r e a s ed  their  defensive force in Bessarabia a nd t he  Crimea.  T h us  we learn 
by  a  telegraphic  dispatch  that  the  Russian  regiments  in  Bessarabia  and 
K h e r s on  are  to  m o ve  in  all  possible  haste  to  t he  Crimea,  while  t h o se  in 
Moldavia  m a r ch  to  o c c u py  their  places. 

It  w as  to  be  p r e s u m ed  that t he  T u r ks  would  n ot be  slow  in  improving their 
opportunity.  Their  vanguard,  u n d er  I s k a n d er B e y,  e n t e r ed  B u c h a r e st  on the 
6th  inst.,  and their General received  a deputation from  t he Wallachian Capital 
on  t he  anniversary  of  t he  day  on  which,  in  1853,  their  e n e m i es  h ad  entered 
it. 

T h us  the  Austrians  h a ve  again  lost  their  opportunity  and  are  deprived  of 
their  false  p r e t e n s es  for  entering  Wallachia.  An  o c c u p a t i on  at  this  m o m e nt 
would  bring  t h em  infallibly  into  collision  with  t he  T u r k s.  While,  therefore, 
t he  Austrian  p a p e rs  d e n o u n ce  the  a d v a n ce  of  t he  T u r ks  u p on  B u c h a r e st  as 
a b r e a ch  of  contract,  the  Austrians  themselves  are  d e n o u n c ed by t he English 
ministerial  press  for  their  slowness  and  stupidity,  in having  set  at  nought the 
fine  spun  plot.  In  The  Times of  T h u r s d ay  we  r e ad  for  i n s t a n c e:  " T he  Austri- 
ans  h a ve  lost  by  their  procrastination  the  effect  of  t he  position  t h ey  might

opportunity  and  closed  up  on  t he  heels  of  t he  retreating  e n e m y.  Wallachia 
is  n ow  in  a  great  degree  occupied  by  the  troops  of  the  Sultan.  T he  D a n u be 
from  O r s o va  to  Galatch  is  in  their  possession  and  t h e re  is  no  r e a s on  to 
s u p p o se  that  any  claim  c an  be  urged by  a foreign p o w er  to  induce  t he Turkish 
C o m m a n d er  to  r e c e de  from  a  province  which  he  holds  by  t he  right  of  the

t he  Isla  de  Leon.  Considerable  bodies  of  t r o o ps  w e re  assembled  at  Cadiz, 
in  1820,  destined  for  the  S o u t h - A m e r i c an  colonies.  All  at  o n ce  t he  a r my 
stationed  on  the  isle  declared  for  t he  Constitution  of  1812,  and  its  example

F r e n ch E m b a s s a d or  at t he  Congress  of  V e r o n a,  t h at Russia stimulated Spain 
to  u n d e r t a ke  the  expedition  into  South-America,  and  forced  F r a n ce  to

" T he  c o n d u ct  of  the  generals  and  chiefs  w o u ld  h a ve  b e en  m o re  dignified  if

a t t a c ks  against  Christina.  T h r ee  years  afterward  his  rage  for  office  t r a n s-

It  is  t r ue  t h at  this  d e c r ee  d o es  not  proclaim  universal  suffrage,  and  that 
it  r e m o v es  t he  dynastic  question  from  t he  forum  of  t he  C o r t e s.  Still  it  is 
doubtful  w h at  e v en  this  Assembly  will  d o.  If the  Spanish C o r t es forbore from 
interfering  with  the  c r o wn  in  1812,  it  w as  b e c a u se  the  c r o wn  w as  only 
nominally  represented—the  king  having  b e en  a b s e nt  for  years  from  the 
Spanish  soil.  If  t h ey  forbore  in  1837,  it  w as  b e c a u se  t h ey  h ad  to  settle  with 
absolute  m o n a r c hy  before  they  could  think  of  settling with the  constitutional 
m o n a r c h y.  With  regard  to  the  general  situation,  The  Times  h as  truly  good 
r e a s o ns  to  deplore  the  a b s e n ce  of  F r e n ch  centralization  in  Spain,  and  t h at 
c o n s e q u e n t ly  e v en  a  victory  over  revolution  in  t he  capital  decides  nothing 
with  r e s p e ct  to  the  p r o v i n c e s,  so  long  as  that  state  of  " a n a r c h y"  survives 
t h e re  without  which  no  revolution  c an  succeed.

T h e re  a r e,  of  c o u r s e,  some  incidents  in  the  Spanish revolutions  peculiarly 
belonging  to  t h e m.  F or  instance,  the  combination of r o b b e ry with revolution 
ary  transactions—a  connection  w h i ch  sprang  up  in  the  guerrilla w a rs  against

formation  t h at great  disorders  h a ve  o c c u r r ed  at T o r t o s a, in L o w er  Catalonia. 
T he  Junta  Popular of  that  city  says,  in  its  proclamation  of  31st  July:  "A  b a nd

b e c o m es  t he  eccentricity  and  the  less  effectual  is  t he  fire.  M o n t a l e m b e r t, 
t h e r e f o r e,  t o ok  great  c a re  n ot  to  p r o p o se  t he  e m p l o y m e nt  of  such  t o w e rs

t o w er  would  receive  from  its  neighbors  on  t he  right  and  left  and  from  t he 
main  fortress  in  the  rear.  If  five  or  six  s u ch  t o w e rs  could  c o n c e n t r a te  their 
fire  on  one  point,  t he  fire  would  t h en  b e c o me  as  c o n c e n t r ic  a nd  effectual 
as  it w o u ld  be  eccentric  and  w e ak before.  M o n t a l e m b e r t,  besides, k n ew v e ry

T h e r e f o r e,  beside  the  contrivances  in  his  t o w e rs  for  admitting  infantry 
d e f e n s e,  he  generally  c o n n e c t ed  the  separate  t o w e rs  by  a  sort  of  c o v e r ed 
w ay  or  t r e n c h,  n ot  for  safe  c o m m u n i c a t i on  only,  b ut  also  for  infantry  fire. 
W h at  s u ch  a  t r e n ch  can  d o,  we  h a ve  just  s e en  at  A r ab  Tabiassi,  w h e re  the 
w h o le  flanking  defense  w as  confined  to  s u ch  a  t r e n c h,  and  w h e re  t he  R u s 
sians  w e re  driven  b a c k,  time  after  t i m e,  by  a  m e re  handful  of  A r n a u t s. 
Finally,  M o n t a l e m b e rt  tried  to  m a ke  his  t o w e rs  entirely  safe  against  a  coup 
de  main.  He  surrounded  t h em  with  a  ditch,  with  a  c o v e r ed  w a y,  a nd  s o m e 
t i m es  considered  t h em  merely  as  t he  réduit,  or  last  r e s e r v ed  position  in  a

t h e se  difficulties  of  a c c e ss  he  has  t he  w h o le  of  t he  lower  story  or  cellar  of 
t he  t o w er  arranged  for  infantry  defense  in  a  v e ry  ingenious  w a y. 

N o w,  in  e v e ry  o ne  of  t h e se  r e s p e c ts  the  R u s s i a ns  a p p e ar  to  h a ve  omitted 
i m p o r t a nt  features.  T he  time  occupied  by  t he  b r e a c h i ng  fire,  t w e n ty  to thirty

from  the  e v e n t,  p r e p a r a t i o ns  against  a  coup  de  main  m u st  h a ve  b e en  alto

and  t he  r e d o u b ts  w h i ch  the  Russians  had  c o n s t r u c t ed  in  front  of  t h em  w e re

v e ry  likely  with  no  m o re  t h an  a  show  of  resistance. 

Judging  t h e se  fortifications  from  w h at  this  short  siege  m a k es  them  a p p e ar 
to  b e,  it  w o u ld  almost  seem  that  their  c o n s t r u c t o rs  n e v er  calculated  u p on 
a  serious  attack on  the  land  side.  T h ey  m u st h a ve built t he t o w e rs with a view 
merely  to  resisting t he  attacks  of parties  of  marines,  w h i ch at t he  most could 
n ot  e x c e ed  a  couple  of  t h o u s a n d s,  and n ot muster  in  sufficient  strength either 
to  a t t e m pt  an  assault  or to  c o n d u ct  to  its  close  a regular  siege.  C o n s e q u e n t ly

As  to  the  storming  itself,  it  m u st h a ve  b e en  d o ne  v e ry  well  by  b o th  F r e n ch 
a nd English. T he English are well-known stormer s ; it is their favorite maneu 
ver,  and  hardly  e v er fails  t h e m.  T he  F r e n ch prefer  to  charge  a b o dy of troops 
in  t he  o p en  field;  and  in  sieges  their  mathematical  t u rn  of  mind  prefers  t he 
m e t h o d i c al  m a r ch  of  that  eminently  F r e n ch  science  w h i ch  V a u b an invented. 
B ut  t he  ardor  of  a  British  veteran  seems  to  h a ve  driven  t h em  on.  T h e re  w as 
at  B o m a r s u nd  an  old  General  Jones—the  m an  w ho  i m p r o v ed  u p on  V a u b a n, 
w h e n,  with  hardly  half-sufficient  m e a n s,  a nd  against  b r a ve  and  d e t e r m i n ed 
garrisons,  at  B a d a j o s,  Ciudad  Rodrigo  and  Saint  Sebastian,  he  contrived  to 
s h o r t en  a  siege  by  a b o ut  one-third  of  its  prescribed  duration.  Gen.  J o n es  is 
not  a  c o m m on  engineer.  He  d o es  not,  like  the  rest  of  his  profession,  see  in 
a  siege  a  m e re  school-festival  in  which  the  chief  engineer  is  u n d er  examina 
tion,  a nd  m u st  p r o ve  before  the  eyes  of  the  a r my  h ow  far  all  the  rules  and 
regulations  of formal  sieges  and  of  V a u b a n 's  "attaque  des places fortes " a re 
retained  and  properly  arranged  in  his  m e m o r y.  He  d o es  not  think  that  the 
whole  a r my  is  t h e re  for  t he  sake  of  the  engineers,  to  p r o t e ct t h em  while  t h ey 
exhibit  their  tricks.  I n s t e ad  of  this,  Gen.  J o n es  is  first  a  soldier,  and  t h en  an 
engineer.  He  k n o ws  t he  British  soldier  well,  a nd  k n o ws  w h at  he  c an  t r u st 
him  with.  And  the  short,  determined,  and  y et  u n p r e t e n d i ng  w ay  in  w h i ch  40

As to  the  sea attack,  it w as a m e re diversion.  Only Captain Pelham profited 
by  t he  occasion  to  m a ke  a  scientific  experiment.  He  u s ed  his  long  ten-inch 
pivot  gun  w i th  all  t he  steadiness  and  regularity  of  breaching  fire,  invariably 
hitting,  as  nearly  as  possible,  t he  s a me  place.  T h e se  long  ten-inch  guns  are 
t he  finest  in  t he  British  navy.  Their  great  weight  of  metal  (ninety-five  cwt.) 
p e r m i ts  a  charge  of  sixteen  p o u n ds  of  p o w d er  to  a  solid  shot  of  sixty-eight 
p o u n d s.  T he  effect  of  this  shot,  e v en  at  a  distance  of  five  or  six  h u n d r ed 
y a r d s,  is  inconceivably  greater  t h an  that  of  t he  eighteen  or  twenty-four-
p o u nd  balls  hitherto  generally used in b r e a c h i ng batteries ;  and w h en properly 
u s e d,  could  n ot  fail  to  p r o d u ce  a  t r e m e n d o us  result.  Accordingly,  Captain

of  solid  granite, b ut t u r n ed o ut to be  a m e re facing  slab,  the  thickness  of w h i ch

T he  revolution  in  Spain  has  n ow  so  far  t a k en  on  t he  a p p e a r a n ce  of  a  per

wealthy  and  conservative  classes  h a ve b e g un to  emigrate  a nd to  seek security 
in  F r a n c e.  This  is  not  surprising; Spain has n e v er a d o p t ed t he m o d e rn F r e n ch 
fashion,  so  generally  in  vogue  in  1848,  of  beginning  a nd  accomplishing  a 
revolution  in  t h r ee  d a y s.  H er  efforts  in  t h at  line  are  c o m p l ex  and  m o re 
prolonged.  T h r ee  years  seems  to  be  the  shortest  limit  to  w h i ch  she  restricts 
herself,  while  h er  revolutionary  cycle  sometimes  e x p a n ds  to  nine.  T h us  her 
first revolution  in the p r e s e nt c e n t u ry e x t e n d ed from  1808 to  1814; the  second 
from  1820  to  1823;  and  the  third  from  1834  to  1843.  H ow  long  the  p r e s e nt 
o ne  will  c o n t i n u e,  or  in  w h at  it  will  result,  it  is  impossible  for  the  k e e n e st

C o r t e s.  T h e re  w e re  circumstances  in  the  formation  of  the  Spanish  kingdom

misapplication  of  former  subsidies  to  o p e r a t i o ns  foreign  to  the  interests  of 
Spain,  t he  Cortes  refused  all  supplies.  Carlos  dismissed t h em in a rage;  and,

C h u r ch  w as  transformed  into  the  m o st  formidable  tool  of  absolutism.

Since  the  establishment  of  absolute  m o n a r c hy  t h ey  h a ve  vegetated  in  a

political  or  economical,  which  destroyed  Spanish c o m m e r c e,  industry,  navi

the fact.  As  the  commercial  and  industrial  life  of  t he  t o w ns  declined, internal 
e x c h a n g es  b e c a me r a r e, the  mingling of t he inhabitants  of  different p r o v i n c es 
less  frequent,  the  m e a ns  of  communication  neglected,  a nd  the  great  r o a ds 
gradually  deserted.  T h us  t he  local  life  of  Spain,  t he  i n d e p e n d e n ce  of  its

n ow  finally  strengthened  and  confirmed  by  the  e c o n o m i c al  revolution w h i ch 
dried  up  the  sources  of  national  activity.  A nd  while  t he  absolute  m o n a r c hy 
found  in  Spain  material  in  its  v e ry  n a t u re  repulsive  to  centralization,  it  did 
all  in  its  p o w er  to  p r e v e nt  t he  g r o w th  of  c o m m on  interests  arising  out  of  a 
national  division  of  labor  and  the  multiplicity of internal exchanges—the  v e ry 
basis  on  w h i ch  alone  a  uniform  s y s t em  of  administration  and  t he  rule  of 
general  laws  c an  be  created.  T h us  the  absolute  m o n a r c hy  in  Spain,  bearing  35 
b ut  a  superficial  r e s e m b l a n ce  to  the  absolute  m o n a r c h i es  of  E u r o pe  in 
general,  is  r a t h er  to  be  ranged  in  a  class  w i th  Asiatic  f o r ms  of  g o v e r n m e n t. 
Spain,  like T u r k e y,  r e m a i n ed an agglomeration of  m i s m a n a g ed republics  with 
a  nominal  sovereign  at  their  head.  Despotism  changed  c h a r a c t er  in  the  dif

Revolutionary  Spain. 

We  h a ve  already  laid  before  our  r e a d e rs  a  survey  of the  earlier revolutionary 
history  of  Spain,  as  a  m e a ns  of  understanding  a nd  appreciating  t he  de

Still  m o re  interesting,  and  p e r h a ps  equally  valuable  as  a  s o u r ce  of  p r e s e nt 
instruction,  is  the  great  national  m o v e m e nt  t h at  a t t e n d ed  t he  expulsion  of

heroic  episodes  a nd  m e m o r a b le  exhibition  of  vitality  in  a  people  supposed 
to  be  m o r i b u n d,  we  m u st  go  b a ck to  the  beginning of t he  N a p o l e o n ic  assault 
on  the  nation.  T he  efficient  cause  of  the  whole  w as  p e r h a ps  first  stated  in 
the  treaty  of  Tilsit,  w h i ch  w as  concluded  on  July 7 , 1 8 0 7,  a nd  is  said  to  h a ve 
received  its  c o m p l è t e m e nt  through  a  secret  c o n v e n t i o n,  signed  by  Prince 
K o u r a k in  and  Talleyrand.  It  w as  published  in  the  Madrid  Gaceta  on  Au 
gust  25,  1812,  containing,  among  other  things,  t he following  stipulations:

"Art.  I.  Russia  is  to  take  possession  of  E u r o p e an  T u r k e y,  and  to  extend

Art. II.  T he  B o u r b on  d y n a s ty  in  Spain  and 

the  h o u se  of  B r a g a n za  in 
Portugal  will  c e a se  to  reign.  Princes  of  the  B o n a p a r te  family  will  succeed 
to  b o th  of  t h e se  c r o w n s ." 

Supposing  this  treaty  to  be  authentic,  and  its  authenticity  is  scarcely 
disputed,  e v en  in  the  recently  published  memoirs  of  King J o s e ph B o n a p a r t e, 
it  f o r m ed  the  true  r e a s on  for  the  F r e n ch invasion  of  Spain  in  1808,  while  the 
Spanish  c o m m o t i o ns  of  t h at  time  would  seem  to  be  linked by  secret t h r e a ds

10  A l r e a dy  at  the  times  of  Philip  V.,  F r a n c i s co  Benito  de  la  Soledad  had  said: 
"All  the  evils  of  Spain  are  derived  from t he  togados  (lawyers)."  At t he  h e ad 
of  the  mischievous  magisterial  hierarchy  of  Spain  w as  placed  the  Consejo 
Real  of  Castile.  Sprung  up  in  the  turbulent  times  of  the  D on  J u a ns  and  t he 
E n r i q u e s,  strengthened  by  Philip  II,  w ho  discovered  in  it  a  w o r t hy  c o m-

most h e t e r o g e n e o us  attributes,  and to  add to  its functions  of Highest Tribunal 
those  of  a  legislator  and  of  an  administrative  superintendent  of  all  the  king 
d o ms  of  Spain.  T h us  it  surpassed in p o w er e v en t he  F r e n ch Parliament which 
it  resembled  in  m a ny  points,  e x c e pt that it w as  never  to  be  found  on  the  side 
of  t he  people.  Having  b e en  the  m o st  powerful  authority  in  ancient  Spain, 
t he  Consejo  Real w a s,  of  c o u r s e,  t he  m o st  implacable  foe  to  a  new  Spain, 
and  to  all  the  recent  popular  authorities  threatening  to  cripple  its  s u p r e me 
influence.  Being  the  great  dignitary  of  t he  o r d er  of  the  lawyers  and  the 
incarnate  guaranty  of  all  its  a b u s es  and  privileges,  t he  Consejo  naturally 
disposed  of  all  the  n u m e r o us  and  influential  interests  vested  in  Spanish

allowed  to  s w e ep  away  t he  revolution in  its  turn.  As we h a ve  s e en in a former

t h e m s e l v es  doing  nothing  and  by  preventing  others  from  doing  anything. 
During  their  stay  at  Seville, on July  20,1809,  e v en the  English  T o ry  G o v e r n-
15  ment  thought  n e c e s s a ry  to  a d d r e ss  t h em  a  n o te  strongly  protesting  against 
their  counter-revolutionary  c o u r se  " a p p r e h e n d i ng  t h at  t h ey  w e re  likely  to 
suffocate  t he  public  e n t h u s i a s m ."  It  h as  b e en  r e m a r k ed  s o m e w h e re  t h at 
Spain  endured  all  the  evils  of  revolution  without  acquiring  revolutionary 
strength.  If  t h e re  be  any  t r u th  in  this  r e m a r k,  it  is  a  sweeping  c o n d e m n a t i on 
p a s s ed  u p on  the  Central  Junta.

We  h a ve  thought  it  the  m o re  n e c e s s a ry  to  dwell  u p on  this  point,  as  its 
decisive  i m p o r t a n ce  has  n e v er  b e en  u n d e r s t o od  by  any  E u r o p e an  historian. 
Exlusively  under  the  reign  of  the  Central  J u n t a,  it w as  possible  to  blend  w i th 
the  actualities  a nd  exigencies  of  national  defense  t he  transformation  of 
Spanish  society,  a nd the  emancipation of the native  spirit, without w h i ch any 
political  constitution  must  dissolve  like  a  p h a n t om  at  t he  slightest  c o m b at 
with  real  life.  T he  C o r t es  w e re  placed  in  quite  opposite  circumstances—they 
t h e m s e l v es  driven  b a ck  to  an  insulated  spot  of  t he  Peninsula,  cut  off  from 
the  main  b o dy  of  the  m o n a r c hy  during t wo  y e a rs  by a besieging F r e n ch a r m y, 
a nd  representing  ideal  Spain  while  real  Spain  w as  c o n q u e r ed  or  fighting.  At 
the  time  of  the  Cortes  Spain w as  divided  into  two  p a r t s.  At the  Isla de  L e o n, 
ideas  without  action—in  t he  rest  of  Spain,  action  without  ideas.  At  the  time 
of  t he  Central  Junta,  on  the  contrary,  particular  w e a k n e s s,  incapacity  and 
ill  will  w e re  required  on  t he  part  of  t he  S u p r e me  G o v e r n m e nt to  d r aw  a line 
of  distinction  b e t w e en  the  Spanish  w ar  and  t he  Spanish  revolution.  T he 
C o r t e s,  therefore,  failed,  not,  as  F r e n ch  a nd  English writers  assert,  b e c a u se 
they  w e re  revolutionists,  but  b e c a u se  their  p r e d e c e s s o rs  had  b e en  reaction 
ists  a nd  h ad  missed  the  p r o p er  season  of  revolutionary  action.  M o d e rn 
Spanish  writers,  offended  by  the  A n g l o - F r e n ch  critics,  h a ve  nevertheless

T he  Central  J u n ta  failed  in  the  defense  of  their  c o u n t r y,  b e c a u se  t h ey failed 
in  their  revolutionary  mission.  Conscious  of  their  o wn  w e a k n e s s,  of  the

In  revolutionary  times,  w h en  all  ties  of  subordination  are  loosened,  mili 
t a ry  discipline  c an  only  be restored by  civil discipline  sternly weighing u p on

trolling  the  soldiers, a nd to the  end of the w ar the  Spanish a r my n e v er r e a c h ed 
an  average  degree  of discipline  and  subordination.  This  insubordination  w as

of  an  army—for  t he  moral  of  an  army,  as  N a p o l e on  called  it,  d e p e n ds  alto

T h e re  are  three  periods  to  be  distinguished  in  the  history  of  the  guerrilla 
warfare.  In  t he  first  period  t he  population  of  w h o le  provinces  t o ok  up  a r ms 
and m a de  a partisan warfare,  as  in Galicia and Asturias. In the  second period, 
guerrilla  b a n ds  formed  of  the  w r e c ks  of  t he  Spanish  armies,  of  Spanish 
deserters  from  the  F r e n ch  armies,  of  smugglers,  etc.,  carried  on  the  w ar  as 
their  o wn  c a u s e,  independently  of  all  foreign  influence  and  agreeably to their

a r m a m e nt  of  the  p e o p l e.  As  soon  as  an  o p p o r t u n i ty  for  a  c a p t u re  offered

according  to  the  object  of  their  undertaking.  It  w as  not  u n c o m m on  to  see 
t h em  standing  out  a  whole  day  in  sight  of  a  vigilant  e n e m y,  in  order  to 
intercept  a  carrier  or  to  c a p t u re  supplies.  It w as  in  this  w ay  that the  younger

T h o u s a n ds  of  enemies  w e re  on t he  spot, t h o u gh n ot o ne could be discovered. 
No  courier  could  be  dispatched  without  being  t a k e n;  no  supplies  could  set

without  being  o b s e r v ed  by  a  hundred  e y e s.  At  the  same  time,  t h e re  existed 
no  m e a ns  of  striking  at  the  r o ot  of  a  combination  of  this  kind.  T he  F r e n ch

gives  a  true  picture  of  t he  F r e n ch  a r m y ."  In  their  third  period,  the  guerrillas 
aped  the  regularity  of  the  standing  army,  swelled  their  c o r ps  to  the  n u m b er 
of  from  3,000  to  6,000  men,  c e a s ed  to  be  t he  c o n c e rn  of  w h o le  districts,  and 
fell into  the  h a n ds  of  a few  leaders, w ho  m a de s u ch use of t h em as best suited 
their  o wn  p u r p o s e s.  This  change  in  t he  s y s t em  of  t he  guerrillas  gave  t he 
F r e n c h,  in  their  c o n t e s ts  with  t h e m,  considerable  a d v a n t a g e.  R e n d e r ed  in

guerrilleros  w e re  n ow  frequently  overtaken,  defeated,  dispersed,  and  dis-

By  c o m p a r i ng  the  three  periods  of  guerrilla  warfare  with  t he  political

On  the  other  hand,  the  a r my  and  guerrilleros—which  received  during  t he 
15  w ar  part  of  their  chiefs,  like  Porlier,  L a c y,  E r ó l es  and Villacampa,  from t he 
r a n ks  of  distinguished  officers  of  the  line,  while  the  line  in  its  turn  afterward 
received  guerrilla chiefs,  like  Mina,  E m p e c i n a d o, etc.—were the  m o st revolu 
tionized  portion  of  Spanish  society,  recruited  as  they  w e re  from  all  r a n k s, 
including  the  whole  of  t he  fiery,  aspiring  a nd  patriotic  youth,  inaccessible 
to  the  soporific  influence  of  the  Central  G o v e r n m e n t;  e m a n c i p a t ed from  the 
shackles  of t he  ancient  régime;  part  of  t h e m,  like  Riego, returning after  some 
y e a r s'  captivity  in  F r a n c e.  We  are,  t h e n,  n ot  to  be  surprised  at the  influence 
exercised  by  the  Spanish  a r my  in  s u b s e q u e nt  c o m m o t i o n s;  neither  w h en 
taking  t he  revolutionary  initiative,  nor  w h en  spoiling t he  revolution by  p r a e-

As  to  the  guerrillas,  it  is  evident  that,  having  for  some  years  figured  u p on 
the  theater  of  sanguinary  c o n t e s t s,  t a k en  to  roving  habits,  freely  indulged 
all  their  passions  of  h a t r e d,  r e v e n g e,  and  love  of  plunder,  t h ey  m u s t,  in times 
of  p e a c e,  form  a  most  dangerous  m o b,  always  ready  at  a  n od  in  t he  n a me 
of  any  p a r ty  or  principle,  to  step  forward  for  him  w ho  is  able  to  give  t h em 
good  p ay  or  to  afford  t h em  a  p r e t e xt  for  plundering  excursions.

T he  c i r c u m s t a n c es  under  which  this  Congress  m et  are  w i t h o ut  parallel  in

F r e n c h,  a nd  t he  Congress  itself,  actually  c ut  off  from  Spain  by  hostile 
a r m i e s,  a nd  relegated  to  a  small  n e ck  of  land,  h ad  to  legislate  in  the  sight of 
a  surrounding  a nd  besieging  army.  F r om  the  r e m o te  angle  of  t he  Isla

w a rd  b r a n d ed  by  t he  c r o w n ed  h e a ds  of  E u r o p e,  a s s e m b l ed  at  V e r o n a,  as  the

constitution,  vanishing  like  a  shadow—like  t he  "sueño  de  sombra, " say t he 
Spanish  historians—when  brought  into  c o n t a ct  with  a living  B o u r b o n?  If  t he 
b i r th  of  t h at  Constitution  is  a  riddle,  its  d e a th  is  no  less  so.  To  solve  the 
enigma,  we  p r o p o se  to  c o m m e n ce  with  a  short  r e v i ew  of  this  s a me  Consti- 
tution  of  1812,  w h i ch  the  Spaniards  tried  again  to  realize  at  t wo  s u b s e q u e nt 
e p o c h s,  first  during  t he  period  from  1820-'23,  a nd  t h en  in  1836. 

T he  Constitution  of  1812  consists  of  384  articles  a nd  c o m p r e h e n ds  the 
following  10  divisions:  1.  On  the  Spanish  nation  a nd  t he  S p a n i a r d s.  2.  On 
t he  territory  of  Spain;  its  religion,  g o v e r n m e n t,  a nd  on  Spanish  citizens.  3. 
On  t he  C o r t e s.  4.  On  t he  King.  5.  On  the  tribunals  and  administration  of 
justice  in  civil  and  criminal  m a t t e r s.  6.  On  t he  interior  g o v e r n m e nt  of  the 
p r o v i n c es  a nd c o m m u n e s.  7.  On the t a x e s.  8.  On t he  national  military forces. 
9.  On public education.  10.  On the  o b s e r v a n ce  of  the  Constitution,  and m o de 
of  p r o c e e d i ng  to  m a ke  alternations  therein. 

P r o c e e d i ng  from  the  principle  that  " t he  sovereignty  resides  essentially  in 

t he  nation,  to  which,  therefore,  alone  belongs  exclusively t he  right  of  e s t a b 
lishing  fundamental  l a w s ,"  the  Constitution,  n e v e r t h e l e s s,  proclaims  a  divi 
sion  of  p o w e r s,  according  to  which,  " T he  legislative  p o w er  is  placed  in  t he 
C o r t es  jointly  with  the  K i n g ;"  " t he  execution  of  the  laws  is  confided  to  the 
K i n g ,"  " t he  application  of  t he  laws  in  civil  a nd  criminal  affairs  belongs 
exclusively to  t he  tribunals,  neither  t he  C o r t es  n or  t he K i ng being in  any c a se 
e m p o w e r ed  to  exercise  judicial  authority,  a d v o c a te  p e n d i ng  c a s e s,  or  c o m

It  being  o ne  of  their  principal  aims  to  hold  p o s s e s s i on  of  the  A m e r i c an

T he  Constitution  of  1812  has  been  accused  on  the  o ne  hand—for  instance, 
by  F e r d i n a nd  V II  himself  (see  his  decree  of  M ay  4,  1814)—of  being  a  mere 
imitation  of  the  F r e n ch  Constitution  of  1791,  t r a n s p l a n t ed  on  t he  Spanish 
soil  by  visionaries,  regardless  of  t he  historical  traditions  of  Spain.  On  the 
other  h a n d,  it  has  b e en  contended—for  instance,  by  t he  A b bé  de  P r a dt  (De 
la  Révolution  actuelle  de  l'Espagne)-that  t he  C o r t es  u n r e a s o n a b ly  clung  to 
antiquated  formulas,  b o r r o w ed  from  the  ancient  Fueros,  a nd  belonging  to 
feudal  t i m e s,  w h en  the  royal  authority  w as  c h e c k ed  by  t he  exorbitant privi- 
leges  of  t he  g r a n d e e s. 

T he  truth  is  that  the  Constitution  of  1812  is  a  r e p r o d u c t i on  of  the  ancient 
F u e r o s,  b ut  read  in  t he  light  of  the  F r e n ch  Revolution,  a nd  a d a p t ed  to  t he 
w a n ts  of  m o d e rn  society.  T he  right  of  insurrection,  for  i n s t a n c e,  is  generally 
regarded  as  o ne  of  t he  boldest  innovations  of  t he  J a c o b in  Constitution  of 
1793,  b ut  y ou  m e et  this  same  right  in  the  ancient  F u e r os  of  S o b r a r b e,  w h e re 
it  is  called  t he  "Privilegio  de  la  Union. "  Y ou  find  it  also  in  t he  ancient 
Constitution  of  Castile.  According  to  the  F u e r os  of  S o b r a r b e,  t he  K i ng 
c a n n ot  m a ke  p e a ce  nor  declare  war,  nor  conclude  treaties,  without  the

120  p e r s o ns  p r e s e n t ed  to  t he  King  by  t he  C o r t es  a nd  paid  by  them—this 
singular  creation  of  the  Constitution  of  1812  w as  suggested  by  the  r e 
m e m b r a n ce  of  t he  fatal  influence  exercised  by  t he  Camarillas  at  all  e p o c hs 
of  the  Spanish  M o n a r c h y.  T he  State  Council  w as  intended  to  supersede  t he 
5  Camarilla.  Besides,  t h e re  existed  analogous  institutions  in  t he  past.  At  t he 
time  of  F e r d i n a nd  IV,  for  instance,  the  K i ng  w as  always  surrounded  by 
t w e l ve  c o m m o n e r s,  designated  by  t he  cities  of  Castille,  to  serve  as  his  privy 
councilors;  and,  in  1419,  the  Delegates  of  the  cities  complained  t h at  their 
c o m m i s s i o n e rs  w e re  no  longer  admitted  into  t he  King's  council.  T he  e x-
elusion  of  the  highest functionaries and the m e m b e rs of the King's household 
from  t he  C o r t e s,  as  well  as  t he  prohibition  to  t he  D e p u t i es  to  a c c e pt  h o n o rs 
or  offices  on  the  p a rt  of  the  King,  s e e m s,  at first view,  to  be  b o r r o w ed  from 
t he  Constitution  of  1791,  and  naturally  to  flow  from  t he  m o d e rn  division  of 
p o w e r s,  sanctioned  by  t he  Constitution  of  1812.  But,  in  fact,  we  m e et  n ot 
only  in  t he  ancient  Constitution  of  Castille  with  p r e c e d e n t s,  but  we  k n ow 
t h at  the  people,  at  different  times,  r o se  and  assassinated  the  D e p u t i es  w ho 
h ad  a c c e p t ed  h o n o rs  or  offices  from t he  C r o w n.  As  to  t he  right  of  t he  Cortes 
to  appoint  regencies  in  c a se  of  minority,  it  h ad  continually  b e en  exercised 
by  t he  ancient  Cortes  of  Castille  during t he  long  minorities  of t he  f o u r t e e n th 
c e n t u r y.

It is  true  t h at the  Cadiz  C o r t es  deprived the  king of t he p o w er he  had  always 
e x e r c i s ed  of  convoking,  dissolving,  or  proroguing  t he  C o r t e s;  b ut  as  t he 
C o r t es  had  fallen  into  disuse  by  the v e ry m a n n er in w h i ch the  kings  i m p r o v ed 
their  privileges,  t h e re  w as  nothing  m o re  evident  t h an  t he  necessity of cancel-
ing  it.  T he  alleged  facts  m ay  suffice  to  show  t h at  the  anxious  limitation  of 
t he  royal  power—the  most  striking feature  of  t he  constitution  of  1812—other 
wise  fully  explained  by  the  r e c e nt  and  revolting  souvenirs  of  G o d o y 's  con 
temptible  despotism,  derived  its  origin  from t he  ancient F u e r os  of  Spain.  T he 
C a d iz  C o r t es  b ut  transferred  the  control  from  t he  privileged  estates  to  t he 
national  representation.  H ow  m u ch  t he  Spanish  kings  stood  in  a we  of  t he 
ancient  F u e r os  m ay  be  seen  from  the  fact  t h at  w h en  a  n ew  collection  of  the 
Spanish  laws  h ad  b e c o me  n e c e s s a r y,  in  1805,  a  royal  o r d i n a n ce  o r d e r ed t he 
r e m o v al  from  it  of  all the  r e m a i ns  of feudalism  contained  in the last collection 
of  laws,  and  belonging  to  a time  w h en t he  w e a k n e ss  of  t he  m o n a r c hy  forced 
the  kings  to  enter  with  their  vassals  into  c o m p r o m i s es  derogatory  to  the 
sovereign  p o w e r. 

If  the  election  of  the  D e p u t i es  by  general  suffrage  w as  an  innovation,  it 
m u st  not  be  forgotten  t h at  t he  C o r t es  of  1812  w e re  t h e m s e l v es  elected  by 
general  suffrage,  that  all  the  juntas  h ad  b e en  elected  by  it;  that  a  limitation 
of  it  would,  therefore,  h a ve  b e en  an  infraction  of  a right  already  c o n q u e r ed 
by  the  people ;  and,  lastly,  that  a p r o p e r ty qualification,  at a time w h en almost

all  t he  real  p r o p e r ty  of  Spain  w as  locked  up  in  mortmain,  w o u ld  h a ve  ex

T he  meeting  of  the  Representatives  in  o ne  single  h o u se  w as  by  no  m e a ns 
c o p i ed  from  t he  F r e n ch  Constitution  of  1791,  as  t he  m o r o se  English  Tories 
will  h a ve  it.  O ur  r e a d e rs  know  already  that  since  Charles  I  (the  E m p e r or 
Charles  V)  t he  aristocracy  and  t he  clergy  h ad  lost  their  seats  in  t he  Cortes 
of  Castille.  B ut  e v en  at  t he  times  w h en  t he  C o r t es  w e re  divided  into  brazos, 
( a r m s,  branches,)  representing  the  different  e s t a t e s,  t h ey  a s s e m b l ed  in  one 
single  hall,  separated  only  by  their  seats,  and  voting  in  c o m m o n.  F r om  the 
P r o v i n c e s,  in  which  alone  the  Cortes  still  p o s s e s s ed real p o w er  at t he  e p o ch 
of  the  F r e n ch  invasion,  N a v a r re  continued  the  old  c u s t om  of  convoking  the 
C o r t es  by  estates ;  b ut  in  the  Vascongadas  t he  altogether  d e m o c r a t ic  assem 
blies  admitted  not  e v en  the  clergy.  Besides,  if  the  clergy  and  aristocracy  had 
saved  their  obnoxious  privileges,  they  h ad  long  since  c e a s ed  to  form  inde 
p e n d e nt  political  bodies,  the  existence  of  w h i ch  constituted  the  basis  of  the 
c o m p o s i t i on  of  the  ancient  Cortes. 

T he  separation  of  the  judiciary  from  the  executive  p o w e r,  d e c r e ed  by  the 
Cadiz  C o r t e s,  w as  d e m a n d ed  as  early  as  the  eighteenth  c e n t u r y,  by  the  most 
enlightened  s t a t e s m en  of  Spain;  and  the  general  odium  w h i ch  the  Consejo 
Real,  from  the  beginning  of  the  revolution,  h ad  c o n c e n t r a t ed  u p on  itself, 
m a de  the  necessity  of  reducing the  tribunals  to  their  p r o p er  sphere  of  action 
universally  felt. 

T he  section  of  the  Constitution w h i ch refers  to  the Municipal G o v e r n m e nt 
of  the  c o m m u n e s,  is  a  genuine  Spanish  offspring,  as  we  h a ve  s h o wn  in  a 
former  article.  T he  Cortes  only reestablished the old municipal  s y s t e m , w h i le 
t h ey  stripped  off  its  mediaeval  character.  As  to  t he  provincial  deputations, 
invested  with  the  same  p o w e rs  for  the  internal  g o v e r n m e nt of  the  provinces 
as  t he  a y u n t a m i e n t os  for  the  administration  of  t he  c o m m u n e s,  t he  Cortes 
modelled  t h em  in  imitation  of  similar  institutions  still  existing  at  the  time  of 
t he  invasion  in  N a v a r r e,  Biscaya and  Asturias.  In  abolishing t he  e x e m p t i o ns 
from  the  military  service,  the  Cortes  sanctioned  only  w h at  h ad  b e c o me  the 
general  practice  during  the  w ar  of  i n d e p e n d e n c e.  T he  abolition  of  the  in 
quisition  w as  also  but  t he  sanction  of  a  fact,  as  the  holy  office,  although 
reestablished  by  t he  Central  Junta,  h ad  n ot  dared  to  r e s u me  its  functions, 
its  holy  m e m b e rs  being  content  with  pocketing  their  salaries,  and  p r u d e n t ly 
waiting  for  better  times.  As  to  t he  suppression  of  feudal  a b u s e s,  the  Cortes 
w e nt  n ot  e v en  the  length of the  reforms  insisted u p on in the f a m o us  memorial 
of  Jovellanos,  p r e s e n t ed  in  1795  to  the  Consejo  Real  in  the  n a me  of  the 
economical  society  of  Madrid.

steps  in  this  direction.  B e s i d e s,  it  m u st  n ot  be  forgotten that  simultaneously 
with  the  C o r t e s,  t h e re  sat  a  F r e n ch  G o v e r n m e nt  at  Madrid,  which,  in  all t he 
p r o v i n c es  o v e r r un  by  the  armies  of  N a p o l e o n,  had  swept  a w ay from  the  soil 
all  monastic  and  feudal  institutions,  and  i n t r o d u c ed  t he  m o d e rn  s y s t em  of 
administration.  T he  Bonapartist  p a p e rs  d e n o u n c ed  the  insurrection  as  en 
tirely  p r o d u c ed  by  the  artifices  and  bribes  of  England,  assisted  by t he  m o n ks 
a nd  the  Inquisition.  H ow  far  t he  rivalry  with  the  intruding  G o v e r n m e nt m u st 
h a ve  exercised  a  salutary  influence  u p on  t he  decisions  of  t he  Cortes,  may 
be  inferred  from  the  fact  that  the  Central  J u n ta  itself,  in  its  d e c r ee  dated 
10  S e p t e m b e r,  1809,  wherein  the  c o n v o c a t i on  of  t he  C o r t es  is  a n n o u n c e d, 
a d d r e s s ed  the  Spaniards  in  the  following t e r m s:  " O ur  d e t r a c t o rs  say  that  we 
are  fighting  to  defend  old  abuses  and  the  i n v e t e r a te  vices  of  our  c o r r u p t ed 
G o v e r n m e n t.  L et  t h em  k n ow  that  your  struggle  is  for  the  happiness  as  well 
as  the  i n d e p e n d e n ce  of  your  c o u n t r y;  that y ou  will n ot d e p e nd h e n c e f o r w a rd

On  the  other  hand,  we  m ay  t r a ce  in  the  Constitution  of  1812  s y m p t o ms 
not  to  be  m i s t a k en  of  a  c o m p r o m i se  e n t e r ed  into  b e t w e en  the  liberal  ideas  of 
the  eighteenth  century  and  the  dark  traditions  of  priestcraft.  It  suffices  to 
quote  Art.  12,  according  to  which  " t he  religion  of  t he  Spanish  nation  is  and 
shall  be  perpetually  Catholic,  Apostolic,  and  R o m a n,  t he  only  true  religion. 
T he  nation  p r o t e c ts  it  by  wise  and  j u st  l a w s,  and  prohibits  t he  exercise  of 
any  other w h a t e v e r ;"  or Art.  173,  ordering the  King to  t a k e,  on  his  accession 
to  t he  t h r o n e,  t he  following  oath  before  t he  C o r t e s:  " N .,  by the grace of God, 
and  the  Constitution  of  the  Spanish  M o n a r c h y,  K i ng  of  Spain,  I  swear  by 
t he  Almighty  and  t he  H o ly  Evangelists,  t h at  I  will  defend  a nd  p r e s e r ve  t he 
Catholic,  R o m a n,  and  Apostolic  religion,  w i t h o ut  tolerating  any  other  in  t he 
k i n g d o m ." 

On  a  closer  analysis,  then,  of  the  Constitution  of  1812,  we  arrive  at  t he 
conclusion  that,  so  far  from  being  a  servile  c o py  of  the  F r e n ch  Constitution 
of  1791,  it  w as  a  genuine  and  original  offspring  of  Spanish  intellectual  life, 
regenerating  the  ancient  and  national  institutions,  introducing  t he  m e a s u r es 
of  reform  loudly  d e m a n d ed  by  the  m o st  celebrated  a u t h o rs  and  s t a t e s m en 
of  the  eighteenth  century,  making  inevitable  c o n c e s s i o ns  to  popular  preju

It  w o u l d,  h o w e v e r,  be  a  great  mistake  to  s u p p o se  t h at  t he  majority  of  the

himself  gave  him  a  p u r se  of  gold  and  t he  requisite  o r d e rs  for  t he  t r o o ps  of 
La  M a n c h a.  B ut  on  his  arrival  at  O c a ñ a,  La  Bisbal  p ut  himself  at  t he  h e ad 
of  t he  t r o o ps  and  proclaimed  t he  C o n s t i t u t i on  of  1812.  T he  n e ws  of  this

On  his  r e t u rn  from  F r a n c e,  he  had  held  o ut  t he  s a me  p r o m i se  and  failed  to

on  t he  9th,  he  saved  himself  only by reestablishing t he M a d r id A y u n t a m i e n to

care  for  false  o a t h s,  having  always  at  h a nd  a  c o n f e s s or  r e a dy  to  grant  him 
full  remission  of  all  possible  sins.  Simultaneously  a  Consultative  J u n ta  w as 
established,  t he  first  d e c r ee  of  w h i ch  set  free  t he  political  prisoners  and 
recalled  t he  political  refugees.  T he  p r i s o n s,  n ow  o p e n e d,  sent  t he  first

guelles—who  formed  t he  first  Ministry—were  m a r t y rs  of  1814,  and D e p u t i es 
of  1812.  T he  true  source  of  t he  e n t h u s i a sm  w h i ch  h ad  a p p e a r ed  on  t he 
accession  of  F e r d i n a nd  to  t he  t h r o n e,  w as  j oy  at  t he  r e m o v al  of  Charles  IV.,

of  t he  Constitution  of  1812,  w as  j oy  at  t he  r e m o v al  of  F e r d i n a nd  V I I.  As  to

by  t wo  gens  d ' a r m es  at  Zurich,  but  only  for  a  few  h o u r s,  after  which  he 
e s c a p e d.  This  e s c a pe  was  facilitated  by  another  Italian  causing  himself  to

With  regard  to  the  " b r o ad  d a y"  in  which  the  Débats effects  the  d e p a r t u re

At  last  it  seems  possible  that  the  F r e n ch  a nd  English  m ay  strike  a  serious 
blow  at  t he  p o w er  and  prestige  of  Russia,  and  we  in  this  c o u n t ry  are  a c 
cordingly  looking  with r e n e w ed  interest to  the  m o v e m e nt against  Sevastopol, 
t he  latest  intelligence  from  w h i ch is  detailed  in a n o t h er  column.  As  a matter 
of  c o u r s e,  the  British  and  F r e n ch  journals  m a ke  a  great  p a r a de  a b o ut  this

plicable  delays  a nd  senseless  apologies  attending  t he  setting  out  of  t he 
expedition,  and  all  the  c i r c u m s t a n c es  preceding a nd  attending it—will refuse 
to  be  i m p o s ed  u p o n.  T he  termination  of  t he  enterprise  may  be  glorious,  b ut 
its  origin  would  rather  seem  to  be  disgraceful.

ever,  w as  accomplished,  t h ey  stretched  their  courage  to  an  u n e x p e c t ed 
extent,  and  risked  a  landing  on  t he  T h r a c i an  C h e r s o n e s us  at  Gallipoli.  B ut 
this  w as  merely  d o ne  in  order  to  h a ve  the  defensive  w o r ks  across  t he  penin-

of  t he  expedition  to  t he  Crimea. 

After  the  experience  of  this  s u m m e r 's  campaigning,  or  r a t h er  p r o m e n a d

s h ow  w h at  their  arguments  are  worth.  T he  delay  w as  owing,  it  w as  said,  to

if  the  F r e n ch  siege  train  had  not  arrived  in  the  m e an  time,  t h ey  w o u ld  h a ve

F or  all  t h at  the  expedition  m ay  be  successful.  T he  allies  almost  d e s e r ve

is  to  be  landed  close  to  t he  latter  place,  to  s a ve  t he trouble  of land-carriage;

T he  first  attack,  we  are  led  to  believe  from  s t a t e m e n ts  in  t he  British

c o m m a n d i ng  the  t o wn  from  a  hill  on  the  n o r th  side.  This  is  called  by  t he 
30  Russians  S e v e r n a ya  K r e p o s t,  t he  N o r t h e rn  F o r t.  If  this  fort is  anything like 
solidly  c o n s t r u c t e d,  it  is  capable  of  lengthy  r e s i s t a n c e.  It  is  a  large  square 
r e d o u b t, 
caponnière, 
c o n s t r u c t ed  u p on  M o n t a l e m b e r t 's  polygonal,  or 
s y s t e m,  the  flanking  defense  being  f o r m ed  by  a  low  c a s e m a t ed  w o rk  lying 
at  t he  b o t t om  of  the  ditch  in  t he  middle  of  e a ch  side  of  t he  square,  a nd 
sweeping  the  ditch  b o th  right  a nd  left.  T h e se  w o r ks  h a ve  the  advantage  of

w o r ks  to  the  v e ry  brink  of  the  ditch.  T he  proximity  of  this  w o rk to  the  main 
fortress  allows  it  to  be  m a de  u se  of  offensively  as  a  support  a nd  b a se  for 
strong  sorties,  and  altogether  its  p r e s e n ce  m u st  force  the  allies  to  confine 
their  main  operations  to  the  n o r t h e rn  shore  of  the  bay.

O ur  c o l u m ns  this  morning  are  filled  w i th  the  stirring  n e ws  of  sanguinary

We  m u s t,  t h e n,  distinguish  the  s t a t e m e n ts  into  t wo  classes—those  relating 
to  t he  battle  of  t he  Alma,  fought  on  Sept. 20,  and  t h o se  announcing  t he 
c a p t u re  of  Sevastopol  itself.  A c c o r d i ng  to  the  dispatches  of  L o rd Raglan and 
15  M a r s h al  St.  A r n a u d,  t he  allied  armies  on  t he  20th  s t o r m ed  the  R u s s i an  in 
t r e n c h ed  c a mp  on  the  hights  to  the  s o u th  of  the  river  A l m a,  and  forced  t he 
R u s s i a ns  to  retreat.  T he  British t o ok t wo  g u n s.  T he  F r e n c h, in their dispatch, 
mention  no  trophies  at  all.  T he  F r e n ch loss w as  a b o ut  1,400;  British t he  s a m e. 
T he  R u s s i a ns  w e re  estimated  at  45,000  to  50,000  m e n;  their  loss  at  4,000  to 
6,000.  T h e se  dispatches  are  evidently  w r i t t en  in  the  full  flush  of  a  m a i d en 
victory.  T he  50,000  R u s s i a ns  p r e s e nt  on t he  A l ma contrast  very  strongly with 
the  45,000  troops  w h i ch  w e re  said  to  be  t he  m a x i m um  of  w h at w as  spread

T he  c o u n t ry  b e t w e en  the  Old  F o r t, w h e re  the allies landed, a nd  Sevastopol 
is  intersected by t h r ee w a t e r - c o u r s e s, forming, by their d e ep r a v i n e s,  as  m a ny 
military  positions.  T he  o ne  n e a r e st to  Sevastopol  is the T s h o r n a y a, e m p t y i ng 
itself  into  the  e a s t e rn  e nd  of  t he  b ay  of  Sevastopol.  While  F o rt  S e v e r n a ya 
defends  the  n o r t h e rn  shore  of  this  b a y,  t h at  rivulet,  or  r a t h er  its  deeply-cut 
valley  f o r ms  a  sort  of  natural  ditch  on  t he  east  of  t he  t o w n.  T h e r e,  t h e n,  is 
naturally  the  last  important  position  for  the  defense.  T he  n e xt  river  is  t he 
K a t s h a,  r u n n i ng  e a st  and  w e st  a  few  miles  to  t he  n o r th  of  S e v e r n a y a;  a nd 
again  a b o ut  twelve  miles  to  the  n o r t h w a rd  r u ns  the  A l m a.  Of the  t h r ee  lines 
of  defense,  in  spite  of  tactical  advantages  w h i ch m ay exist,  and w h i ch c a n n ot 
be  judged  at this  distance,  it is hardly to be  supposed that t he R u s s i a ns  should

of  S e v a s t o p ol  could  h a ve  b e en  decided.  T he  a b s e n ce  of  the  m a in  b o dy  of 
t he  allied  cavalry,  h o w e v e r,  might  h a ve  e n c o u r a g ed  t he  R u s s i a ns  to  send  a 
strong  corps  into  the  intrenchments  of  the  A l m a,  as  their  o wn  m o m e n t a ry 
superiority  in  t h at  a rm  would  secure  t h em  against  flank  m o v e m e n ts  of  t he 
hostile  h o r s e.  T he  impossibility  of  making u se  of this  arm  w h en o n ce  c o o p ed

T he  R u s s i an  defeat  on  the  A l ma  b e c o m es  still m o re  r e d u c ed  in its  tactical 
e x t e nt  w h en  more  closely  examined.  T he  Russians  are  not  fond  of  en 
trenching  t h e m s e l v es  in  o p en  walls.  T h ey  prefer,  w h e r e v er  t h ey  h a ve  time 
a nd  intend  furious  resistance,  closed  square  r e d o u b t s.  To  save  t he  artillery 
from  such  r e d o u b ts  is  impossible,  as  soon  as  the  assault  is  actually  carried 
through.  B ut  e v en  f r om  t h at  class  of  w o r k s,  technically  k n o wn  as  l u n e t t e s,

We  c o me  n ow  to  the  class  of  m o re  startling  n e ws  referring  to  the  capture

in  the  C r i m e a,  w e re  n ot  caught  with  the  rest. 

W h en  the  extraordinary  story  of  the  c a p t u re  of  S e v a s t o p ol  first  r e a c h ed

T he  actual  state  of the  land fortifications  of  S e v a s t o p ol is  too  little  k n o wn 
to  admit  of  any  positive  prognostication  as  to  h ow  long  that  fortress  m ay 
be  able  to  hold  o u t.  T he  s u c c e ss  on  the  A l ma  is  an  almost certain  indication 
t h at  the  place  will  be  t a k e n,  as  it  must  h a ve  raised  the  courage  a nd  spirit  of

15  m o st  dangerous  e n e my  t h ey  h a ve  to  deal  with  in t he  Crimea,  and  o ne  which

should  walk  into  Sevastopol  as  t h ey  w o u ld  into  a  coffee-house. 

After  the  great  mystification  of  the  c o n q u e st  of  the  place,  with  its  30,000 
killed  a nd  w o u n d ed  and  22,000  prisoners—a  mystification  w h o se  like  w as 
never  k n o wn  in  all  the  history  of  hoaxes—it  w o u ld  be  natural  to  e x p e ct  that 
the  real  official  d o c u m e n ts  w o u ld  at least p o s s e ss  the  merit of  affording clear 
and  positive  information  as  far  as  they  go.  Still  t he  r e p o rt  published  in 
L o n d on  on  t he  5th  of  O c t o b er  in  an  extraordinary  n u m b er  of  The  Gazette, 
and  copied  in o ur  columns  this  morning,  is,  after all, n ot free from  ambiguous 
expressions.  Indeed,  it is  most  o p en to  criticism—a c i r c u m s t a n ce  which  must 
be  ascribed  to  its  proceeding  from  L o rd  Stratford  de  Redcliffe,  o ne  of  the 
Palmerston  school  of  diplomacy.  This  dispatch,  in  t he  first  place,  purports 
to  h a ve  b e en  sent  to  England  from  B u c h a r e st  on  the  30th  of  S e p t e m b er  at 
3 V2  P.M.,  while  L o rd  Redcliffe  d a t es  it  from  Constantinople  on  t he  30th  at 
9V2  P . M .;  so  t h at  the  dispatch  purports  to  h a ve  b e en  actually  received  at 
B u c h a r e st  six h o u rs before  it w as  sent off from  Constantinople.  In the  second 
place,  the  dispatch  omits  all  mention  of  w h at  p a s s ed  in  t he  Crimea b e t w e en 
the  20th  and  28th  of  S e p t e m b e r,  telling us  t h at  " t he  allied  armies  established 
their  basis  of  operations  at  Balaklava  on  t he  morning  of  the  28th,  and  w e re

viously  stated  our  prima  facie  disbelief  in  t h e se  n u m b e r s,  and  h a ve  n e v er 
allowed  m o re  t h an  a b o ut  25,000  m en  to  Prince  Menchikoff,  disposable  for

T he  dispatch  next  p r o c e e ds  to  state  that  " t he  fortified  place  of  A n a pa has 
b e en  b u r n ed  by  the  Russians.  Its  garrison  was  marching  to  the  scene  of 
a c t i o n ."  We c a n n ot believe  this  n e ws  to be  true.  If  Prince  Menchikoff  e x p e c ts 
a ny  r e ë n f o r c e m e n ts  at  all  to  r e a ch  him  in  time,  t h ey  c an  do  so  m u ch  better 
from  P e r e k op  than  from  A n a p a,  w h i ch  is  nearly  t wo  h u n d r ed  miles  distant; 
if  n o ne  could  be  e x p e c t ed  by  him from  t he  former  place,  it  w o u ld  h a ve  b e en 
m o st  foolish,  by  calling  up  the  garrison  of  A n a p a,  on  t he  o t h er  side  of  the 
B l a ck  Sea,  to  sacrifice  in  addition to  Sevastopol  the  last  stronghold  u p on  t he 
C a u c a s u s.  It will  be  seen,  t h e n,  that with  all  the  " i n f o r m a t i o n"  of this official 
dispatch,  we  are  still  sent  b a ck  to  the  battle  of  t he  A l ma  as  the  chief  e v e nt 
w h o se  authenticity  m u st  be  admitted.  Of  this  event,  h o w e v e r,  the  details  are 
also  still  wanting,  and  the  D u ke  of  N e w c a s t le  has  n ow  w a r n ed  t he  British

C o r r e s p o n d e n ce  of  the  N . Y.  T r i b u n e. 

L o n d o n,  F r i d a y,  Oct. 6,  1854. 

It  is  impossible  to  describe the excitement and  suspense  of the  English during 
the  week.  On  S a t u r d ay  last  the  dispatch  about  t he  victory  of  t he  Alma  w as 
proclaimed  by  the  L o rd  M a y or  before  the  E x c h a n g e,  with  the  sound  of  the 
t r u m p e t;  b ut  t he  u n a u t h e n t i c a t ed  n e ws  of  the  fall  of  Sevastopol  spread  all 
over  the  country.  All  the  world  w as  taken  in.  N a p o l e on  a n n o u n c ed  it  to  his 
a r my  at  Boulogne,  the  English  and  F r e n ch  p a p e rs  c o n t a i n ed  leaders  on  the 
h a p py  e v e n t,  the  E m p e r or  of  Austria  congratulated  the  E m p e r or  and  the 
Q u e en  u p on  their  s u c c e s s,  b ut  cautiously  did  n ot  m e n t i on  S e v a s t o p o l;  bon 
fires  w e re  lighted,  and  t he  c a n n on  b o o m e d.  We  soon  o b t a i n ed  t he  dispatch 
w h i ch  originated  all  this  joy  and  exultation;  and  indeed  it p r o v ed  to  p r o c e ed 
from  a  v e ry  suspicious  source.  A  Tartar—that  is'to  say,  a T u r k i sh p o s t m a n-
h ad  arrived  at  B u c h a r e st  with  dispatches  from  Constantinople  for  O m er 
P a s h a,  w h i c h,  as  the  General  w as  absent,  h ad  to  be  sent  to  him  unopened— 
t h e r e f o re  we  d o n 't  k n ow  their  contents.  B ut  t he  p o s t m an  related  that  at  his 
d e p a r t u re  from  Constantinople  the  t o wn  w as  illuminated,  and  that  o r d e rs 
w e re  given  to  continue  t he  illumination  for  ten  d a y s.  He  c o n c l u d e d,  t h e r e 
fore,  t h at  Sevastopol  w as  taken,  and  gave  just  such  details  as  a  T u r k i sh  or 
L o n d on  p o s t b oy  could  give  in  a  p o t h o u s e.  He  m e n t i o n ed  18,000  R u s s i a ns 
killed,  b ut  only  200  guns  t a k e n,  though  the  forts  contain  a b o ve  500  g u n s; 
22,000  Russians  w e re  of  c o u r se  prisoners,  since  it w as  k n o wn t h at the  garri 
son  a m o u n t ed  to  about 40,000.  T he  fleet w as  first t a k e n;  t h en  again  a portion 
of  it  w as  destroyed,  and  Prince  Menchikoff  w as  on  t he  point  of  blowing 
himself  up  w i th  t he  remainder,  etc.,  e t c.  B ut  it  r e m a i n ed  r a t h er  curious  that

the  Consul  at  B u c h a r e s t,  and  that  no  dispatch  h ad  r e a c h ed  the  F r e n ch 
G o v e r n m e n t.  Still,  the  n e ws  w as  t oo good not to be believed,  and accordingly 
it w as  believed.  N e xt  day,  it  is t r u e, there  arrived  a r e p o rt from  St. P e t e r s b u rg 
mentioning  a  dispatch  of  Prince  Menchikoff  of  t he  26th,  w h i ch  s h o w ed  that 
after  the  battle  of  the  A l ma  he  w as  retreating t o w a rd  S y m p h e r o p o l.  Still the 
p a p e rs  believed  t h at  it  w as  a  misprint,  and  t h at  t he  real  date  of  t he  dispatch 
w as  the  20th,  rather  t h an  to  give  up  the  agreeable  delusion  of  the  fall  of 
Sevastopol  at  the  first  onset.  To-day,  h o w e v e r,  h as  brought  t he  English 
public  to  r e a s o n;  the  miraculous  c a p t u re  of  a  great  fortress  without  a  siege 
p r o v es  to  h a ve  b e en a cruel  h o a x,  which  will  m a ke  the  p a p e rs  more  cautious 
in  future. 

In  Spain  disturbances  h a ve  t a k en  place  n ot  only  in  Malaga,  w h e re  the 
Republican  party,  as  I  r e m a r k ed  in  my  last  letter,  is  v e ry  strong,  but  e v en 
in  L o g r o ñ o,  w h e re  E s p a r t e ro  resided  for  m a ny  y e a r s;  and  in  J a e n,  the  tele-
graph  a d d s,  that  a  Republican  conspiracy  has  b e en  discovered,  a nd  that t he 
Infant  D on  E n r i q u e,  the b r o t h er of the  idiotic h u s b a nd  of the  Q u e e n,  has  b e en 
exiled  to  the  Balearic  Islands.  Still  the  e x c i t e m e nt  a b o ut  Sevastopol  is  so 
great  that  n o b o dy  p a ys  attention  to  Spain. 

In  D e n m a rk  the  Diet  w as  o p e n ed  on  the  2d.  T he  royal  speech  from  the 
t h r o ne  b r e a t h es  defiance  to  the  Assembly.  It  w as  received  by  hisses  and  by 
h e a r ty  c h e e rs  for  t he  Constitution.  T he  Frankfort  Journal  reiterates  t he 
statement  that  t he  allied  p o w e rs  h a ve  resolved  to  reconsider  the  famous 
treaty  of  the  8th  of  M a y,  1852,  by  w h i ch  the  succession to  t he  Danish  throne 
was  eventually  m a de  over to  the  E m p e r or  of  Russia.  U r q u h a rt has  not c e a s ed 
to  bring  this  discreditable  piece  of  E u r o p e an  diplomacy  before  the  public 
over  a nd  over  again,  a nd  his  e n d e a v o rs  s e em  n ow  at last to  h a ve  s u c c e e d e d. 
T he  object  of  this  m o v e m e n t,  if  t h e re  be  anything  in  the  r u m o r,  is  simply 
by  reopening  t he  question  to  get  Prussia,  w ho  dissented  from  t h at  protocol, 
to  ally  herself  with  the  w e s t e rn  p o w e r s.  It is  w o r t hy  of  n o te  that P a l m e r s t on 
called  the  protocol,  like  the  treaty  of  1840,  m e a s u r es  against  Russia,  while 
its  suspension  is  n ow  to  be  considered  as  an  act of  hostility t o w a rd Russia. 

Austria is r e p o r t ed to h a ve  sent a n o te to  St.  P e t e r s b u r g,  offering o n ce  more 
the  four  conditions  as  the  basis  of  p e a c e,  and  declaring  t h at  the  refusal  of 
the  Czar  to  accept  t h em  will  be  t a k en  for  a  c a s us  belli  by  Francis  Joseph. 

35  This  is  o ne  of  the  results  of  the  victories  in  the  Crimea. 

T he  following  o b s e r v a t i o ns  on  a  r e c e nt  article  in  The  Economist are  t a k en 

from  the  t r a de  circular  of  M e s s r s.  Smith  & Charles: 

"Of  all  the  a n n o u n c e m e n ts  or  intimations  that h a ve  a p p e a r ed  since  the w ar 
began,  t h at  put  forth  on  S a t u r d ay  last  by  The  Economist  is  by  far  the  m o st 
i m p o r t a nt  in  a  R u s s o - c o m m e r c i al  point  of  view.  It  must  be  borne  in  mind 
that  this  weekly  journal  is 

the  property  of  one  of  the  Secretaries  to  the

Karl  Marx/Friedrich  Engels 

Treasury (Mr. Wilson)  and hence  the remarks  to  which  we  are  about  to  draw 
attention  may  be  regarded  as  semi-official.  H a v i ng  explained  t he  c o u r se  of 
e x c h a n ge  in  P e t e r s b u r g,  and  s h o wn  that,  as  a  c o n s e q u e n ce  of  o ur  t r a de  with 
Prussia,  British  gold  must  necessarily  be  furnished  by  this  c o u n t ry  to  R u s s ia 
for  its  belligerent  p u r p o s e s;  having  stated  that  this  w as  all  f o r e s e en  by  our 
G o v e r n m e n t,  b ut  t h at  t h ey  considered  such  a  state  of  things  t he  lesser of t wo 
evils,  The  Economist  p r o c e e ds  to  say,  that  after  the  fall  of  S e v a s t o p ol  ' we 
shall  be  in  undisturbed  possession  of  the  Black  S ea  a nd  its  s h o r e s,  and 
m a s t e rs  of  t he  D a n u b e.  B ut  in the  meantime  Russia m ay t a ke  a p o s t u re w h i ch 
we  c an  n e v er  by  our  a r ms  reach,  in  t he  h o pe  of  wearying  t he  patience  of 
E n g l a n d,  as  in  such  a  p o s t u re  Russia  can  only  be  r e a c h ed  by  her  t r a d e,  and 
it  m ay  b e c o me  a  question  w h e t h er  our  national  interests  will  n ot  dictate 
before  long  a  different  policy  from  that  we  h a ve  hitherto  followed.  We  shall 
find  that  we  b l o c k a de  t he  p o r ts  in  vain,  so long as  our p r o d u ce finds  a r e a dy

can be  so  easily e v a d e d, e tc 
If,  therefore,  considerations  of  general policy 
shall  r e n d er  it  needful  again  to  consider  t he  question  of  t he  e x t e nt  to  which 
the  blockade  shall  be  enforced  and  the  trade  restricted  by  land  as  well  as 
by  sea,'  e t c.  The  Economist  concludes  with  a  m o st  s o l e mn  warning,  saying: 
'It  will  be  well  for  those  w ho  are  disposed  to  engage  in  s u ch  h a z a r d o us 
u n d e r t a k i n gs  (as  supplying  t he  Russians  with  capital  to  p u r c h a se  goods  in 
the  winter,  to  be  f o r w a r d ed  to  this  country  n e xt year)  to  consider  that  it m ay 
be  found  needful  to  p u r s ue  a  v e ry  different  policy  in  t he  second  y e ar  of  a 
Russian  campaign,  from  t h at which w as  wisest  and  b e st in t he first.' We need 
hardly  point  out  that  t he  u p s h ot  of  all  this  (and  we  strongly  r e c o m m e nd  our 
friends  carefully to  consider the entire article) is, t h at the Allied P o w e rs h a ve 
determined—as  t he  only  w ay  of  bringing  t he  w ar  to  a  close—to  prohibit  t he 
overland  traffic  n e xt  y e a r;  and  to  p r e v e nt  capitalists  from  e m b a r k i ng  in  a 
t r a de  which  will  t h en  be  prohibited,  t he  G o v e r n m e nt has  v e ry considerately 
allowed  o ne  of  the  Secretaries  of  the  T r e a s u ry  to  m a ke  k n o wn  their  in-

T he  official  a c c o u n ts  of  the  battle  of  the  A l ma  h a ve  finally  arrived,  and  the 
dispatches  of  the  c o m m a n d e r s,  the  reports  of  English  journalists  w ho  w e re

this  morning,  confirming  in  every  important r e s p e ct t he conclusions we d r ew 
from  the  first  telegraphic  r e p o r ts  of  the  action.  T he  following  are  the  facts 
as  t h ey  a p p e ar  to  h a ve  o c c u r r e d: 

A b o ut  t h r ee  miles  from  the  coast,  the  river  Alma  m a k es  a  b e nd  so  as  to 
f o rm  a crescent,  the t wo h o r ns  of which point t o w a rd t he  N o r t h.  T he  s o u t h e rn 
side  of  the  river,  generally  formed  by  cliffs  about  300  feet  high,  h e re  offers 
an  amphitheater  sloping  d o w n,  more  or  less  gently,  t o w a rd  t he  stream.  This 
slope,  supported  on  the  right  and  left by  a b r u pt  high  cliffs  forming the  edges 
of  t he  plateau,  w as  selected  by  the  Russians  as  their  position.  If  repulsed, 
their  superior  cavalry  could  always  cover  the  r e t r e at  on  t he  level  ground  of

T he  battle  a p p e a rs  to  h a ve  b e en  distinguished  by  the  feature,  that  its  first 
phase—that  of  skirmishing  along  the  w h o le  line,  while  t he  real  decisive 
m a n e u v e rs  are  carried  on  b e h i nd  this  covering  curtain—was  v e ry  m u ch

T he  b r a v e ry  of  t he  allied  t r o o ps  a p p e a rs  to  h a ve  b e en  v e ry  great.  T h e re 
are  few  e x a m p l es  of  a battle  consisting,  like  this,  of  an  almost  uninterrupted, 
slow  b ut  steady  a d v a n c e,  and  offering  n o ne  of  the  vicissitudes  a nd  incidents 
which  give  s u ch  a  dramatic  interest  to  most  other  great  battles.  T h is  single 
fact  is  sufficient  to  p r o ve  at  least  a  considerable  numerical  superiority  on 
t he  part  of  t he  allies,  and  to  show  that  t he  allied  Generals  in  their  r e p o r ts

T he  generalship  of  the  allies  w as  good,  b ut  s h o ws  m o re  confidence  in t he 
valor  of  their  t r o o ps  and  t he  assistance  of  t he  fleet  t h an  in  t he  inventive 
capacities  of  t he  Generals  themselves.  It w a s,  so  to  say,  a plain,  homely  sort 
of  battle,  of  a  purely tactical n a t u r e, destitute in a r a re d e g r ee of all  strategical 
features.  T he  flank  m a n e u v er  of  B o s q u et  w as  a  v e ry  natural  c o n c e p t i o n,  and

As  to  the  forces  engaged,  the  allies  had  u n d er  fire  t h r ee  F r e n ch  and  four 
English  divisions,  beside  their  artillery,  leaving  o ne  F r e n ch  a nd  o ne  English 
division  and  all  the  cavalry,  in  r e s e r v e,  b e s i d es  eight  T u r k i sh  battalions, 
which  w e re  sent  to  support  B o s q u e t,  b ut  arrived  after  t he  close  of t he  action. 
10  N o w,  the  F r e n ch  having  left  stronger  d e t a c h m e n ts  and  suffered  greater 
losses  at  V a r na t h an t he British, t he  divisions  m ay be  considered  almost equal 
on  the  day  of  the  battle—the  F r e n ch  a b o ut  6,000,  the  British  a b o ut  5,500 
strong,  each.  This  would  give  an 
infantry  force  actually  engaged  of 
40,000  infantry,  w i th  a  r e s e r ve  of  a b o ut  16,000  m e n,  including  the  T u r k s, 
15  w h i ch  a p p e a rs  to  agree with t he  statements  as  to t he force  of t he  expedition, 
deducting  for  the  sick  and  for  d e t a c h m e n t s.  T he  R u s s i a ns  are  stated  by 
Marshal  St.  A r n a ud  to  h a ve  m u s t e r ed  t wo  divisions  of t he  line,  t he  16th a nd 
17th,  with  t wo  brigades  of  r e s e r v e,  (soldiers  on  furlough,  recalled  to  duty,) 
t he  14th and  13th, b e s i de t he  6th battalion of rifles.  This force w o u ld c o m p r i se 
forty-nine  battalions  if  the  brigades  had  the full n u m b er  of battalions.  E v e ry 
battalion  counting  700  m en  (they  h a ve  n e v er  m u s t e r ed  stronger  in  this  war, 
although  in  t he  H u n g a r i an  w ar  t h ey  w e re  fifty  m en  stronger,)  would  give  a 
total  of  34,300  men.  B ut  the  a b o ve  are  a b o ut  as  m a ny  regular  land  t r o o ps 
as  we  k n ew  to  be  in  and  a b o ut  S e v a s t o p o l,  and  it  is  m o st  likely  t h at  five  or 
six  battalions  at  least  w e re  left  behind  as  a  garrison  in  t h at  fortress.  This 
w o u ld  bring  the  R u s s i a ns  to  a  strength  of  30,000  infantry,  w h i ch  m ay  h a ve

6,000  s a b r e s,  b ut of  c o u r se  a  good  n u m b er  of t h em w e re m e re C o s s a c k s. This 
m a r k ed  superiority  of  t he  allies  deprives  t he  victory  of  t h at  excessive  glory 
30  w h i c h,  as  o ur  r e a d e rs  will  see  in  our  e x t r a c ts  from  the  English p a p e r s,  it is 
attempted  to  attach  to  it.  T he  b r a v e ry  a p p e a rs  to  h a ve  b e en  equal  on  b o th 
sides;  a nd  certainly  the  allied  generals,  w e re  t h ey  e v er  so  flushed  with  vic 
tory,  never  thought  of  marching  into  S e v a s t o p ol  after their  success,  without 
any  further  delay  or  opposition,  b a n n e rs  flying  a nd  b a n ds  playing.

T he  result  of  the  battle,  t h o u gh  morally  great  for  t he  allies,  c an  hardly 
p r o d u ce  any  profound  dejection  in  t he  R u s s i an  a r m y.  It  is  a retreat like  t h at 
of  L ü t z en or  B a u t z e n;  and  if  Menchikoff,  from  his  flanking position  at B a k s hi 
Sarai,  u n d e r s t a n ds  as  well  h ow  to  d r aw  t he  allies  after  him  as  Blücher  did 
before  the  battle  of  the  K a t z b a c h,  t h ey  m ay  y et  learn  that  such  fruitless 
victories  are  of  no  great  u se  to t he  gainer.  Menchikoff is  yet in force  at their 
rear,  and  till  t h ey  h a ve  defeated  him  a  s e c o nd  time  and  entirely  driven  him

a w a y,  he  will  still  be  formidable.  Almost  everything  n ow  will  d e p e nd  u p on 
the  arrival  of  r e ë n f o r c e m e n ts  of  the  allied  r e s e r ve  on  o ne  h a n d,  and  of  the 
R u s s i an  t r o o ps  from  P e r e k o p,  K e r t sh  and  A n a pa  on  the  other.  W h o e v er  is 
first the  stronger,  m ay  strike  a great blow.  B ut Menchikoff  h as  this  advantage 
t h at  he  c an  at  any  time  elude  an  attack  by  falling  b a c k,  while  t he  allies  are 
tied  to  t he  spot  w h e re  are  their  d é p ô t s,  c a m ps  and  p a r k s. 

F or  t he  m o m e n t,  Sevastopol,  though  invested  on  o ne  side,  a p p e a rs  safe, 
t he  superiority  of  t he  Allies  not  being  marked  e n o u gh  to  m a ke  front  in  t wo 
directions.  B ut  should  their  r e s e r ve  of  20,000  m en  arrive  s o o n er  t h an  M e n-
chikoff's  supports,—as  a p p e a rs  almost  certain  from  our  dispatch  by  the 
Niagara,  received  last  night  by  telegraph  from  Halifax—a  few  d a ys  m ay 
decide  m u c h.  A  place  like  Sevastopol,  if  o n ce  seriously  a nd  vigorously 
attacked,  c a n n ot  be  e x p e c t ed  to  hold  out  a  fortnight  against  o p en  t r e n c h e s. 
T he  r e s e r ve  h ad  all  sailed  from  V a r na  and  should  h a ve  arrived  by  t he  4th 
or  5th,  t h o u gh  our  Halifax  dispatch  does  not  m e n t i on  their  arrival;  at  any 
r a te  b e f o re  t he  16th  or  18th,  therefore,  Sevastopol  c an  hardly  be  e x p e c t ed 
to  fall.  T h e re  are  c h a n c es  that  an  active  campaign  in  the  o p en  field  might 
prolong  its  holding  out  for  some  time  longer;  b ut  u n l e ss  Menchikoff,  with 
his  m o v e a b le  a r my  in  the  rear  of  the  allies,  should  gain  s o me  important 
advantage  in  the  field,  or unless  sickness  decimates t he  allied t r o o p s,  it  must 
certainly  fall.  B ut  we  m ay  be  sure,  from  the  p r e p a r a t i o ns  a nd  t e m p er  of  the 
R u s s i a ns  that  it  will  n ot  be  t a k en  without  d e s p e r a te  r e s i s t a n c e,  a nd  terrible 
b l o o d s h e d;  the  sanguinary  details  of  the  battle  on  the  A l ma will  certainly  be 
e x c e e d ed  in  their  kind  by  t h o se  of  t he  storm  and  c a p t u re  of  Sevastopol.

N e xt  to  the  battle  of  the  Alma,  the  principal  a c h i e v e m e nt ot t he  Allies  in t he 
Crimea  has  b e en  L o rd  Raglan's  f a m o us  f l a nk  m a r ch  from  the  A l ma  to 
Balaklava,  by  w h i ch  he  changed  the  a p p a r e nt  object  of  the  campaign  from 
t he  c a p t u re  a nd  o c c u p a t i on  of  Sevastopol  to  a  coup  de  main  against  a por 
tion,—and  t he  w e a k er  portion,  too,—of the fortifications,  including,  of  c o u r s e, 
t he  destruction  of  t he  Russian  fleet,  d o c k y a r ds  and  arsenals,  but  involving 
the  withdrawal  of  the  allied  forces  as  soon  as  this  object  should  be  attained. 
T h at  such  m u st  be  the  c a s e,  w as  plain, from t he entire  m o v e m e nt in question. 
It  w as  an  a b a n d o n m e nt  of  the  idea  of  attacking  the  n o r t h e rn  front  of  the 
f o r t r e s s,  w h i ch  is  the  c o m m a n d i ng  front,  w h e re  alone  an  a t t a ck could  really 
be  decisive;  and  thus  it w as  a p a t e nt  confession of  i n c o m p e t e n ce  on  the  p a rt 
of  t he  expedition  to  accomplish  w h at  w as  laid  d o wn  in  its  programme,—the 
complete  capture  and  o c c u p a t i on of  the  place.  N e v e r t h e l e s s,  as  we  said,  this 
v e ry  m a r ch  h as  b e en  glorified  as  a  most  brilliant  stroke  of  generalship 
t h r o u gh  columns  on  columns  of  high-sounding p h r a s es  and rhetorical gibber 
ish;  a nd  e v en the  great journals  of  L o n d o n,  with  their  c o r r e s p o n d e n ts  on  t he 
spot,  did  n ot  discover  the  t r u th  till  a  m o n th  afterward,  w h en t he  G o v e r n m e nt 
s e e ms  to  h a ve  given  t h em  a  hint  of  it.  T h u s,  The  London  Times  of  Oct. 28, 
for  the  first time  opening its  e y es  to the true  state of the c a s e, gently indicates 
t h at  t he  minor  object  of  the  campaign  m ay  be  t he  only  o ne  accomplished, 
and  that  the  forts  on  the  n o r th  side  of  the  b a y,  if  they  do  not  voluntarily 
surrender,  c an  hardly  be  t a k e n.  B ut  The  Times  h o p es  t h ey  will  b e h a ve 
respectably,  and  surrender,  i n a s m u ch  as  all  d e p e n d e nt  fortifications  ought 
to  give  in  w h en  o n ce  t he  main  b o dy  of  the  place  is  taken.  B ut  t he  t r u th is,

It  is  t r ue  t h at  since  the  "glorious  m a r c h" in question nothing h as b e en d o ne 
by  t he  Allies  of  which  a n y b o dy  could  boast  m u c h,  and,  t h e r e f o r e,  our  t r a n s 
atlantic  c o t e m p o r a r i es  are  not  to  blame  for  making  the  m o st of  it.  As  for  the 
siege  itself  so  far  as  it  h as  p r o c e e d e d,  it  is  o ne  of t h o se things  of  w h i ch t h ey 
m ay  well  think  that  the  less  said  the  better.  B ut  as  we  are  b o u nd  to  nothing 
b ut  impartiality  in  t he  p r e m i s e s,  we  shall  not be  so  delicate.  T he  t r u th is  that 
the  w ar  in  general  being  an  exceedingly  curious  w a r,  this  siege  is  o ne  of  its 
most  curious  points.  T he  great  feature  of  t he  w ar  a p p e a rs  to  be  a belief  t h at 
field-works  are  impregnable.  First  at  Oltenitza,  the  old-fashioned  w ay  of 
c a n n o n a d i ng  was  e m p l o y ed  for  a  couple  of  h o u rs  and  t h en  t he  w o r ks  w e re 
s t o r m ed  b ut  w i t h o ut  s u c c e s s.  At  Kalafat  the  Russians  did  not  e v en  d a re  to 
m a ke  an  attack.  At  Silistria  a  mere  e a r t h - w o rk b o re  t he  b r u nt  of  t he  battle, 
a nd  held  out,  e v en  w h en  almost  leveled,  against  the  frantic  onslaught of  the 
e n e m y.  N ow  at  S e v a s t o p ol  a  simple  line  of field-works  is  h o n o r ed  with m o re 
extensive  breaching  batteries,  and  with  far  heavier  artillery,  t h an  w e re  e v er 
brought  to  b e ar  against t he  most regular fortress.  This  siege is  a striking proof 
of  t he  fact  t h at  in  t he  same  proportion  as  the  material  of  w a r f a re  h a s,  by 
industrial  p r o g r e s s,  a d v a n c ed  during  the  long  p e a c e,  in  t he  same  proportion 
has  the  art  of  w ar  degenerated.  A  N a p o l e o n,  on  seeing  t he  batteries  b e f o re 
S e v a s t o p o l,  bristling  with  eight  and  ten-inch  g u n s,  w o u ld  b u r st  out  in  a  fit 
of  irresistible  laughter.  B ut  this  is  not  the  w h o le  story  by  a  great  deal. 

A b o ut  the  1st  of  O c t o b e r,  t he  Allies  w e re  in  position,  b ut  it  w as  n ot  till 
t he  8th  or  9th  that  t he  first  ground  w as  b r o k e n,  a nd  fire  w as  n ot  o p e n ed  till 
the  17th.  T he  r e a s on  of  this  delay  w as  that  the  g u ns  could  n ot  be  brought 
up  sooner.  T h e re  w e re  only four  or five  miles  of g r o u nd to  go  over—all good, 
h a rd  soil,  w i th  little  undulation,  and  p a rt  of  it  a  p a s s a b le  r o a d.  B ut  t h ey  had 
no  draught  cattle.  No  draught  cattle  in  the  Crimea—the  richest  c o u n t ry  for 
cattle  in  the  w h o le  w o r l d!  W h y,  t h e re  w e re  m o re  bullocks  in  t he  valley  of 
Baidar,  within  sight  from  t he  hights  of  the  C h e r n a y a,  t h an  w o u ld h a ve  b e en 
required  to  drag  all  the  united  fleet  across  the  hills.  B ut the  valley of  Baidar 
w as  o p en to  t he  C o s s a c k s,  and t he allied cavalry, in protecting a razzia,  might 
be  e x p o s ed  to  t h e se  formidable  o p p o n e n t s.  B e s i d e s,  the  Allies  m u st k e ep  on 
good  t e r ms  with  t he  inhabitants,  and  not  seize  their  p r o p e r t y.  With  s u ch 
e x c u s e s,  our  English  cotemporaries  seek  to  hide  t he  t r u th  t h at  Raglan  and 
C a n r o b e r t,  while  blockading  Sevastopol  on t he  south,  are t h e m s e l v es block-

W h en  the  landing  w as  first  r e p o r t e d,  we  said  that  disease  w o u ld  be  the 
w o r st  e n e my  of  t he  Allies  if  t he  campaign  should  be  lengthened.  D i s e a se  is 
t h e re  in  its  w o r st f o r m s,  coupled,  at least  as  far  as  the  British  are  c o n c e r n e d, 
with  t he  v e ry  w o r st  sort  of  a t t e n d a n c e.  I n d e e d,  to  s u ch  an  extent  h a ve  t he 
sick  b e en  neglected  from  this  c a u s e,  t h at  L o rd  Raglan  has  b e en  obliged  to 
issue  a  v e ry  p e r e m p t o ry  r e p r i m a nd  to  t he  medical  staff.  But  this  is  not  all. 
T he  d o c t o rs  are  at  Constantinople,  t he  medical  stores  at V a r n a,  and  the  sick 
at  Balaklava.  Is  not  this  a  splendid  illustration  of  t he  n ew  military  doctrine 
lately  held  forth  by  L o u is  B o n a p a r te  at  B o u l o g n e,  that  e v e ry  army,  to  h a ve 
a  g o od  position,  must  be  placed  in  a  triangle?  T he  sickness  increases  with 
the  r o u g h n e ss  of the  season, the regiments dwindle down—a British regiment, 
sent  out  1,000  strong,  n ow  c a n n ot  c o u nt  m o re  t h an  600  m en u n d er  arms—and 
t he  slowness  of  operations  goes  on  its  e v en  c o u r s e.  T he  routine  of  t he  H o r se 
G u a r d s,  t he  fruit  of  forty  y e a r s'  peaceful  schooling,  is  n ot  to  be  u p s et  by 
trifles  of  that  sort.  Perish  the  a r m y,  b ut  let  Sevastopol  be  t a k en  according 
to  H er  Majesty's  regulations! 

In  c o m m on  sieges  t he  besiegers  usually  try  to  place  their  first  batteries 
as  near  as  possible  to  t he  e n e m y 's  w o r k s,  a nd  six  or  seven  h u n d r ed  y a r ds 
is  considered  a  great  distance.  B ut  in  a  grand  siege  like  this,  particularly  if 
against  m e re  field-works,  just  t he  r e v e r se  should  be  d o n e,  according  to 
30  Raglan.  T he  e n e my  allows  us  to  c o me  within  s e v en  h u n d r ed  y a r d s,  b ut  we 
m u st  never  do  w h at  the  e n e my  w a n ts  us  to  d o.  So  says  Raglan,  a nd  o p e ns 
his  batteries  at  2,500  a nd  3,000  y a r ds  distance—a  f a ct  we  could  n ot  believe 
did  t he  r e p o r ts  leave  it  possible  to  doubt.  N e xt  he  c o m es  d o wn  to  1,500  a nd 
1,200  y a r d s,  a nd  t h en  states,  as  a  r e a s on  for  n ot  opening fire,  t h at b r e a c h i ng 
batteries,  to  be  effective,  must  be  within  t h r ee  or  four  h u n d r ed  y a r ds  from 
the  w o r ks  to  be  b r e a c h e d!  T he  distant  batteries  are  to  h a ve  L a n c a s t er  a nd 
long-range  ten-inch  g u n s,  since  it  s e e ms  t he  British  artillerists  are  of  opinion 
t h at  t h e se  guns  are  like  t e l e s c o p e s,  only  good  at  a great  distance.  I n d e e d, this 
long-range  question,  which  is  perfectly  in its  place  for  naval  a r m a m e n t s,  has 
c a u s ed  m o re  confusion  and  h u m b ug  t h an  real  good  w h en  applied  to  land 
artillery;  we  h a ve  an  e x a m p le  of  it  in  t h e se  ridiculous  batteries.

T he  l a n d w a rd  fortifications  of  Sevastopol,  w h i ch h a ve  p r o v o k ed  all  t h e se 
o u t b u r s ts  of  genius  a nd  perspicacity,  are  as  follows:  On  t he  w e s t e rn  side 
(attacked  by  t he  F r e n c h)  o ne  or  t wo  faces  of  the  Q u a r a n t i ne  F o rt  are  e x 
p o s e d.  Behind  this  is  a  loopholed  wall  running  up  t o w a rd  t he  h e ad  of  t he 
Q u a r a n t i ne  B a y,  and  ending  on  a  hill,  in  a  round  t o w er  which  forms  a  réduit 
for  an  e a r t h - w o rk  c o n s t r u c t ed  around  it.  T h e n ce  a  wall  of  t h r ee  feet  average 
thickness  is  continued  to  the  u p p er  end  of  the  harbor,  t h us  inclosing  S e v a s 
topol  on  t he  south-west.  This  wall  is  said  to  be  incapable  of  a ny  defense, 
although it might easily h a ve b e en m a de  so ; it is, t h e r e f o r e, p r o t e c t ed by  small 
e a r t h - w o r ks  lying  in  front  of  it.  F r om  the  e nd  of  t he  h a r b or  e a s t w a rd  to  t he 
Careening  B ay  (the  British  front  of  attack)  there  are  no  regular  defenses

similar  m a n n er  with  the  o ne  described  a b o v e.  T h e re  are  b e s i d es  s o me  earth 
w o r ks  of  irregular  form,  t he  whole  forming  an  e n t r e n c h ed  c a mp  of  no  great

s k e t c h ed  on  t he  spot.  At  all  events  t h ey  show  only  o ne  line  of  defenses, 
consisting  of  w o r ks  o p en  in  the  r e a r;  there  are  no  closed r e d o u b t s,  of w h i ch 
as  a  general  thing  t he  Russians  are  so  exceedingly  fond.  B ut  we  c a n n ot 
believe t h at this  is  t he  c a s e;  if this w as  the  only line to  t a k e,  the  British ought 
long  since  to  h a ve  t a k en  it  with  the  b a y o n e t.  T h e re  m u st  be  a  s e c o nd  line 
of  r e d o u b ts  behind  it. 

T he  whole  of  the  Russian  w o r ks  have  b e en  a r m ed  w i th  h e a vy  guns  from 
t he  fleet—the  b e st  use  t he  Russians  could  m a ke  of  t h e m.  Y et  their  practice

3,000  y a r d s.  After  t h r ee  d a y s'  b o m b a r d m e nt  by  t he  allied  fleets  and  armies, 
it  is  stated  t h at  the  British,  on  their  side,  had  m a de  o ne  b r e a c h,  while  the 
F r e n ch  h ad  not  yet  c o m p l e t ed  theirs.  As  soon  as  this  w as  c o m p l e t e d,  t he

O ur  r e a d e rs  c a n n ot  but  be  struck  with  the  novel  spirit  breathing  through  the 
intelligence  from  t he  seat  of  w ar  in  t he  Crimea,  received  by  t he  Baltic 
y e s t e r d a y,  a nd  published  in  o ur  columns  this  morning.  Hitherto  an  over-
5  w e e n i ng  and  arrogant  confidence  h as  distinguished  t he  c o m m e n ts  of  t he 
British  p r e s s,  and  the  r e p o r ts  of  British  a nd  F r e n ch  c o r r e s p o n d e n ts  con 
cerning t he  m o v e m e n ts  and  p r o s p e c ts  of  t he  war.  But n ow this h as given w ay 
to  a  feeling  of  anxiety  and  e v en  of  alarm.  It  is  confessed  on  all  h a n ds  t h at 
t h e re  is  no  such  superiority  as  has  b e en  claimed  on  t he  p a rt  of  t he  allied 
armies  over  their  antagonists.  T h at  Sevastopol  is  stronger,  Menchikoff  an 
abler  General,  and  his  a r my  far  m o re  formidable  t h an  was  s u p p o s e d;  a nd 
t h at instead of  certain and decisive  victory, t he  F r e n ch and  English n ow  stand 
e x p o s ed  to  possible  failure  and  disgrace.  S u ch  is  the  feeling  e x p r e s s ed  by 
o ur  c o r r e s p o n d e nt  at  Liverpool,  himself  an  Englishman,  alive  to  all  t he 
patriotic  impulses  and  prejudices  of  his  c o u n t r y;  and  this  feeling  is  equally 
manifested  by  the  v e ry  energetic  action  of  b o th  the  F r e n ch  and  English 
G o v e r n m e n t s.  D e s p e r a te  efforts  are  making  to  h u r ry  r e ë n f o r c e m e n ts  to 
S e v a s t o p o l;  the  United  K i n g d om  is  drained  of  its  last  soldier;  m a ny  steam 
ships  are  t a k en  up  as  t r a n s p o r t s;  and  50,000  F r e n ch  t r o o ps  are  sent forward, 
all  in  the  h o pe  of  arriving  at  t he  scene  of  action  b e f o re  it  shall  be  too  late 
to  t a ke  p a rt  in  t he  final,  decisive  struggle.

We  published  on  S a t u r d ay  a  copious  quantity  of  d o c u m e n t s,  relating 
principally  to  t he  earlier  stages  of  t he  siege,  and  t he  partially  effective  b ut 
y et  disastrous  cooperation  of  the  fleets;  and  we  n ow  add  the  official  r e p o r ts

Liverpool  c o r r e s p o n d e n t.  We  do  not  think  t h at  t h ey  are  in  danger  of  a ny 
w o r se  disaster  t h an  a  c o m p u l s o ry  retreat  and embarkation.  A n d,  on t he  o t h er 
h a n d,  t h e re  is  still  the  possibility  of  their  carrying  the  t o wn  by  a  d e s p e r a te 
a nd  sanguinary  assault.  But  h o w e v er  this  m ay  b e,  it  must,  we  think,  be 
decided  long  before  the  r e ë n f o r c e m e n ts  leaving  F r a n ce  and  England  c an 
r e a ch  t he  Crimea.  T he  campaign  is  evidently  n e ar  its  turning  point;  t he 
m o v e m e n t s,  the  e r r o rs  and  the  omissions  w h i ch  h a ve  shaped  its  c h a r a c t er 
a nd  g e n e r a t ed  its  results,  are  m a d e;  we  are  in  p o s s e s s i on  of  authentic  a nd 
indisputable  information  as  to  the  principal  facts;  and  we  accordingly  p r o 
p o se  succinctly  a nd  briefly  to  review  the  c o u r se  of  t he  contest. 

It  is  n ow  established  that  w h en  the  allies  landed  at  Old  F o r t,  Menchikoff 
h ad  u n d er  his  c o m m a nd  in  the  field  only  forty-two  battalions  and  t wo  regi 
m e n ts  of  cavalry,  besides  some  C o s s a c k s,  while  S e v a s t o p ol  w as  garrisoned 
by  the  marines  a nd  sailors  of  the  fleet.  T h e se  forty-two  battalions  w e re  of 
the  12th,  16th  and  17th  divisions  of  infantry;  and  supposing  e a ch battalion 
to  h a ve  h ad  its  full  c o m p l e m e nt  of  700  men,  t h e re  w e re  in  all  29,400  m en  of 
infantry;  w i th  2,000  H u s s a r s,  t he  C o s s a c k s,  artillery,  s a p p e rs  and m i n e r s;  in 
all  s o me  32,000  m en  in  t he  field.  With  t h e se he  could  n ot  o p p o se  t he  landing 
of  the  allies,  as  by  so  doing  he  would  h a ve  e x p o s ed  his  t r o o p s,  w i t h o ut  a 
sufficient  r e s e r v e,  to  t he  fire  of  t he  allied  fleets.  A  powerful  a r m y,  w h i ch 
could  afford  to  h a ve  sacrificed  a  part  of  its  strength,  might  h a ve  d e t a c h ed 
a force  to  o p en  a p e t ty  w ar of  surprises  and night-attacks  against t he  invaders 
while  landing;  t he  R u s s i a n s,  in  this  instance, required e v e ry m an for t he great 
battle  to  c o m e;  b e s i d e s,  t he  Russian foot  soldier  is  t he  clumsiest fellow  alive 
for  p e t ty  w ar  o p e r a t i o n s;  his  forte  is  the  action  in  c o l u mn  by  close  o r d e r. 
As  to  t he  C o s s a c k s,  on  t he  other  hand,  their  m o de  of  w a r f a re  is  t oo  p e t t y, 
and  is  effective  in  proportion  only  as  the  c h a n ce  of  plunder  i n c r e a s e s. 
B e s i d e s,  t he  campaign  of  t he  Crimea  seems  to  p r o ve  t h at  t he  regularization 
of  t he  C o s s a c k s, w h i ch has  b e en gradually carried o ut for  the last thirty y e a r s, 
h as  b r o k en  their  individual  spirit  of  enterprise,  and  r e d u c ed  t h em  to  a  sub- 
dued  condition,  in  w h i ch  they  are  spoiled  for  irregular  a nd  n ot  y et  fit  for 
regular  service.  T h ey  s e em  incapable  n ow  either  of  o u t p o st  a nd  d e t a c h ed 
duty,  or  of  charging  an  e n e my  in  line.  T he  R u s s i a n s,  t h e n,  w e re  quite  right 
in  reserving  every  sabre  and  b a y o n et  for  t he  battle  of  t he  Alma.

being  established  b e y o nd  doubt,  Menchikoff  b r o ke  off  t he  battle,  c o v e r ed 
his  r e t r e at  by  his  r e s e r v e s,  a nd  after  o v e r c o m i ng  the  first  disorder  created 
on  his  left  by  B o s q u e t 's  flank  m o v e m e nt  retired  u n p u r s u ed  a nd  u n m o l e s t e d, 
"in  p r o ud  o r d e r ,"  from  the  field.  T he  allies  say  t h ey  h ad  no  cavalry  for  the 
pursuit;  b ut  since  we  k n ow  t h at  t he  Russians  h ad  b ut  t wo  regiments  of 
Hussars—less,  if  anything,  t h an the  allies—this  e x c u se falls  to  the  ground.  As 
at  Zorndorf,  at  E y l a u,  at  B o r o d i n o,  the  R u s s i an  infantry,  t h o u gh  b e a t e n, 
b e h a v ed  up  to  the  character  given  t h em  by  G e n e r al  C a t h c a r t,  w ho  c o m 
m a n d ed  a  division  against  t h e m,  and  w ho  p r o n o u n c ed  t h em  "incapable  of 

10  p a n i c !" 

B ut  if  the  Russian  infantry  r e m a i n ed  cool  a nd  unterrified,  Menchikoff 
himself  w as  panic-struck.  T he  great  numerical  force  of  the  allies,  coupled 
w i th  their  u n e x p e c t ed  decision  and  impetuosity  in  the  attack,  deranged,  for 
a  m o m e n t,  his  plans.  He  a b a n d o n ed  t he  idea  of  retreating  into  the  interior 
of  the  Crimea,  and  m a r c h ed  to  the  south  of  S e v a s t o p o l,  in  o r d er  to hold the 
line  of  t he  C h e r n a y a.  This  w as  a  great  a nd  u n p a r d o n a b le  mistake.  Over 
looking,  from  the  hights  of  the  A l m a,  the  w h o le  allied position,  he  m u st h a ve 
b e en  able  to  m a ke  out  t he  strength  of  his  o p p o n e n ts  within  5,000  men.  He 
m u st  h a ve  k n o wn  that,  w h a t e v er  w as  their  relative  superiority  over  his  o wn 
forces,  t h ey  w e re  n ot  strong e n o u gh to  leave  an  a r my to  o b s e r ve  Sevastopol 
while  following  him  into  the  interior.  He  m u st  h a ve  k n o wn  that  if  the  allies 
w e re  t wo  to  o ne  against  him  on  t he  sea-shore,  he  could  bring  t wo  against 
their  o ne  at  Simferopol.  A nd  y et  he  m a r c h e d,  as  he  himself  confesses,  to 
t he  s o u th  side  of  Sevastopol.  B u t,  after this  retreat h ad b e en effected,  without 
any  molestation  from  t he  allies,  and  his  t r o o ps  h ad  r e s t ed  a  day  or  t wo  on 
t he  hills  behind  t he  C h e r n a y a,  t h en  Menchikoff  resolved  to  redress  his 
mistake.  He  did  this  by  a  perilous  flank  m o v e m e nt  from  t he  C h e r n a ya  to 
Bakshi-Serai.  It  w as  c o n t r a ry  to  o ne  of  t he  first  rules  of  strategy;  y et  it 
promised  great  results.  W h en  a  blunder  is  o n ce  c o m m i t t ed  in  strategy,  y ou

to  it. 

On  t he  2d  or  3d  of  O c t o b er  Sevastopol  w as  invested,  a nd  t he  allies  t o ok

F r om  that  m o m e nt  t he m e m o r a b le  siege  of  Sevastopol b e g a n,  and  at t he  same 
time  a  n ew  e ra  in  t he  campaign.  Hitherto  t he  allies,  by  their  u n c o n t e s t ed 
superiority,  had  it  all  their  o wn  way.  Their  fleets,  c o m m a n d i ng  t he  sea, 
insured their landing.  O n ce landed, their superior n u m b e r s, and certainly also 
their  superior  storming  qualities,  insured  the  victory  at  t he  A l m a.  B ut  n ow

develop  itself.  Menchikoff's  army,  it  is  t r u e,  did  not  show  itself  y e t;  but  it 
m a de  n e c e s s a ry  the  placing of a reserve on the C h e r n a y a, fronting to  the east. 
T h us  the  actual  besieging  a r my  was  seriosly  w e a k e n e d,  and  r e d u c ed  to 
n u m b e rs  n ot  m u ch  superior  to  those  of  the  garrison. 

W a nt  of  energy,  w a nt  of  system,  especially  in  t he  c o o p e r a t i on  of  the

to  2,500  y a r ds  from  the Russian w o r k s.  S u ch a thing w as  n e v er  s e en n or heard 
of in  any p r e v i o us  siege.  It p r o v es t h at t he Russians  w e re  still  able  to  dispute 
the  ground  a r o u nd  the  fortress,  to  the  distance  of  at  least  a  mile;  and  t h ey 
actually  held  it  up  to  t he  17th.  On  the  morning  of  t h at  day  t he  siege-works 
w e re  far  e n o u gh  a d v a n c ed  to  allow  the  allies  to  o p en  their  fire.  P r o b a b ly  this 
would  h a ve  b e en  delayed  a  few  days  longer,  as  t he  allies  w e re  by  no  means 
in  a  fit  position  to  do  so  with  success  on  that  day,  h ad  it  n ot  b e en  for  the

a  couple  of  h o u rs  t he  Russians  silenced  the  fire  of  t he  F r e n ch  batteries  and 
k e pt  up  an  almost  equal  contest,  throughout  the  d a y,  with  the  English.  To 
c r e a te  a  diversion,  a  naval  attack  w as  m a d e.  B ut  it  w as  neither  better  con-
d u c t ed  nor  m o re  successful.  T he F r e n ch ships, attacking t he Q u a r a n t i ne F o rt 
a nd  F o rt  Alexander,  supported  t he  land  a t t a ck  u p on  t h e se  forts;  and  h ad  it 
n ot  b e en  for  their  aid,  t h e re  is  no  d o u bt  the  F r e n ch w o u ld h a ve b e en far  m o re 
roughly  handled.  T he  English  ships  attacked  the  n o r th  side  of  the  harbor,

b a t t e ry  c o n s t r u c t ed  to  t he  north-east  of  C o n s t a n t i n e.  T h at  cautious  man, 
Admiral  D u n d a s,  h ad  ordered  his  ships  to  a n c h or  at  1,200  y a r ds  from  the 
forts—he  is  evidently  a  friend  of  t he  long-range  system.  N ow  it  is  an  old 
established  fact,  that  in  a  c o m b at  b e t w e en  ships  a nd  batteries  on  s h o r e,  the 
ships  are  b e at  unless  t h ey  can  close  up  within  200  y a r ds  or  less  to  t he  bat 
teries,  so  t h at  their  shot  is  certain  to  tell,  and  with  the  greater  effect.  Con 
sequently,  D u n d as  got  his  ships  k n o c k ed  a b o ut  in  a  terrible  m a n n er  and 
w o u ld  h a ve  suffered  a  glorious  defeat,  h ad  it n ot b e en for  Sir  E d m u nd L y o n s,

T he  F r e n ch  w e re  almost  silent for  a couple  of  d a ys  afterward.  T he  English, 
having  established  their  batteries  at a greater distance from t he  Russian lines, 
and  mounting heavier calibers t h an their allies, w e re enabled to maintain their 
fire  and  to  silence  t he  u p p er  tier  of  g u ns  in  a  m a s o n ry  r e d o u b t.  T he  naval

to  pick  off,  from  any  c o v e r ed  position  they  could  find,  t he  R u s s i an  g u n n e r s. 
As  at  B o m a r s u n d,  the  Minié  rifle  did  its  w o rk well.  In  a few  d a y s,  w h at with 
the  h e a vy  guns  and  the  Minié  rifles,  the  Russian  artillerymen  w e re  mostly 
p ut  hors  de  combat.  So  w e re  t he  sailors  from  t he  fleet,  t he  p o r t i on  of  t he 
garrison  b e st  instructed  in  the  u se  of  h e a vy  guns.  T he  u s u al  r e s o u r ce  of 
besieged  garrisons  h ad  t h en to  be  resorted t o:  t he  infantry  w e re  c o m m a n d ed 
to  serve  the  guns,  u n d er  the  superintendence  of  the  remaining  artillerymen. 
B ut  their  fire,  as  m ay  be  imagined,  was  almost  without  effect,  and  t h us  the 
besiegers  w e re  enabled  to  p u sh  their  trenches  n e a r er  and  n e a r er  the  place. 
T h ey  h a ve  o p e n e d,  it  is  stated,  their  third  parallel  at  300  y a r ds  from  t he 
o u t w o r k s.  We  do  n ot  k n ow  yet w h at batteries  t h ey  h a ve  e r e c t ed  in this  third 
parallel ; we c an only say t h at a third parallel, in regular sieges, is always m a de 
at  the  foot  of  the  glacis  of  the  w o r ks  attacked,  t h at  is,  a b o ut  50  or  60  y a r ds 
from t he  ditch.  If  this  distance  has  b e en  e x c e e d ed  before  Sevastopol, we c an 
b ut  see  in  this  fact  a  confirmation  of  a  r e p o rt  contained  in  several  British 
p a p e r s,  t h at  t he  irregularity  of  the  lines  of  defense,  i n s t e ad  of  giving  t he 
British  engineers  fresh  scope  for  their  inventive  capacities,  has  b ut  discon 
certed  t h e se  gentlemen  w ho  c an demolish,  u p on t he  most  a p p r o v ed  principle, 
a  r e g u l a r b a s t i o n ed  front,  but w ho  seem  to  be  badly  off  as  s o on  as  the e n e my 
deviates  from  t he  rule  prescribed  by  the  b e st  authorities  on  t he  subject. 

T he  s o u t h e rn  attack o n ce  decided u p o n, the parallel  a nd its batteries  should 
h a ve  b e en  directed  against  o n e,  or  at  most  t wo  well-defined  fronts  of  t he 
d e f e n s e s.  T wo  of  the  outer  forts  next  to  e a ch  other—or,  at  t he  v e ry  outside, 
three—should  h a ve  b e en  attacked  with  c o n c e n t r a t ed  f o r c e s;  a n d,  o n ce  de 
molished,  t h en  all  the  other  o u t w o r ks  would  h a ve  b e en useless.  In  this  w a y, 
t he  allies,  by  bringing  all  their  artillery  to  b e ar  u p on  o ne  point,  could  h a ve 
easily  established  at  o n ce  a  great  superiority  of fire,  and  shortened  the  siege 
considerably.  As  far  as  c an  be  judged  from  plans  and  m a p s,  t he  front,  from 
t he  Q u a r a n t i ne  F o rt to  the  upper  end  of  the  inner  h a r b o r,  or  t he  front  against 
w h i ch  the  F r e n ch n ow direct their efforts,  would h a ve b e en t he b e st to  attack, 
as  its  demolition w o u ld  lay  the  t o wn  itself completely o p e n. T he o ne h u n d r ed 
a nd  thirty  guns  of  t he  allies  would  h a ve  at  o n ce  insured  t h em  a  superiority 
of  fire  on  this  limited  front.  Instead  of  this,  the  desire  to  let  e a ch  a r my  act 
independently  of  t he  other,  p r o d u c ed  this  u n p r e c e d e n t ed  m o de  of  siege,  in 
w h i ch  the  whole  of  the  r a m p a r t s,  extending  over  a  length  of  t h r ee  miles,  is

M u ch  anxiety—much  m o re  than  a p p e a rs  on  the  surface  of  things—exists  in 
England  as  well  as  in  F r a n ce  in  regard  to  the  i n c r e a s ed  a nd  increasing  dif 
ficulties  of  the  w a r;  and  the  stubborn  refusal  of  S e v a s t o p ol  to  fall  before  the 
allies,  t h o se  rivals  in  courage  and  sacrifices,  is  m o st ominously  viewed.  T he 
e x t r a c ts  in  another  c o l u mn  of  this  journal,  from  The  London  Times,  exhibit 
an  altered  t e m p e r,  and  a  spirit  of  doubt  w h i ch m ay  be  m i s t a k en by  some  for 
approaching  despair.  In  the  absence  of  details  respecting  t he  battle  of  the

T he  25th of  O c t o b er  w as  the  d ay on w h i ch the  slow  m o n o t o ny  of  the  siege 
of  S e v a s t o p ol  was  first interrupted by  a dramatic  incident.  The^Russians,  on 
that  d a y,  attacked  the  allied  position  covering  the  siege,  and  the  advantages 
being  m o re  equally  distributed,  this  time,  to  either  side,  t he  result  w as  v e ry 
different  from  that  of  the  battle  of  the  Alma.  This  action,  in  fact,  w as  the 
v e ry  c o u n t e r p a rt  of  t h at  of  the  Alma:  it  w as  a  cavalry  fight  almost  ex 
clusively,  while  at the  A l ma no  cavalry w as  engaged;  a nd  instead  of o c c u p y-

vantages  of  strong  positions  w e re  with  the  allies.  It  w a s,  indeed,  a  d r a wn

British,  the  chief  harbor  for  their  fleet,  the  grand  d é p ôt  for  their  s t o r e s;  and

therefore,  n e c e s s a ry  to  include  Balaklava  in  t he  system  of  defense.  T he 
c o u n t ry  a b o ut  Balaklava  is  f o r m ed  by  a  g r o up  of  v e ry  irregular  hights, 
running  from  the  s o u t h e rn  extremity  of  the  aforesaid  range,  nearly  d ue  e a st 
a nd  w e st  along the coast,  and like all hills in t he Crimea,  sloping gently t o w a rd 
t he  north-west,  b ut  steep  and  craggy  t o w a rd  the  south-east.  T h us  an  angle 
f o r m ed  b e t w e en  t h e se  t wo  groups  of  hights,  is  filled  up  by  an  undulating 
plain,  rising gradually  t o w a rd  the  east,  until  it e n ds  in  a  steep  d e s c e nt  t o w a rd 
t he  valley  of  t he  C h e r n a y a. 

T he  m o st  r e m a r k a b le  feature  of  this  plain  is  a  range  of  hillocks  and  of 
slightly  elevated  ground  running  north-west  and  south-east,  uniting  w h at  we 
call  the  Heracleatic  range  with  t he  m o u n t a i ns  on  the  s o u th  coast.  It  w as  on 
this  elevation,  about  t h r ee  miles  east  and  north-east  of  Balaklava,  that  the 
allies  had  t h r o wn  up  their  first  line  of  defenses,  consisting of four  r e d o u b t s, 
defending  the  r o a ds  from  Bakshiserai  a nd  from  t he  U p p er  C h e r n a y a.  T h e se 
r e d o u b ts  w e re  garrisoned  by  T u r k s.  A  second line of field-works w as  e r e c t ed 
immediately  in  front  of  Balaklava,  a nd c o n t i n u ed up  to t he  a p ex of t he  angle 
f o r m ed  by  the  c o a st  hights  a nd  the  H e r a c l e a t ic  range  w h i ch  latter  w e re 
fortified  by  t he  F r e n ch  division  of  General  B o s q u e t,  stationed  t h e r e.  T h u s, 
while  t he  second  line,  defended  by  English  soldiers,  m a r i n es and  sailors, w as 
continued  and  flanked  by  t he  F r e n ch  line  of  r e d o u b t s,  the  first  or  T u r k i sh 
line,  nearly  t wo  miles  in  a d v a n c e,  n ot only  w as  completely u n s u p p o r t e d, b ut 
strange  to  say,  instead  of  forming  a  line  perpendicular  to  t he  r o ad  on  which 
the  e n e my  could  c o m e,  it w as  constructed  almost  in  the  prolongation of  that 
line,  so  that  the  Russians  might first t a ke  o n e,  t h en  the  second,  t h en  the  third 
and  finally  the  fourth  r e d o u b t,  gaining  ground  e a ch  time,  and  w i t h o ut  the 
possibility  of  one  r e d o u bt  m u ch  supporting  the  other. 

T he  allied  position  w as  occupied:  t o w a rd  Balaklava,  by  the  T u r ks  in  the 
r e d o u b t s,  or  first  line;  by  British  marines,  on  t he  hights,  in  the  immediate

At  6'clock  on  the  morning  of  the  25th,  G e n.  L i p r a n di  led  the  Russians  to

T he  m a in  column,  following  first  the  c o u r se  of  the  C h e r n a y a,  and  t h en  a

After  this  the  action  ceased.  T he  Russians  demolished  the  t wo  r e d o u b ts

T he  negligence  s h o wn  by  the  British  in  the  m a n n er  of  o c c u p y i ng  their 
positions  is utterly  disgraceful to their c o m m a n d e r. T h e re is no e x c u s e, either

knoll  on  t he  n o r th  e nd  of  the  range,  forcing  the  British  position  w i th  h e a vy 
field  artillery.  T he  British  p a p e rs  say  the  Russians  h ad  24  and  32-pounders 
in t he  field,  b ut this  only  s h o ws  their  utter  ignorance  of  artillery m a t t e r s.  T he

howitzer,  throwing  a  hollow  projectile  with  a  small  c h a r g e,  and  obtaining 
range  by  elevation  chiefly,  c an  be  made  of  a  larger  b o re  t h an t he  c a n n on  for

to 
12-pounders;  t h e se  howitzers  are  attached  in  the  R u s s i an  service  to  the

unite  in  manufacturing  h e r o es  and  enhancing t he  glory  of  a nation's  a r m s.

So  far,  everything  w e nt  in  favor  of  t he  R u s s i a n s.  Their  generalship  h ad 
p r o v ed  far  superior  to  that  of  L o rd  Raglan.  Their  plan  w as  excellent,  and

T he  R u s s i an  c o m m a n d er  begins  by  drawing  up  a  v e ry  good  plan  of  attack, 
b o r r o w ed  from  o ne  of  N a p o l e o n 's  most  celebrated  b a t t l e s,  (for  no  Russian 
General  e v er  had  an  original  thought,  not  e v en  Suvaroff,  w h o se  only  origi 
nality  w as  t h at  of  direct  advance).  He  follows  this  up  by  setting  a b o ut  its 
e x e c u t i on  in  t he  v e ry  b e st  m a n n er  possible.  He  establishes  himself  on  the 
e n e m y 's  flank.  T he  strategical  m o v e m e nt  is  c o m p l e t e d;  t he  tactical  per 
f o r m a n ce  begins.  A nd  h e r e,  all  at  o n c e,  the  scientific  a nd  learned  m o de  of 
warfare,  t he  w o rk  of  w e s t e rn  civilization,  is  t h r o wn  a w a y,  and  t he  p u re 
barbarism  b r e a ks  forth.  This  splendid  army,  with  its  old  t r o o p s,  m a ny  of 
w h om  h ad  b e en  twenty-five  years  u n d er  a r m s,  this  m o d el  of  parade-drill,  is 
so  clumsy,  so  incapable  of  skirmishing  and  fighting  in  small  b o d i e s,  t h at  its 
officers  c an  do  nothing  with  it b ut t h r ow its  h e a vy  bulk in  a  single  m a ss u p on

a d v a n c e,  is  t he  only  thing  that  c an  be  done.  This  d e n se  m a ss  of  living  flesh 
w a s,  of  c o u r s e,  by  its  v e ry c o m p a c t n e s s,  the  best  m a rk an artilleryman could

allied  lines.  B ut  h e re  t h ey  found  an  o p p o n e nt  a c c u s t o m ed  to  t h at  style  of

s h o ck  of  d e n se  m a s s e s,  e v en  if  of  superior  n u m b e r s.  A n d,  if  the  R u s s i a ns

R u s s i a ns  a d o p t ed  t he  tactics  of  t he  Sikhs.  T he  Russian  c o l u m n,  w h en  t h ey

a nd  another  volley  at  fifty  y a r ds  a nd a charge  with t he b a y o n et w as  sufficient 
to  b r e ak  t h e m.  Afterward,  as  t he  Russians  c a me  up  m o re  n u m e r o u s l y,  t he 
British,  like  N a p o l e o n 's  squares  among  the  M a m e l u k e s,  at  t he  P y r a m i d s, 
stood  a m o ng  t he  flood  of  Russians  surrounding  t h e m.  T he  steadiness  of 
forces  having  t h at  full  confidence  in  themselves  w h i ch  only  the  m en  of  a 
highly  civilized  nation  c an  p o s s e s s,  and  the  superiority  of  t he  a r m a m e nt  a nd

Since  t he  d e s p e r a te  and  sanguinary  day  of  I n k e r m a n,  t he  c a m p a i gn  in  the 
C r i m ea  h as  b e en  m a r k ed  by  no  military  event  of  any  i m p o r t a n c e;  b u t,  t he 
a d v e nt  of  winter  without  the  capture  of  Sevastopol  having  given  a  n ew 
c h a r a c t er to  t he  enterprise,  it b e c o m es  p r o p er to  review t he  c o u r se  of e v e n ts 
since  t he  landing  of  the  Expedition,  in  order  to  d e t e r m i ne  w h at  are  the

t h at  n ow  await  it.  First,  h o w e v e r,  we  m u st  add  a  few  w o r ds  to  o ur  f o r m er 
o b s e r v a t i o ns  u p on  t he  last  memorable  battle.  With  regard  to  this  e v e n t, 
extraordinary  confusion  and  w a nt  of  perspicacity  c h a r a c t e r i z es  t he  official 
r e p o r t s,  all  of  w h i ch  we  h a ve  published.  L o rd  R a g l a n 's  dispatch  w as  evi 
dently  written  in  a  great  h u r r y.  Confounding  that  front  of  his  a r my  t o w a rd 
t he  C h e r n a ya  with  t h at  t o w a rd  Sevastopol,  he  calls  t he  s a me  flank  of  his 
position  sometimes  the  right,  sometimes  the  left,  in  t he  s a me  dispatch,  so 
t h at it is  impossible  to  get a clear idea of t he e v e n ts from this  s o u r c e.  C a n r o b- 
e r t 's  dispatch  is  as  diffuse  and  indefinite  as  it  is  short,  and  therefore  quite 
u s e l e s s;  and  w h o e v er  c o m p a r es  t he  so-called  Menchikoff  dispatch  of  t he 
Russian  Invalid with  t he  f o r m er  r e p o r ts  of  Prince  Menchikoff,  m u st  s ee  at 
a  glance  t h at  this  w as  not  p e n n ed  by  t he  same  man.  N i c h o l a s,  evidently,  has 
found  t h at  he  has  allowed  quite  enough  of t he liberty of  the  p r e s s,  and  since 
telling  t he  t r u th  like  a  gentleman  does  not  p r e v e nt  his  t r o o ps  from  getting 
b e a t e n,  he  considers  it  quite  as  well  to  r e t u rn  to  the  old  system  of  lying.  By 
his  Imperial  will,  t he  ordinary  c o u r se  of  events  is  altered  after  t he  fact,  and 
a  defeated  attack  from  his  relieving  a r my  against  t he  besiegers  is  c h a n g ed 
to  a victorious  sally from within the t o w n. T he r e a s on is evident: T he sallying 
force  necessarily  retires  into  its  fortifications  so  s o on  as  the  object  of  the 
sally  is  obtained;  t he  r e t r e at  t h us  is  explained  a nd  m a de  a  m a t t er  of  c o u r s e; 
while,  if  the  facts  w e re  stated  as  they  actually  o c c u r r e d,  the  disgrace  of  the 
defeat  could  not  be  hidden.

A nd  well  might N i c h o l as  do his b e st to hide the c i r c u m s t a n c es of this battle 
from  his  p e o p l e.  N e v er  since  the  battle  of  N a r va  h as  s u ch  disgrace  b e en 
h e a p ed  upon  the  R u s s i an  a r m s.  A n d,  considering the  t r e m e n d o us  difference 
b e t w e en  the  Russians  of  N a r va  and  t he  R u s s i a ns  of  I n k e r m a n,  the  undrilled 
h o r d es  of  1700,  and  the  well-drilled  a r my  of  1854,  the  day  of  N a r va  m u s t, 
in  c o m p a r i s o n,  be  considered  a bright  one  in  Russian  military  history.  N a r va 
w as  the  first  grand  disaster  of  a rising  nation,  w h o se  determined  spirit learnt 
h ow  to  c o n q u er by  defeat itself.  I n k e r m an  almost  a p p e a rs  a certain  indication 
of  the  d e c ay  of  that  hot-house  d e v e l o p m e nt  w h i ch  Russia  has  e x p e r i e n c ed 
since  Peter  t he  Great.  T he  artificial  g r o w th  and  t he  mere  effort  to  k e ep  u p, 
with  a  b a r b a r i an  material,  a  splendid  show  of  civilization,  a p p e a rs  already 
to  h a ve  e x h a u s t ed  t he  nation,  and  inflicted  a  sort  of  p u l m o n a ry  c o n s u m p t i on 
u p on  it.  In  all  the  battles  of  the  p r e s e nt  c e n t u r y,  from  Austerlitz  and  E y l au 
d o wn  to  Silistria,  t he  Russians  had  s h o wn  t h e m s e l v es  excellent  soldiers. 
Their  defeats,  w h e r e v er  t h ey o c c u r r e d,  could  be  explained ;  t h ey left no stain 
u p on  t he  h o n or  of  the  a r m y,  if  t h ey  did  u p on  t he  r e p u t a t i on  of  its  generals. 
B ut  n ow  the  m a t t er  is  completely  changed.  If  B a l a k l a va  showed  t he  superi 
ority  of  t he  allied  cavalry,  if  t he  whole  of  t he  siege  of  Sevastopol  shows  t he 
e n o r m o us  superiority  of  the  allied  artillery  o v er  t he Russian,  still the Russian 
infantry  r e m a i n ed  in  p o s s e s s i on  of  its  high  r e p u t a t i o n.  Inkerman has settled 
this  point  too.  Strange  to  say,  t he  R u s s i an  infantry  h as  forfeited  its  r e n o wn 
in  a  battle,  in  which,  p e r h a p s,  the  individual R u s s i an foot-soldier fought m o re 
bravely  t h an ever.  T he  sovereign mediocrity w h i ch  has  b e en the  chief  c h a r a c 
teristic  of all military  operations in this war, b o th on the Russian and t he allied 
side,  has  n e v er  b e en  m a de  m o re  apparent.  E v e ry m o v e m e n t,  and e v e ry  step 
t a k e n,  has  p r o d u c ed  a  result  exactly  the  opposite  of  w h at  w as  intended.  A 
coup  de  main  is  u n d e r t a k e n, and  it t u r ns o ut to involve  a campaign—a w i n t er 
campaign  even.  A  battle  is  fought,  b ut its  gain is  only  m o m e n t a r y,  vanishing 
in  less  t h an  a  w e ek  from  the  hands  of  the  victors.  An  o p en  t o wn  is  assailed 
30  with  h e a vy  siege  artillery;  but,  b e f o re  t he  siege train is b r o u g ht u p,  t he  o p en 
t o wn is changed into af ortif ied c a mp of the first o r d e r. A siege is u n d e r t a k e n; 
and,  w h en  at  the  point  of  being  successful,  it  h as  to  be  given  u p,  b e c a u se 
a  relieving  a r my  c o m es  u p,  and  is—not  victorious,  b ut  defeated.  A  strong 
position  t a k en  up  against  t he  relieving  a r my  b e c o m e s,  by  the  very  shortness 
of  its  front,  the  m e a ns  in the  h a n ds  of  the  relieving  a r my to turn the besiegers 
into  t he  besieged!  T h us  t en  w e e ks  are  o c c u p i ed  with  a  series  of  efforts, 
c o m b a t s,  t r e n c h - w o r k s,  plans  and  c o u n t e r - p l a n s;  winter  sets  in,  and  finds 
b o th  armies—but  especially  the  allies—quite  u n p r e p a r ed  for  the  season:  a nd 
all  this  with  no  result b ut  a t r e m e n d o us  loss  on  b o th  sides,  leaving  a  decision 
of  the  campaign  as  r e m o te  a nd  unlikely  as  ever.

a nd  t oo  large  for  a  coup  de  main.  It  could  not  be  e m b a r k ed  with  rapidity; 
the  m o n t hs  e m p l o y ed  in  preparation  w e re  sufficient  to  p ut  the  Russians  on 
their  g u a r d;  and,  if t he  p r e s e n ce  of t he  Austrians g u a r a n t e ed  t he Principalities

from  any serious  danger ;  for,  the  position  of  t he  Austrians  being on t he flank 
and  rear  of  either  line  of  operations,  neither  a r my  could  h a ve  m a r c h ed 
f o r w a rd  without  being  at  their  mercy.  T h u s,  the  Russians  m u st  h a ve  b e en

which,  t he  p o r ts  of  C h e r s on  a nd  Nicolaieff,  the  d o c k - y a r ds  of  t he  R u s s i an

clear  from  the  w ay  it  w as  commenced—in  the  m o st  irregular  m a n n e r. 

W h e n,  at  the  Alma,  the  allies  had  to  allow  the  R u s s i a ns  to  w i t h d r aw  in 
perfect  order  from  the  field  of  battle,  although  a t t a c k ed  by  far  superior

Vacillation  followed;  d a ys  w e re  lost;  the  m a r ch  to  Balaklava  w as  at  last 
resolved  u p o n,  a nd  t he  advantages  of  a  strong  defensive  position  overruled

w h i ch  c o m m a n d ed  the  t o w n,  and  w a s,  therefore,  t he  decisive  point.  At  t he

fire  w h i ch  t he  allies  have  kept  up  since  the  5th  of  N o v.  c an  do  any  h a rm  to 
t he  defenses  of  t he  place,  or  e v en  prevent  t he  R u s s i a ns  from  repairing  t he 
d a m a ge  d o ne  up  to  that  time.  T h e re  is  no  d o u bt  that  t he  siege,  if  t a k en  up 
again,  will h a ve to be d o ne over afresh, with t he only difference that, p e r h a p s,

the  Russians  on  the  south-west,  is  now  the  Austrian  a r m y, which,  in  a force 
of  some  270,000,  occupies  Galicia,  Transylvania  and  Moldavia.  This  force 
m u s t,  a b o ve  all  things,  be  held  in  check.  For,  should  it  declare  itself  hostile 
to  Russia,  Bessarabia,  and  e v en  the  c o u n t ry  up  to  the  Bug  w o u ld  h a ve  to 
be  a b a n d o n e d,  and  operations  have  to be  c o n d u c t ed either from  the  offensive

Dnieper.  In  b o th  cases  a  D a n u b i an  a r my  would  be  cut  off,  and  h a ve  to  find 
a  b a se  of  its  o wn  s o m e w h e re  in  the  steppes  of  the  S o u t h,  which  is  no  easy 
matter,  in  a  c o u n t ry  which  feeds  m a ny  horses  and  s h e e p,  b ut  v e ry  few  m e n. 
On  the  other  h a n d,  should  Austria  declare  for  Russia,  or  t u rn  t he  points  of 
her  neutral  b a y o n e ts  t o w a r ds  the  Alps  and  the  R h i n e,  t h en  t he  Polish  a r my

a  strong  corps  t o w a rd  the  Danube,—or  the  Austrians  p o ur  in  a  m a ss  upon 
t he  D a n u be  and  risk  a  march  to  Constantinople.  In  either  c a s e,  a  separate 
a r my  on  the  D a n u b e,  stronger  than  a  d e m o n s t r a t i on  c o r p s,  w as  super 
fluous. 

As  to  the  cooperation  of  Austria in  this  war,  we  can,  of  c o u r s e,  only  s p e ak 
in  an  altogether  hypothetical  way.  T he  noisily  t r u m p e t ed  T r e a ty  of  Alliance

P o w e rs  into  an  alliance  offensive  and  defensive  with  Austria,  if she  should 
c h o o se  to  declare  w ar  on  Russia,  and  obliges  t h em  besides  to  p r o p o se  to 
Russia,  before  t he  end  of  the  year,  conditions  of  p e a ce  on  the  basis  of  the 
f a m o us  four  points.  After  all, Austria might then,  " w i t h o ut a b r e a ch of faith," 
release  herself  from  t he  alliance  by  saying,  " at  the  last  m o m e n t ,"  she  did 
n ot  c o n c ur in the  interpretation put on the four  points  by  the  W e s t e rn  P o w e r s. 
T he  result  of  L o rd  J o hn  Russell's  explanation  of  the  glorious  t r e a ty  of 
D e c e m b er  2,  w as  an  immediate  fall  of  the  funds,  b o th  at  L o n d on  and  at 
Paris. 

A  y e ar  ago,  the coalition p r e t e n d ed to h a ve allowed the m a s s a c re of Sinope 
to  t a ke  place  in  order  to  obtain  t he  alliance  of  t he  G e r m an  p o w e r s.  N o w,  a 
sham  treaty  with  o ne  of  these  p o w e rs  is  held  o ut  as  the  equivalent  for  the 
loss  n ot  of  a  T u r k i sh  fleet,  b ut  of  a  British  army.  We  are  even  assured  by 
the  latest  G e r m an  p a p e r s, t h at the  opening of  the  British  Parliament has  given 
t he  signal  for  the  r e a p p e a r a n ce  of  t he  specter  of  t he  Vienna  Conference, 
w h i ch  w as  a b o ut  o n ce  more  to  set  its  c u m b r o us  machinery  at  w o r k. 

H o w e v e r,  as  Austria,  according  to  L o rd  J o hn  Russell,  declares  it possible 
that  she  m ay  be  driven  to  w ar  with  Russia,  a nd  as  the  position  t a k en  by  the 
R u s s i an  a r my  on  the  Austrian  frontier  indicates  the  same  thing,  we  m ay 
suppose,  for  a  m o m e n t,  that Austria and t he rest  of  G e r m a n y, even including 
Prussia,  are  to  join  the  W e s t e rn  P o w e r s.  H ow  far  would  Russia be  p r e p a r ed 
to  meet  such  an  eventuality? 

If  in  1812  the  Continental  force  launched  against  Russia,  w as  far  w e a k er 
t h an t h at  which  she  m ay  p e r h a ps  see  on  her  frontiers  in  April  or  M a y;  if t h en 
England  w as  her  ally  instead  of  her foe,  Russia m ay  console  herself with the 
reflection  that  the  more  n u m e r o us  the  armies  are  which  p e n e t r a te  into  h er 
interior,  the  m o re  c h a n ce  is  there  of  their  s p e e dy  destruction,  and  that,  on 
t he  other  hand,  she  has  n ow  t h r ee  times  t he  t r o o ps  u n d er  arms  which  she 
had  then. 

35

N ot  t h at  we  think  " H o ly  R u s s i a"  unassailable.  On  the  c o n t r a r y,  Austria 
alone  we  consider  fully  her  equal  as  to  military  r e s o u r c e s,  while  Austria  a nd 
Prussia  united,  are  quite  able,  if  merely  military  c h a n c es  are  t a k en  into 
account,  to  force  her  to  an  ignominious  p e a c e.  A ny  forty  millions  of  m e n, 
c o n c e n t r a t ed  u p on  a  c o u n t ry  of  the  size  of  G e r m a ny  proper,  will  be  able  to

to  a b a n d on  this  plan,  late  in  the  season,  from  political  r e a s o n s,  from  t he

if  N a p o l e on  had  not,  by  his  hurried  a d v a n ce  from  Smolensk,  tied  himself

forage  out  t he  c o u n t ry  at  a  short  distance  from  his  line  of  m a r c h,  and  his 
foraging  parties,  at that  time,  appear  actually to  h a ve b e en afraid of penetrat

of  o p e r a t i on  provided  with  every  necessary. 

B ut  n ot  only  military  questions  are  to  be  decided.  S u ch  a  w ar  m u st  be 
brought  to  a  close  by  political  action  t o o.  It  is  possible  that  t he  declaration 
of  G e r m a ny  against  Russia  would  be  the  signal for  the restoration of Poland 
by  R u s s ia  herself.  Nicholas  would  certainly  not  p a rt  with  t he  Lithuanian  and 
other  W e s t - R u s s i an  p r o v i n c e s;  b ut  the  kingdom  of  Poland,  Galicia,  P o s e n, 
a nd  p e r h a ps  W e st  and  E a st Prussia,  w o u ld form  a p r e t ty  good-sized kingdom. 
W h e t h er  s u ch  a  revival  of  Poland  would  be  d u r a b l e,  w ho  c an tell?  O ne  thing 
is  certain:  it would  put  an  end  to  what  is  hollow in the e n t h u s i a sm for Poland, 
which,  for  the  last  forty  y e a r s,  has  b e en  affected  by  e v e r y b o dy  and  a n y b o dy 
calling  himself  liberal  or  progressive.  A  R u s s i an  appeal  to  H u n g a ry  would 
be  sure  to  follow;  and,  if  the  M a g y a rs  should  d e m u r,  we  m u st  n ot forget t h at 
two-thirds  of  the  population  of  H u n g a ry  consists  of  Slaves,  who  consider 
the  M a g y a rs  as  a ruling  and  intruding  aristocracy.  On t he other h a n d, A u s t r ia 
would,  in  s u ch  a  c a s e,  not  hesitate  to  r e s t o re  t he  ancient  H u n g a r i an  Con 
stitution,  t h us  aiming  to  blot  H u n g a ry  o ut  of  the  m ap  of  revolutionary 
E u r o p e. 

This  suffices  to  show  w h at  a  wide  p e r s p e c t i ve  of  military  and  political 
interest w o u ld be  o p e n ed by  the  accession  of  Austria to t he w e s t e rn alliance, 
and  a  c h a n ce  of  a w ar  of  all  E u r o pe  against Russia.  On  t he  c o n t r a ry  supposi 
tion,  t he  spring  is  likely  to  see  a million  a nd  a half  of  soldiers  a r r a y ed  against 
the  W e s t e rn  P o w e r s,  a nd  an  A u s t r o - P r u s s i an  a r my  marching  on  t he  F r e n ch

It  is  a  curious  fact,  that  the  English  p r e s s,  which,  for  the  last  six  m o n t h s, 
has  b u s i ed  itself  with  nothing  b ut  the  position  of  Austria,  should  n e v er  h a ve

can t h r ow  into  the  scale t he  m o m e nt  she  may  c h o o se to  follow  a definite  line 
of  policy.  T he  L o n d on  daily  journals  h a ve  b e en  divided  u p on  the  question 
w h e t h er  t he  Austrian  alliance  or  an o p en rupture  with  Austria w as  the  prefer 
able  thing.  B ut t h e se  journals,  which  r e p r e s e nt the  public  opinion  of  a nation 
priding  itself  u p on  being  the  most  businesslike  in  the  world,  h a ve  never 
c o n d e s c e n d ed  to  enter  into  those  details  and  statistics  w h i c h,  n ot  only  in  10 
t r a de  a nd  political  e c o n o m y,  b ut  also  in  national  policy,  form  the  ground 
w o rk  of  e v e ry  m e a s u re  intelligently  adopted.  In  truth,  the  British p r e ss  would 
s e em  to  be  c o n d u c t ed  by  gentlemen  w ho  are  as  ignorant  in  their  line  of 
business  as  those  British officers w ho  think t h ey are  doing  all their  d u ty w h en

useless,  b e c a u se  all  her  energies  are  required  to  k e ep  in  c h e ck  H u n g a r y,

T he  Austrian  a r m y,  though  managed  up  to  1849  according  to  a  c u m b r o us 
and  old-fashioned  s y s t e m,  was  entirely  remodeled  in  t h at  year.  T he  defeats 
in  H u n g a ry  had  as  great  a  p a rt  in  it  as  the  victories  in  Italy.  T he  Ad

and  40  regiments  of  cavalry,  which  h ad  b e en  split  up  during b o th  t he  Italian

army—5th,  6th,  7th  and  8th  a r m y - c o r p s,  and  2d  cavalry-corps,  and  the  third

sisting  only  of  the  4th  a r m y - c o r p s,  occupies  Italy.

E v e ry  army-corps  consists  of  from  two  to  t h r ee  divisions  of  infantry,  o ne

sary  d e t a c h m e n ts  of  pontonniers,  train-commissariat,  and  medical  officers. 
A  cavalry-corps  consists  of  t wo  divisions,  equal  to  four  brigades,  or  eight 
regiments  of  cavalry,  w i th  a  corresponding  n u m b er  of  light  batteries.  An

b a t t e ry  e a c h,  and  from  two  to  four  s q u a d r o ns  of  cavalry. 

T he  w h o le  force  thus  distributed  consists,  as  we  h a ve  stated  a b o v e,  of

twenty-five  battalions  of  riflemen.  A  regiment  of  the  line  consists  of  five

T he  Austrian  cavalry  consists  of  16  h e a vy  regiments,  (8  cuirassiers  and 
8  dragoons,)  and  24  light  regiments,  (12  hussars  and  12  lancers.)  In  the  arm

cuirassiers  and  dragoons  are  almost  exclusively  G e r m a ns  a nd  B o h e m i a n s; 
the  hussars  are  all  H u n g a r i a n s,  and  the  lancers  are  all  Poles.  In  the  infantry 
a  similar  distinction  could  hardly  be  kept  up  with  any  profit.  As  a  general 
rule,  the  G e r m a ns  and  Hungarians  form  the  élite  battalions  of  grenadiers, 
while  the  Tyrolese  ( G e r m an  and  Italian)  and  t he  Styrians  generally  furnish 
the  riflemen;  and  the  great  majority  of  the  frontier  infantry  is  c o m p o s ed  of 
C r o a ts  a nd  Servians,  w ho  are  equally  well  a d a p t ed  to  the  duties  of  light 
infantry. 

T he  h e a vy  cavalry  c o u n ts  six  active  s q u a d r o ns  and  o ne  d é p ô t - s q u a d r on

eight  active  and  one  d é p ô t - s q u a d r on  to  e a ch regiment, w i th 227  m en  to  e a ch

67,000  m e n,  including  d é p ô t s. 

T he  artillery  consists  of  twelve  field  regiments,  o ne  c o a st  regiment,  and 
o ne  r o c k et regiment.  T he  Austrians  h a ve  no  horse-artillery.  In  w h at t h ey call

E v e ry  field  regiment  h as  four  cavalry-batteries,  (six-pounders,)  a nd  seven 
foot-batteries,  (four  six-pounders  and  three  twelve-pounders,)  beside  r e

p e r m a n e nt  batteries,  b ut  is  only  divided  into  battalions  and  c o m p a n i e s,  and 
e m p l o y ed  for  garrisoning  t he  coast  defenses.  T he  rocket-regiment  has 
18  batteries,  of  eight  t u b es  each.  T he  total  of  Austrian  artillery  is  t h us  seen 
to  be  1,056  guns  and  114  rocket-tubes.  T he  artillery  h a s,  b e s i d e s,  eight

The  most  interesting  feature  of  the  news  brought  by  the  Asia  yesterday  is  the 
announcement  made  in  the  City  article  of  The  London  Times  of  April  8,  that  the 
Turkish  loan  had  failed  after  all,  and  that  Namik  Pasha  had  gone  home  without 
any  money.  This  is  stated  by  the  City  writer  of  The  Times  with  positiveness 
and  circumstantiality,  but  we  cannot  give  it  perfect  credence.  In  the  first  place 
our  own  correspondent  at  London,  who  is  almost  certain  to  be  exactly  informed 
on  whatever  related  to  the  transactions  of  Turkey,  there  and  at  Paris,  states 
the  contrary  with  equal  minuteness.  In  the  second  place,  Namik  Pasha  had 
10  brought  his  negotiations  to  a  conclusion,  whatever  it  was,  and  started  for  home 
on  Monday,  and  it  is  not  till  Friday,  after  he  had  been  gone  four  days,  that  the 
writer  in  The  Times  learns  that  he  has  failed,  and  that  the  loan  is  withdrawn 
from  the  market.  Certainly,  if  he  had  gone  home  in  disappointment,  this  fact 
would  hardly  have  remained  unknown,  and  the  loan  would  hardly  have  been 
15  kept  for  sale  four  days  longer.  Such  are  the  circumstances  which  militate  against 
this  important  statement;  still  there  is  an evident possibility of its truth, as well as of 
the  inference  of  The  Times,  that  the  French  Government  has  not  advanced  to 
Turkey  the  sum  of  $2,000,000  as  stated  in  the  journals  of  Paris.  Should  all  this 
prove  true,  and  should  what  is  suggested  by.  the  same  writer  also  prove  true, 
20  namely,  that  the  allies  will  not  come  forward  to  guarantee  the  proposed  loan,  it 
would  go  far  to  confirm  the  suspicion  that  they  do  not  mean  honestly  by  the 
Sultan.  The  only  alternative  to  this  inference  is  to  be  found  in  the  fact  that 
the  Ottoman  Government  have  taken  possession  of  the  mosques  of  the  Empire 
and  of  their  funds,  which  are  believed  to  be  considerable,  undertaking  on  the 
other  hand  hereafter  to  support  the  priesthood  and  the  other  expenses  of  worship 
from  the  imperial  treasury,  just  as  is  done  in  France  and  other  countries  of 
Western  Europe.  This  measure,  whose  execution,  as  we  learn  from  Constan 
tinople,  is  being  energetically  pushed  forward,  may  possibly  put  the  Porte  at 
ease,  financially,  for  the  time  being;  otherwise  it  has  no  resource  but  in  a  loan, 
and  if  defeated  in  obtaining  it,  must  be  terribly  embarrassed  in  prosecuting  the 
war,  at  the  same  time  that  it  is  exposed  to  the  danger  of  serious  outbreaks  on 
the  part  of  the  most  zealous  and  trustworthy  portion  of  its  Mussulman  sub 
jects.

The War 

Our  correspondent  at  Vienna  announces  the  conclusion  of  an  alliance  between 
the  German  powers,  by  which  the  entire  Confederation,  including  Austria  and 
Prussia  of  course,  undertakes  to  maintain  neutrality  through  the  war.  Whether 
they  can  succeed  in  keeping  out  of  the  quarrel  for  so  long  a  time  is  a  question 
on  which  a  positive  opinion  cannot  be  formed  at  present.  The  new  complications 
which  may  arise,  and  the  new  interests  which  may  be  developed  in  the  course 
of  the  struggle,  may  very  easily  render  nugatory  the  most  exact  calculations  that 
can  how  be  made.  Certain  it  is  that  but  for  dread  of  revolution,  against  which 
Russia  is  supposed  to  offer  a  protection,  the  German  powers,  and  especially 
the  German  people,  must  all  desire  the  humiliation  of  the  Czar,  whose  pre- 
pondérant  influence  they  hate,  and  whose  aggrandizement  they  spontaneously 
incline  to  resist.  But  on  the  other  side,  such  is  their  pecuniary  weakness,  and 
so  entire  is  their  doubt  of  the  loyalty  of  their  subjects,  that  they  must  regard 
the  risk  of  permanent  Russian  supremacy  as  far  less  formidable  than  that  of 
engaging  in  a  universal  war  with  the  revolution  lying  in  ambush  behind  the 
eventualities  of  the  contest.  So  they  will  remain  neutral  as  long  as  they  can, 
and  will  hold  themselves  ready,  when  they  finally  decide  to  go  into  the  fight, 
to  embrace  whichever  side  offers  them  the  greater  advantages.  We  do  not 
believe  they  will  be  led  either  way  by  any  other  motives  than  regard  for  their 
own  interest.  All  the  gratitude  Austria  owes  Russia  will  indeed  only  prove  a 
reason  for  her  to  attack  the  Czar  should  other  causes  seem  to  render  it  the 
more  profitable  course,  and  the  same  is  true  of  all  Germany  as  well. 

From  the  seat  of  War  on  the  Danube  there  is  no  intelligence  of  great  impor 
tance,  we  must,  however,  soon  hear  of  fighting  in  that  quarter.  The  allied 
fleets  are  in  the  Black  Sea,  and  Sir  Charles  Napier  is  advancing  in  the  Baltic. 
The  Russians  are  said  to  have  abandoned  the  Island  of  Aland,  and  he  can  occupy 
it  without  difficulty.  We  shall  not  have  to  wait  long  for  him  to  begin;  his 
fashion 
to  strike  rapidly  and  powerfully,  and  he  will  not  now  change. 
The  steamers  now  about  to  arrive  can  scarcely  fail  to  bring  bloody  intelli 
gence.

In  England  the  opinion  is  being  adopted  that  the  war  must  be  a  long  and  hard 
one.  They  are  looking  carefully  into  their  state  of  preparation  to  carry  it  on. 
In  the  House  of  Lords  on  the  7th  inst.  Earl  Grey  made  a  speech  showing  that  the 
administration  of  the  British  army  is  now  and  long  has  been in  the  highest  degree 
faulty,  extravagant,  and  opposed  to  efficiency,  rapidity  and  unity  in  the  service. 
The  care  and  provision  of  the  troops  he  proved  to  be  of  so  very  defective 
a  description  as  to  leave  room  to  expect  injurious  consequences  in  the  army 
now  sent  to  Turkey;  and  he  held  up  a  radical  reform  in  the  administration  of 
the  whole  military  establishment  as  absolutely  essential  to  success  in  the  present 
war.  His  speech  justly  made  a  deep  impression  on  the  House,  and  we  doubt  not  40 
will  carry  with  it  the  opinion  of  the  public.  The  London  Times  gives  it  a  power 
ful  indorsement.

With the rising power  of the middle class element in England, it is natural to  suppose 
that its  old position toward the aristocracy  should gradually become modified to  suit 
the  altered  circumstances,  and that the established relations between the two  classes 
should  begin  to  be  practically  inconvenient.  Within  the  last  five  years  some  note 
worthy  occurrences  have  taken  place  in  harmony  with  this  supposition.  About five 
years  ago  Jones  Lloyd,  the wealthy Banker, was  made  a Peer with the title of Lord 
Overstone;  he  had  invested  some of his  enormous  wealth in purchasing an estate  in 
the  County  of  Northampton,  and the aristocracy, true to their old policy, determined 
to  allow  him within their ranks, not because he was a millionaire, but because he was 
a "lord of acres broad." Now, what was the condition they demanded of Jones Lloyd? 
That  he  should  quit  all  connection  with  banking  and  commerce.  And  Jones  Lloyd 
submitted  to  the  condition.  Therefore  it  is  evident  the  aristocracy  have  relaxed 
nothing of  their  traditional ideas concerning what is a meet qualification for a peerage. 
15  But  will  everybody  of  the  haute  bourgeoisie  be  as  pliant as Jones  Lloyd?  Probably 
not. Nay more, we have an instance on record of the highest authority where a peerage 
was  rejected  during  life  and  forbidden  to  the  sons  after  death.  We  allude  to  the 
memorable case of the late  Sir Robert Peel.  He, the  son and grandson of a Lancashire 
mill-owner  and  manufacturer,  aspired  in  the  latter years  of his  life  to  lead  the  great 
20  middle  class,  and though the  peerage was for years within his  grasp, he  preferred to 
remain  the  first  Commoner  of  England,  and  shrank from  shelving  himself  from  the 
sphere  of  public  action  in  the  House  of  Lords.  We  have the  emphatic testimony of 
his  life  to  the  fact that  somewhere  within the  middle  class  rests the attractive center 
of  political  power;  and  that  clause  in  his  will  whereby  he  forbade  his  children ever 
to accept a peerage for any public services of his, when read by the light of the events 
of  1848,  still  fresh  in  the  public  mind—what  a revolutionary  example  and  precedent 
it  was!  Dying,  he  thus  revenged  himself  terribly  upon the  aristocracy  of  mere birth 
for  the  many  stings  his  sensitive  soul  had  been  made  to  suffer  on  account  of  his 
plebeian origin,  since  as  a boy  he  first  went to  Harrow.  Lord John Russell has  so far 
30 followed the precedent of Sir Robert Peel ; the peerage has long been within his reach, 
but though a son and brother of  a Duke  of  Bedford,  he  also  refuses to  shelve  himself. 
Quite lately  this  determination of  his  must  have  been put  to  a strong test. The office 

25 

579 

The  English  Middle Class  (First Article) 

of  President  of  the  Council is  almost always held by  a Peer,  and when in the recent 
Ministerial  changes  he  accepted  that  office  it  was  generally believed  that  he  would 
be  raised to the peerage.  But No!  he  preferred to remain a Commoner, to vacate his 
seat,  address  the  Electors  of  the  City  of  London,  and  be  returned  by  acclamation. 
Sir  William  Molesworth likewise regards the rumor that he was about to be elevated 
to  the  House  of  Lords  as  an  aspersion  on  his  political  character,  and  takes  care  to 
publish  a  positive  denial  that  he  was  likely  to  accept a  peerage. 

So  much for the peerage;  but it would  seem  that the  Knighthood as it carries with 
it  no  political  power,  has  been  flung  away  to  satisfy  the  parvenue  bourgeoisie.  On 
this  ground we  can explain the  elevation to  that rank of Sir Joseph Paxton, the Duke 
of  Devonshire's  head  gardener,  and  Sir John  Fox,  a  contractor.  But will this  satisfy 
the  middle  class  sense  of  self-importance  in  all  cases?  Apparently  not; for Stephen 
son,  the  engineer,  contemptuously  declined  the  trumpery  dignity,  and  still  more 
recently Dargan, the railway contractor, has followed his example, thinking, no doubt, 
that  to  accept  it  would  be  putting  himself  in  a  false  position.  In vain Royalty  woos 
him,  visits  him  in  his  handsome  mansion,  an  honor  previously  vouchsafed  only  to 
the  highest  aristocracy;  the  coy burgher  shrinks  from the extended hand of majesty, 
while Queen Victoria, grasping the  arm of the reluctant citizen, affords an expression 
of  the  need  that  feudalism  has  of  being  propped  up  in  these  days  by  the  industrial 
leaders  of  the  epoch. 

But  while  the  middle  class  are  thus  slowly  winning  power  from  the  aristocracy, 
it  is  natural  to  ask,  how  are  the  middle  classes  likely  to  use  their  newly  acquired 
influence?  This  matter  must be  looked  at from  no  class point of view, but from broad 
humanitarian  grounds;  and  the question that overleaps  all others is this  one—how is 
the  fate  and  social  condition of England's toiling millions likely to be affected by the 
change?

Some  politicians  of  the  so-called  liberal  school  have  talked  largely of  the  "union 
of the  middle  and  working classes,"  but the idea is absurdly chimerical.  Broad is the 
gulf  that  separates  the  employer  from  the  employed—the  master  from  the  servant. 
As  regards  domestic  service,  let  the  last  judicial  words  of  Talfourd  speak:  "How 
painful,"  said  he,  "is  the  thought that there  are  men  and women growing up  around 
us  ministering to  our  comforts  and  necessities, continually inmates of our dwellings, 
with  whose  affections  and  nature  we  are  as  much  unacquainted  as  if  they  were 
inhabitants  of some  other  sphere."  And  in  order  that  there  may  be  no  confusion  as 
to  the respective  inhabitants of the  "two  spheres," the middle class ladies, oblivious  35 
of  their  own  comparatively  recent  emancipation  from  serfdom,  compel  their female 
servants  to wear  "caps" as badges of the lower sphere, and  seldom allow their maids 
to  apparel  themselves  sprucely  for  fear  of  an  obliteration,  not  of  land,  but of  money 
marks. 

30 

And  as  regards  the  journeyman of  all descriptions,  in what relation does  he  stand  40 

to  his  employer? All know with what opposition the employers  met the "Ten Hours" 
bill.  The Tories, out of spite for the recent loss of the Corn Laws, helped the working 
class to get it; but when passed, the  reports of the district supervisors show with what 
shameless  cunning and petty underhand treacheries it was evaded. Every subsequent 
attempt in Parliament to  subject Labor to  more  humane  conditions  has  been met by  45 

580 

The  English  Middle  Class (First Article) 

the  middle  class  representatives  with the  catch-cry of Communism ! Mr. Cobden has 
acted  thus a score  of times.  Within the workshops for years the aim of the employers 
has  been  to  prolong  the  hours  of  labor  beyond  human  endurance,  and  by  an  un 
principled use of the contract  system, by pitting one man against another, to cut down 
the  earning  of  the  skilled  to  that  of  the  unskilled  laborer.  It was  this  system  that at 
last  drove  the  Amalgamated  Engineers to revolt,  and the brutality of the expressions 
that  passed  current  among  the  masters  at  that  time  showed  how  little  of  refined  or 
humane  feeling  was to be  looked for from them.  Their boorish ignorance  was  further 
displayed  in  the  employment  by  the  Masters'  Association  of  a  certain  third-rate 
littérateur,  Sidney  Smith, to undertake their  defense in the public  press  and to carry 
on  the  war  of  words  with  their  revolted  hands.  The  style  of  their  hired  writer  well 
fitted the  task he  had to  perform,  and when the  battle  was  over, the  Masters,  having 
no  more  need  of  literature  or  the  press,  gave  their  hireling  his  congé.  Although the 
middle class  do  not aim at the learning,  of the old school, they do not for that cultivate 
either modern science or literature. The ledger, the desk, business, that is education 
sufficient.  Their  daughters,  when  expensively  educated,  are  superficially  endowed 
with  a  few  "accomplishments;"  but  the  real  education  of  the  mind  and  the  storing 
it  with  knowledge  is  not  even  dreamed  of.

The present splendid brotherhood  of fiction-writers  in England, whose graphic and 
eloquent  pages  have  issued  to  the  world  more  political  and  social  truths  than  have 
been uttered  by  all  the professional politicians, publicists  and moralists put together, 
have  described  every  section of the  middle class from the  "highly genteel"  annuitant 
and  Fundholder  who  looks  upon  all  sorts  of  business  as  vulgar,  to  the  little  shop 
keeper  and lawyer's  clerk.  And how have  Dickens  and Thackeray,  Miss  Brontë  and 
25  Mrs. Gaskell  painted  them?  As  full  of  presumption,  affectation,  petty  tyranny  and 
ignorance;  and  the  civilized  world  have  confirmed  their  verdict  with  the  damning 
epigram  that  it  has  fixed  to  this  class  "that  they  are  servile  to  those  above,  and 
tyrannical  to  those  beneath  them." 

30 

The  cramped  and  narrow  sphere  in which they move  is  to  a certain degree  due  to 
the  social  system  of  which  they  form  a  part.  As  the  Russian  nobility  live  uneasily 
betwixt the  oppression  of the Czar above them  and the dread of the enslaved masses 
below them,  so the English middle class are hemmed in by the  aristocracy on the one 
hand  and  the  working  classes  on  the  other.  Since  the  peace  of  1815,  whenever  the 
middle  class  have  wished  to  take  action  against  the  aristocracy,  they  have  told the 
35  working classes  that their grievances  were attributable to  some aristocratic privilege 
and  monopoly.  By  this  means  the  middle  class  roused  the  working  classes  to  help 
them  in  1832  when  they  wanted  the  Reform  bill,  and  having  got  a  Reform  bill  for 
themselves, have  ever  since refused  one to the working classes—nay, in  1848, actually 
stood  arrayed  against  them  armed  with  special-constable  staves.  Next,  it  was  the 
repeal  of  the  Corn  Laws  that  would  be  the  panacea  for  the  working  classes.  Well, 
this  was  won from  the  aristocracy,  but  the  "good  time"  was  not yet come,  and  last 
year,  as  if  to  take  away  the  last  possibility  of  a  similar  policy  for  the  future,  the 
aristocracy were  compelled  to  accede  to  a tax on the  succession to real estate—a tax 
which  the  same  aristocracy  had  selfishly  exempted  themselves  from in  1793,  while 
they  imposed  it  on  the  succession  to  personal  estate.  With  this  rag  of  a  grievance 

45 

40 

581 

The  English  Middle Class (First Article) 

vanished the  last  chance  of  gulling the  working  classes  into  the belief that their hard 
lot was  due  solely to aristocratic legislation. The eyes of the working classes are now 
fully  opened:  they  begin to  cry:  "Our  St.  Petersburg is  at Preston!"  Indeed,  the last 
eight  months  have  seen  a  strange  spectacle  in  that  town—a  standing  army  of 
14,000  men  and  women  subsidized  by  the  trades  unions  and workshops  of  all  parts 
of the United Kingdom, to fight out a grand  social battle for mastery with the capital 
ists,  and the  capitalists  of Preston,  on their  side,  held up by the capitalists of Lanca 
shire. 

5 

Whatever  other  shapes  this  social  struggle  may  hereafter  assume,  we  have  seen 
only  the  beginning  of  it.  It  seems  destined  to  nationalize  itself  and  present  phases  10 
never  before  seen  in  history,  for  it  must  be  borne  in  mind  that  though  temporary 
defeat  may  await the  working classes, great social and economical laws are in opera 
tion which must eventually insure their triumph. The  same  industrial wave which has 
borne  the  middle  class  up  against  the  aristocracy,  is  now,  assisted  as  it  is  and  will 
be  by  emigration,  bearing the  working classes up  against the  middle  classes.  Just as  15 
the  middle  class  inflict  blows  upon  the  aristocracy,  so  will  they  receive  them from 
the  working  classes.  It  is  the  instinctive  perception  of  this  fact  that  already  fetters 
the  action  of that class  against the  aristocracy.  The recent political agitations  of the 
working  classes  have  taught  the  middle  class  to  hate  and fear overt political move 
ments.  In their cant, "respectable men don't join them, Sir." The higher middle classes 
ape  the  aristocracy  in their  modes  of  life,  and  endeavor  to  connect themselves  with 
it.  The  consequence  is  that  the  feudalism  of  England  will  not  perish  beneath  the 
scarcely  perceptible  dissolving  processes  of  the  middle  class;  the  honor  of  such  a 
victory  is  reserved  for the  working classes.  When time  shall be ripe  for their recog 
nised  entry  upon  the  stage  of  political  action,  there  will  be  within  the  lists  three  25 
powerful  classes  confronting  each  other—the  first  representing  the land;  the  second, 
money;  the third,  labor. And as the second is triumphing over the first,  so, in its turn, 
it  must  yield  before  its  successor  in  the  field  of  political  and  social  conflict.

The  whole  system  of  Class  Government  in  Britain  hinges  upon  the  political  sub 
serviency  of  the  middle-class  to  the  aristocracy.  The  middle-class  have  the  power, 
and lack only the will, to take a political position befitting their influence in the State ; 
but to do so would involve the overthrow of Class Government, and necessarily bring 
about considerable  changes in the time-honored British Constitution. Any symptoms, 
therefore,  that  the  middle-class  are  beginning  to  entertain  a  sense  of  independence 
and  self-respect in the  presence  of  the  aristocracy  are worth observing, not so much 
for  themselves  as  for  the  consequences  that  are  certain  to  result  from  the  state  of 
public  sentiment  which  they  attest.  The  refusal  of  the  empty dignity of  knighthood 
by  Stephenson  and  Dargan is  one  such  symptom, but manifestations of middle-class 
independence  have  been  very frequent of  late  in  the framing and working of Liberal 
Ministries  into  which  a  pure  middle-class  element  is  now  sure  to  enter.

Eight  years  ago,  in the  flush  of  his  free  trade  triumph,  middle-class  Cobden was 
offered by  the  Whig  aristocracy the place of Under Secretary to the Board of Trade, 
without  a  seat  in  the  Cabinet.  He refused  it because  it was  beneath his  dignity;  and 
middle-class  public  opinion  applauded  him for that  act.  Middle-class  Milner Gibson, 
the  Radical  Member  for  Manchester,  accepted  the  place,  but  soon  resigned  it  as 
incompatible  with his  political independence;  and  he  rose in consequence in middle-
class  estimation.  In the present Ministry the antagonism of the two elements—aristo 
cratic  and  middle-class—has  been  far  more  conspicuous  than  ever  before,  and  has 
reached  a  pitch  that  has  made  it  a  serious  impediment  to  the  harmonious  working 
of the  Cabinet.  His aristocratic  Lordship, Palmerston, undertook to alter in a material 
particular  a  bill relating to  the  Poor  Laws, which had been drawn up  and  brought in 
25  by  his  middle-class  colleague,  Mr. Baines,  without  deeming  it  worth  his  while  to 
consult  a  subordinate  like  Baines  on  the  matter;  and  Mr. Baines,  feeling  himself 
snubbed,  resigned.  Public  opinion  said  he  was  right  and  Palmerston  wrong.  Lord 
Palmerston  apologizes,  and  Mr. Baines  resumes  his office, having taught aristocracy 
a lesson.  Lord  Palmerston  says,  jauntily from his  seat in Parliament, that his  middle-
30  class  colleague, Mr. Wilson, had talked "sheer nonsense," while the Radical member 
of  the  ministry,  Molesworth,  in  answering  Lord  Palmerston  on  the ballot  question, 
declares  that  he  (Palmerston)  had  only  "gone  over  arguments  which  he  had  heard 

583 

The  English  Middle  Class  (Second Article) 

urged in Parliament usque ad nauseam." In the first instance, public opinion says Lord 
Palmerston  was  impertinent,  and  in  the  second  that Molesworth held  the  right tone. 
Molesworth  was  becoming unpopular  and  suspected  at the  time,  but this  hit  set him 
straight  again.  While  in  the  House  Lord  John  Russell  makes  one  of  his  solemnest 
constitutional  appeals  on  behalf  of  Church-rates:  in the  lobby  he  discovers  that the 
Attorney-General  and  the middle-class  element of his Ministry have contumaciously 
divided  against  him  to  a  man;  and  Lord  John  Russell  finds  himself  considerably 
damaged  by  his  position  on this  question. The  climax was reached when wealthy but 
parvenu  Mr. Strutt  was  unceremoniously  begged  to  resign  the  Chancellorship  of the 
Duchy  of  Lancaster  to  make  way  for  Lord  Granville,  he,  himself,  not  having been 
consulted till all had been agreed upon.  When Strutt made his simple and gentlemanly 
explanation  to  the  House,  an  explanation  in  which  his  wounded  feelings  struggled 
with  that  higher  pride  which  forbade  him  to  give  expression to it,  the  cheers  of the 
House  and  the  sympathy  of  the  journals  let  him  know  that  his  case  had  touched  a 
responsive  chord  in  the  public  breast,  and  that  the  middle-class  resented  his  insult 
as  their  own.  Not  again  will  the  Whig  Aristocracy  venture  to  outrage  middle-class 
sentiment by  such  cavalier treatment  of  their  representative.  When the  middle-class 
of  England  are  prepared  to  throw  off  the  yoke  of  Feudalism,  they  will  have  the 
example  of their ancestors of the  17th century to embolden them. Let them take heart 
and  imitate  the  men  of  the  Long  Parliament  and  the  Commonwealth.

The  Coburgs 

New-York  Daily Tribune. 
Nr.3991, I.Februar 1854 

The  Coburgs. 

Public  opinion  in  England  is  excessively exasperated against Prince Albert,  charging 
him  with  extending  his  influence  from  the  royal  drawing  room  and  chamber  to  the 
Cabinet  Councils,  and  even  with  divulging  to  his  German  kindred  and  friends  the 
secrets  of  the  Government  concerning  the  momentous  Eastern  question.  He  is  ac 
cused of being devoted to Russian interests, opposed to war, and very cold with regard 
to the  French alliance.  It is even said that this undue and unconstitutional interference 
will  be  brought  before  the  next  meeting  of  Parliament,  and  that  the  well-known 
Mr. Roebuck is to be the  accuser on this occasion. Prince Albert is charged with doing 
all  this,  if  not  for  the  further  aggrandizement  of  his  family,  at  least  for  the  con 
solidation  of  the  Coburgs  in  the  various  positions  occupied  by  them  throughout 
Europe.

These  Coburgs  are  petty princes  belonging to  the  innumerable  sprouts of German 
ruling families  who trace  back their  common  origin to  Wittikind the  Saxon,  for long 
years  an undaunted  antagonist of  Charlemagne.  Their principal branch is  now fixed 
among the  green hills  extending  on both  sides  of the  Thuringian forest,  in the Duke 
dom  of  Coburg  and  Gotha,  over  which rules  the  elder brother  of  the  accused Prince 
Consort.  This  monarchy  is  composed  of  about  185  square  miles  of land, with some 
150,000  inhabitants.  The  yearly  revenues  of  the  State  amount  to  $160,000,  with  a 
20  promising  yearly  deficit,  and  an  old  debt  of  $1,700,000.  The  military  force  consists 
of  from  fifteen  hundred  to  two  thousand  men.  The  country is  generally fertile,  well 
watered and cultivated.  The Coburgs were once a rather warlike race, and one of them 
was  a  distinguished  commander  in  the  German  armies  during  the  wars  in  the  last 
century  between  the  Emperors  and  the  Turks.  During  the  recent  convulsions  in 
25  Germany,  the  present  reigning  Duke  showed  some  martial  impulses  in  the  war  be 
tween  Holstein  and Denmark,  in  which  he  took part.  As  a  volunteer  he  commanded 
a part of  the  army and  contributed to the  capture of the Danish frigate Gefion, which 
now forms  the  principal  strength  of the Prussian navy.  This campaign had, however, 
an  ulterior  purpose.  The  German  Imperial  Crown had  been  proclaimed  vacant,  and 
the  Diet  of  Frankfort  was  looking  around  for  some  one  to  offer  it  to.  Coburg  was 
simply  trying  to  win  the  purple  with  the  sword  in  this  popular  war  of  Holstein. 

30 

But  the  prominent qualifications  of  this  race  seem  to  consist  mainly  in furnishing 

587 

Wilhelm  Pieper 

5 

fathers  for  the  breed  of  royal  lineages  in  Europe.  The  Coburgs  are generally hand 
some,  vigorous  and  well  proportioned  fellows.  The  first  to  start  in  this  new  career 
was  the  present  Leopold  of  Belgium,  who  is  now  called  the  Ulysses  of  European 
kings.  He  is  an  uncle of Prince Albert, and, as it is  said, his political adviser. Leopold 
is now 63 years old. In his youth he married the Princess Charlotte Augusta, daughter 
of  George  the  IVth,  King  of  England,  and eventual heiress  to  the  Crown.  She  died, 
however,  in  the  year  1817.  The  second  wife  of  Leopold  was  a  daughter  of  Louis 
Philippe,  who  died  nearly  two  years  ago.  His  son  and  heir  has  lately  married  an 
Austrian  arch-duchess.  Prince  Albert  followed  luckily in the footsteps  of his uncle. 
Born  in  1819,  after  having  finished  his  studies  at  the  University  of  Bonn,  he  went  10 
in  search  of  fortune,  and  landed  in  the  royal apartments  of  Windsor  Castle.  One  of 
his  uncles  married in  1816 a Princess  Cohary, a rich Hungarian heiress, and from this 
marriage  issued,  first,  Ferdinand,  the  husband  of  the  deceased  Maria  de  Gloria  of 
Portugal, now  King Regent there;  second,  Auguste, married to Princess Clementine, 
daughter of Louis Philippe ; and third, the Princess Victoria, now the wife of the Duke 15 
of  Nemours.  An  aunt  of  Prince  Albert  was  in  1796  married  to  the  Grand  Duke 
Constantine,  elder  brother  of the  Emperor  Nicholas,  and was  divorced in  1820.  For 
nearly forty years  she has lived in Switzerland, with the advantages of a considerable 
income  paid  from  Russia.  She  is  72  years  old.  Another aunt of  Albert  was  the  wife 
of the Duke  of  Kent;  she  is  the mother of  Queen Victoria,  and this royal match was 
made  between  two  cousins. 

20 

All  these  intermarriages  easily  point  out  what  are  the  Coburgs'  interests,  and  in 
what  direction  they  use  their  influence.  It  cannot  suit them to  strengthen  Napoleon 
and  thus  endanger  the  independence  of  Belgium.  They  must propitiate  the  good will 
of Nicholas, and at any rate avert ageneral war whose results must be deeply injurious 
to  their  tribe.

Different  Features  of  Popular  Feeling

The  East  and  West  of  Europe  alike  present  new  features  of  peculiar  interest.  In 
Turkey  and  in  Spain,  new,  but vastly  different features  of  popular feeling  are  rising 
to  the  surface.  A  feeling of  doubt,  mistrust,  and  hostility  against  their western  allies 
is gaining possession of the Turkish mind.  They begin to look on France and  England 
as  more  dangerous enemies  than the  Czar himself,  and  the  general  cry is—"they  are 
going to  dethrone the Sultan, and divide the land"—"they are going to make us  slaves 
to  the  Christian  population."  It must be  said  that  there  appears  some  ground  for the 
accusation.  Landing  south  of  Constantinople  instead  of  north  of  Varna  they  are 
fortifying Galipoli as though against the  Turks  themselves.  The tract of land on which 
that village is  situated is a long peninsula joined by a narrow isthmus to the continent, 
and  admirably  adapted  for  a  stronghold  for  invaders.  It  was  there  the  Genoese  of 
old defied the Greek Emperors of Constantinople. The appointment of the new Sheik 
ul  Islam  is  filling  the  true  Moslemim  with  indignation,  since  he  is  little  better  than 
a tool  of  the  Greek priesthood,  and  a  strong feeling is  pervading the Turks of  sooner 
15  yielding  to  the  one  demand of  Nicholas  than being made  the  playthings  of  a knot of 
greedy  powers.  On  this  subject  they  have  made  a  fable.  "Menchikoff,"  say  they, 
"came  to  Constantinople  and  asked  for  the  Koran.  He  looked  at  the  book,  marked 
several  passages,  and  said,  'Erase  these.'  The  English  and  French  then  came  and 
asked  also  for the Koran. After reading, they  said,  'Throw this book into the Bospho-
r u s . '" 

20 

Austria is  pouncing upon  Servia.  Greece  is  intent on Thessaly  and Epirus. France 
on Egypt—England on Canada and the islands.  To obtain these, Russia would receive 
more  than  the  Principalities  in  compromise.  "What,"  say  the  Turks,  "What further 
could we  lose to the  Czar? Nay, he would not take from us half as much, if, by yielding 
to  him,  we  get  rid  of  our  hateful  and  treacherous  allies." 

25 

Meanwhile,  the  district  north of the Balkan is utterly exhausted of provisions;  and 
those  supplies that might be  sent from the  south are  now actually stopped to maintain 
the  French  and  English  soldiers.  So  unprovided  have  the  allies  come,  that,  few  as 
have  yet  arrived,  they  are obliged to borrow Turkish tents.  It must take at least three 
30  months  before  they will be  able to  get as  far  north as  Varna, which they might have 
reached  in  a  few  days  by  sea;  a  clear  proof  that  they  do  not  intend  to  fight  the 
Russians,  but  to  gag  the  Turks.  The  French  and  English  officers  are  out  of  spirits, 
and  the  only  feat  they  have  as  yet  achieved  is  to  turn  some  poor  Dervishes  out  of 
their  convent  at  Galipoli,  and  instai  themselves  instead. 

589 

Ernest Jones 

The Turks, on the other hand,  are expelling the Greek population,  subjects of King 
Otho.  About  fifty  thousand  will  be  driven  from  Constantinople  and  its  neighbour 
hood;  an ill-judged  measure,  since  they only go  to  greaten the  insurrectionary force 
of  Greece.  Immense  bodies  of Russians  are on the right bank of the Danube, and the 
Pasha  of  Varna  has  only  3,000  men  in  his  fortress,  to  defend  which  12,000  are  re- 
quired. 

5 

Terrible  excesses  are  being  perpetrated  by  the  irregular  Turkish  troops,  on  their 
retreat,  who  burnt  the  city  of  Kostendje in retiring.  The Russians,  however,  appear 
resolved,  after  they  shall  have  extended  their  operations  to  an  impregnable  line  of 
defence, to  act on the defensive, and throw the difficult task of aggression upon their  10 
enemies,  leaving  the  latter  as  best  they  may  to  grapple  with  famine  and  disease, 
sowing  dissension  between  the  allies,  and  creating  distrust  towards  them  in  the 
Turkish  mind. 

Fokshani,  in  Wallachia,  has  been  destroyed  by  fire,  with  all  the  Russian  stores, 

hospital,  and  ammunition. 

In this  terrible  emergency,  the  Duke  of  Cambridge  has  been feasting at Paris, and 
now,  instead  of  going  by  sea,  must  needs  travel  by  land  through  Vienna,  where  he 
will  delay  among fresh festivals  and balls. The Austrian Emperor's marriage is about 
to take place in a few days,  and his  ambassador in Paris has deserted his post to dance 
attendance  at the wedding. 

The  Turkish  army  in Asia is being slowly re-organised, but the terrible  snow keeps 
the  forces  of  Prince  Woronzoff  inactive.  The  Russian  fleet  maintains  undisputed 
possession of the Black Sea, and has just performed one of the most brilliant achieve 
ments,  by  taking  off  all its  garrisons  from  the  Circassian forts in the  actual presence 
of  two  British frigates. 

In  the  Baltic,  the  Russian  fleet  is  scattered  in different ports.  The  Czar is  seeking 
to  re-unite  his  ships  beneath  the  guns  of  Cronstadt.  Nine  Russian  ships  of  the  line 
are preparing to leave  Sweaborg. We  shall see whether Admiral Napier thinks proper 
to intercept them.  A few Russian  merchantmen have been taken as prizes by Admiral 
Plumridge.

In the West of  Europe matters look most promising. Discontent spreads  in France, 
unfortunately  at  the  cost  of  suffering.  Trade  is  excessively  dull,  and  scarcity  keeps 
threatening.  It is  an ominous fact, which the French government has tried to suppress, 
that  the  African  troops,  on landing  at  Malta,  replied  to  the  "God  Save  the  Queen" 
of  the  British  regimental  bands,  by  the  "Marseillaise,"  the proscribed  and  penal  air  35 
of  the  revolution! 

But it is in Spain where the most important movement of the week has taken place. 
We  last  week  recorded  the  turn-out of 40,000 operatives  in Barcelona,  and the  sup 
pression  of  the  unarmed  movement  by  the  military force.  Since  then,  churches  and. 
factories  have burst out in  conflagration,  and the leaders of the turn-out have issued  40 
an  address  to  the  people,  in  which  they  state  that they had  advised them  to  resume 
work  in  expectation  that  their  grievances  would  have  been  redressed.  Deceived  in 
that  expectation,  they  now  call  on  them  to  turn-out  again,  and trust  in  their  cause, 
and  their  own  arms.  Five  thousand  muskets  have  been  landed  at  Arenys  del  Mar. 
The  terrified  authorities released  all the prisoners  they had made,  excepting twelve, 

45 

590 

Different  Features  of  Popular  Feeling 

but  the  people  insisted  upon  the  liberation  of  these  as  well.  At  Saragossa  a terrific 
ferment  reigns.  In  reply  to  it  the  government  has  amnestied  the  military  prisoners. 
But  the  best  feat  was  that  performed  by  the  Queen  and  King,  who  washed  the  feet 
of  twelve  old  women  and  twelve  old  men,  and  then  waited  on  them  at  dinner.  The 
5  Queen,  however,  was  so  frightened  at  the  Duke  of  Parma's  assassination,  that  she 

abandoned  her  intention  of  visiting  the  churches  on  foot. 

The  financial  crisis  in  Spain is unparalleled. There has been a terrible run upon the 
Bank  of  San  Fernando,  and  the  Government  have  sought  to  meet  their  difficulties 
by  asking  the  people  to  pay  a  quarter's  taxes  in  advance. 

10 

America seems determined to take advantage of the difficulties of Spain by picking 
a  quarrel  about  Cuba.  The  Spaniards  have  replied  by  ordering  every  slave  to  be 
registered, as  a check upon the  slave trade, and allowing free labour of all description, 
to  be  imported.  They  even  hint that  they  would  sooner liberate the  slave population, 
and  make  it  another  San  Domingo,  than  allow  it  to  pass  into  the  hands  of  the 

15  Americans.

How often, when the  stern observer of events  sees through the abominable treachery 
of  those  in power,  the people laugh at him who exposes it!  How reluctant the  masses 
are  to  believe  that their  enemies  are their enemies, and that their friends  can be their 
friends.  How  easily  a  few  soft  words,  or  an  artful  stroke  of  policy  on  the  part  of 
government,  disarms  the  resentment,  or  blinds  the  judgment  of  the  governed!  If 
cabinets  are  forced  into  a  war  against  their  own  will,  they  get  credit for  energy.  If, 
after  infamous  treacheries,  they  are  compelled  to  let their  armies  fight  a battle,  and 
the  courage  of  their  soldiers  conquer,—who  gets  the  laurel  and  the  praise?  Not  the 
people  who  drove  them, but the  ministry that had to  be  driven.  Not the  soldier who  10 
fought,  but  the  vile  official  clique  that  caused  him  to  fight  at  an  inconceivable  dis 
advantage,  and  suffer  a  loss  that  earlier  action  might have  avoided  altogether.  And 
such  is  the  gullibility  of  the  people,  that  they  can't believe that "great  men"  can be 
great  scoundrels.  "Why  should  lords,  and  peers,  and  princes  betray  u s ?"  they  cry. 
Why?  To  save  their  infamous  rule from extermination at the hands  of  mankind.  To 
prevent  the people  rising  anywhere—lest they  should rise  everywhere.  Why? Because 
existing  government  is  the  art  of  murdering  soul  and  body,  destroying  the  morals, 
perverting  the  intellect,  and  abasing  the  manhood  of  the  many for the  advantage  of 
the few.  Because existing governments are the triumph of organised rebellion against 
God  and  man.  Because  existing  governments  are  the  science  of  making  miserable  20 
the  greatest possible  number for the benefit of the  smaZ/esrpossible number.  Because, 
in the words of democratic Luther,  "What are  'great men'?—great knaves, who fatten 
on  the  credulity  and  misery  of  the  people.  Princes  and  thieves,  you know,  are  syn 
onymous terms." Because, if one  of them is  exposed and falls—if the tree of freedom 
is  planted  in  the  heart  of  one  dead tyrant,—every nation will rush to  pluck the fruit. 
Do  you  believe  that  those  who  oppress  at  home,  can  ever  fight  heartily  against  an 
oppressor  abroad?  Yes—they  may  in  those  ages,  and  in  those  countries,  in  which 
democracy  does  not  exist—in  which  the  people  are  ignorant  and  blind.  Russia  may 
risk a war with hearty  strokes, having nothing to fear in its interior.  Austria, England, 
Prussia,  France,  Denmark,  Sweden,  and  the  lesser  German powers  dare  not.  Their  30 
wars  are  tricks  and  shams,  and  their  every  step  a  base  delusion  for  the  people.

When Palmerston and Aberdeen, Russell and his  colleagues, were exposed in these 

592 

Discoveries Made Too Late 

columns,  how  many  were  disinclined to believe in the treachery we denounced!  And 
now  that  active  operations  have  been forced  on  our  rulers  by the threatened mutiny 
of the  French  army,  (an army on whose allegiance Napoleon's throne depends), how 
many  more  are  ready  to  become  the  dupes  of  the  vile  Whig-Liberal  cabal!

Let  a  terrible  warning  of  the  past  show  you what British governments  are, were, 

and  will  be,  so  long  as  they  are  the  nominees  of  mere  class  legislation:— 

10 

England took part in the  seven years' war,  as  an ally of  Frederick the  "Great," of 
Prussia.  France  was  the  opponent  against whom England and Prussia fought.  At this 
time  there  was  a  stronger democratic  action in this  country than there  has, perhaps, 
ever  been  since  Junius  wrote  his  famous  letters,  and  Wilkes  made  aristocracy  and 
the  House  of  Guelph,  tremble  for  their  position.  Lord  Bute was  "our"  minister,  the 
Duke  of  Choiseulwas  the  minister  of  Louis  XV.,  and  Marshal  Belleisle commanded 
the  armies  of  France.  The  French  had  been  beaten  out  of  Wilhelmsthal,  and  had 
retired  across  the  Fulda.  Triumph  was  waiting for the  arms  of the allies.  What hap-
15  pened  then?  Revolutions  are  strange  things,  and the last French change  has  shaken 
the  following  facts  out  of  the  Archives  of France,  and they have been printed by the 
French  people.  The  British  government  desired  peace;  the  Guelphs  trembled  for 
Hanover,  and,  above  all,  the  aristocracy trembled before  the  democratic  action that 
was beginning to pervade the masses  in England, and the  stir preparatory to the great 
Irish  insurrection.  The  English  minister,  Lord Bute,  therefore,  wrote  to  the  French 
minister,  the  Duke  de  Choiseul,  chiding  him  for  letting  the  French be  so  easily  dis 
couraged,  and retreating  across  the  Fulda; telling him,  "unless  you beat us,  we  dare 
not conclude  a peace. Why do you let yourselves be  so beaten?"  and urging the Duke 
to let Marshal Belleisle with the French army advance once more, and that the English 
forces  should  be  played  into  his  hands  and  destroyed!  So  complete was the under 
standing,  that  the  French  generals—the  generals  who  were  fighting  against  us—re 
ceived  their  orders  from  the  English  ministry,  direct  from  London! 

25 

20 

The  correspondence  has  now  been  extracted  from  the  Archives  des  Affaires 

Étrangères  de  France. 

30 

These  discoveries  are  made  too  late.  Had they been made  at the time  (1762), had 
Wilkes  and  his  friends  been  able  then  to  prove  these  facts,  there  would  have  been 
a  revolution,  and  the  House  of  Guelph been  sent back like  scared  rats  to  their  petty 
German sinks of f lunkeyism and oppression. But, on the contrary, when victory was 
gained  against the  ministry's  will,  the  ministers  were  praised for vigour; when peace 
35  was  concluded  after  reverse  and  defeat,  caused  by  such  infamous  treason,  the 
ministers  were  praised  for  their  prudence  and  moderation!  So  goes  the  world. 

But,  to  prove  that  nothing  good  can come  (not  out of  Nazareth, but out of  Whig-
Liberalism  and  aristocratic  democracy),  we  will  give  an instance  of treachery from 
the  other  side—the  drunken  sham-radical  Fox.  This  man  sent  a private  ambassador 
to Catherine of Russia, in 1792, exhorting her to take and partition Poland, and telling 
her  that  if  Pitt  tried  to  prevent  it,  he  would  be  turned  out  of  office  on  the  instant!

What  say  you  now  to  "our"  Governments?  Sending  our  armies  to  the  field,  and 
instructing the generals  opposed to them how to  destroy them!  Going to war, because 
the  people  force  them ;  and  then having a private understanding with the enemy that 

45

he  shall  not  be  injured,  but  that their  own army  shall be  wasted away.  Positively, it 
is  just  as  though the  present government were  to  have  said  to  Turkey,  "Don't resist 
Russia;"  and  to  Russia,  "Go  on!  Cross  the  Pruth,  and  take  them  unprepared."  As 
though  they  had  said  to  Turkey,  when  Turkey  was  resolved  to  fight,  "We'll  send 
succour;  don't  do  anything  till  we  come;"  and  to  Russia,  "We'll keep them waiting 
so  long,  that  you  will  be  able  to  bring  up  an  overwhelming  force."  As  though  they 
had  said to  Omar Pasha,  "Let Silistria fall;"  and to Russia,  "Go on with the siege—the 
place  shall  not  be  relieved."  As  though  they  had  sent  a  fleet  to  the  Baltic,  under  a 
secret  understanding  with  the  Czar  that-it  should  do  nothing.  As  though,  when  the 
people  clamoured,  they had  said  to  the Czar, "We must do  something, where can we  10 
strike to hurt you least?" and the Czar had answered, "Bomarsund!" As though, when 
the  French  army  compelled  an  attack  on  Sebastopol,  it  had  been  prearranged  with 
Nicholas  that  the  Russians  should  take  a  strong  position,  which  they  could  defend 
with  little  loss,  and  which  could  be  taken only with great  slaughter.  As  though they 
intentionally  had  no  cavalry,  (which  could have been embarked as  well  as  infantry, 
and  in  the  room  of  some  of  the  latter  that  was  useless),  in  order  that  the  Russians 
might retreatwith little injury, and so as to lose only three of their 100 guns ! ! As though 
it had been then arranged that the allies should make a promenade around Sebastopol, 
and 15,000 Russians come on the English, the English come on 25,000 Russians, "quite 
unawares,"  while  each  was  trying  to  get  out  of  the  way  of  the  other.  As  though by  20 
mutual  consent,  the  allies  were  to  leave  the  northern  forts  of  Sebastopol (the  most 
important)  in  the  hands  of  the  Russians,—those  forts  being  next  to  Russia,  open  to 
the  Russian  reinforcements,  and  commanding the  town,  harbour,  and  southern forts 
of  Sebastopol,  which  thus  become  untenable to  the  allies; whereas,  if  the  allies  had 
taken  the  northern forts  of the  harbour,  they would have interposed between Sebas- 
topol  and Russia,  and  cut it  off from all reinforcements.  As though, having given the 
Czar  time to fortify  Sebastopol,  which was  almost totally unfortified  on the land  side 
during  the  summer,  and  postponed  the  attack  to  the  unhealthy  season,  they  had 
ensured  the  crippling  of  our  army  by  ball,  bayonet,  and  disease,  and pre-concerted 
with  the  enemy  that,  after  perhaps  storming  a  few  bastions  and  entrenchments  on  30 
the  south,  they  should  re-embark,  while  the  Russians  fired the  last  shots  after  their 
retiring  fleet,  and  at  once  re-occupied  and  restored  the  fortifications  that had  been 
destroyed.  As  though—as  though—what?  Simply,  as  though the  present government 
of  aristocratic-royalist-liberals  acted  in  the  same  way  in which all aristocratic-royal 
ist-liberals  and  tories  have  always  acted before  them—that  is  all.

I  accuse no  one. No  doubt Lord Aberdeen shudders  at the  horrors  of war; and that 
is  the  reason  why  our gallant  soldiers  are  without  surgeons,  medicines,  and lint.  No 
doubt  Lord  Palmerston  intends  to  destroy  despotism;  and that is  why he  sacrificed 
Poland,  Cracow,  Hungary,  Portugal,  Lombardy,  Naples,  Sicily, Rome,  Venice,  and 
the  people  of  Austria,  Prussia,  Baden,  Bavaria,  Saxony,  and  Holstein,  to  despots—  40 
though  he  is  the  "friend  of  Kossuth's  bosom."  No  doubt  Sir  James  Graham  loves 
the  patriots  of  Italy;  though by  felony  on their  letters, the  act of a common thief and 
the  most  depraved  spy,  he  basely  betrayed their noblest to the hangman's hands.  No 
doubt Russell has  a vigorous policy; though he  appeals to the restoration of the status 
quo; then repudiates  it;  then talks  of taking  Sebastopol; then denies  his  words; then  45

Discoveries  Made Too  Late 

beholds  the  British forced  by  French  mutiny  to  sail,  and march,  and fight;  and when 
asked  what  we're  fighting  for,  and  what  he  means,  says  we've no  fixed  object,  but 
that  must  depend  on  the  position  of  the  armies  and  the  events  of  the  campaign! 
Unparalleled  confession  of  imbecility  and  disgraceful  incompetence.  No  doubt they 
"all  are  honourable  men;"  but  the  sooner  we  get  rid  of  them  the  better,  and  see,  to 
the great glory of our commonwealth,  a Blake lead our fleets,  a Cromwell our armies, 
and  a  Hampden  presiding  in  our Senate  Halls.

b.  The  officers  of  the  several bodies  of working men who  act in conjunction with 

the  Mass  Movement forward  the  monies  thus  raised  to  its  directing  head. 

20 

II.—Security  of  the  Funds 
a.  The local officers forward weekly all monies they receive on behalf of the Mass 
Movement  to  the  directing head of the  same, as  shall be further  specified below.  The 
duly  appointed  officers for the reception of the  same return receipts  immediately for 
the  monies  thus  received. 

b.  The  directing  heads  shall  invest  all  monies  they  receive  on behalf of the  Mass 
25  Movement  (having  power  to  retain  in  hand  a  sum  not  exceeding  £50)  in  a  Bank, in 
their  collective  names;  no  such  sum  or  sums,  nor  any part of  the  same, to  be  drawn 
out  of  the  Bank,  except  on presentation of the  minute books  of the  said Executive, 

599 

Programme of the  Labour Parliament 

containing  an  order  for  the  same  to  be  drawn,  signed by four-fifths  of  the  members 
of  that  body. 

c. The  money  thus  drawn  shall  be  paper  money  (unless  under  £50);  the  numbers 
of  such  notes  shall  be  entered  in  a  book,  open  to  inspection,  and  published  in  the 
papers;  the  notes  thus  received  shall  be  cut  into  parts,  and each part entrusted  to  a 
separate  member  of  the  directing  body,  and,  where  large  sums  are  drawn,  be  held 
in  equal  proportions  by  each  member. 

5 

d.  Each  member  thus  entrusted  with  a  portion  of  the  said  money  shall  give  a 
promissory note amounting to his proportionate  share of the money drawn supposing 
the  same  divided  into  equal parts,  according to  the  numbers  of  the  directing body;  10 
and,  should he refuse to  apply for the purposes for which the money was  drawn such 
part  of  note  held  by  him,  the  document  thus  held  against  him  shall  at  once  be  put 
in force, but be  cancelled  on his  paying over said part of note. The promissory notes 
thus  given shall be  deposited in a chest or  safe, which  shall be  placed in the custody 
of  an independent and responsible person, not a member of the Executive, who shall 
not  allow  any  document  to  be  taken  therefrom,  except  in  presence  of  four-fifths  of 
that body;  the  said notes  shall be  made  payable to a duly-appointed party, who shall 
give  a written  undertaking  that,  in  case  of  default,  they  may  be  acted  on. 

15 

e. The  money  thus drawn for any payment or purchase  shall be paid by the Execu 

tive  only  in  the  mutual  presence  of  each member  of  the  body,  if  the  sum  exceeds  20 
£50. 

III.—Application  of  the  Funds. 
a.  To  support  all  towns  or  places  now  or  hereafter on  strike  or  locked-out,  that 
recognise  the  Mass  Movement,  or  may  hereafter  do  so.  Equal  support  shall  be 
afforded  to  all  towns  in  proportion  to  the  numbers  on  strike  or  locked-out.  On the  25 
same  principle  on  which,  when  provisions  run  short  on  board  of  ship  all  receive 
alike,  the  same  relief  shall  be  given  without  distinction  of  high  or  low  paid  trades, 
with the  exceptions  hereafter  mentioned  in the Constitution of the Mass  Movement. 
In  order  to  provide  a  separate  fund for  liquidating the  debts  incurred  by  strikes  and 
lock-outs  during  the  last  twelve  months,  and  a fund for the future  defence  of those 
who  may  be  victimised  by  employers,  every person  on  becoming  a  member  of the 
Mass  Movement  shall  pay  one  penny,  and  one  penny  quarterly,  so  long  as  he  or 
she  shall  continue  a  member  of  the  same. 

30 

b. A department shall be opened for regulating the price of labour. For this purpose 
a  monthly  statement  shall be issued of the  price  of the raw  material employed in all  35 
the  trades  in  connexion  with  the  Mass  Movement;  the  price  of  labour  in the  same, 
the  selling  price  of  the  articles  produced,  and  the  other  working  charges.  On  the 
evidence  thus  furnished,  the  directing  body  shall  issue  a  statement of  the  profits  of 
the  employers;  being  open to  receive  from  the  latter  a statement of any peculiar and 
additional  charges  which  they  (the employers) may have to meet.  On the basis thus  40 
laid, the price of labour  shall be regulated, and a tariff of wages be fixed in accordance 
with  the  same.  A  similar  plan  shall  be  applied  to  the  agricultural  interests  of  the 
country. 

c.  While  the  working-man  has  an  undoubted  right  to  participate  in  the  profits  of 

600 

Programme  of the  Labour Parliament 

the  employer,  he  has  a  right  higher  still,—that  of  employing  himself;  and  for  the 
purpose  of  self-employment,  as  also  for  the  purpose of more  effectually regulating 
wages by removing the power of surplus labour from the employers' hands, the funds 
of  the  Mass  Movement shall be further applied in the purchase of land. The estates 
shall be purchased in the names of 
individuals not being members of the directing 
body. The estates  shall be divided into farms, varying in size according to the nature 
of the soil, and the purposes to which they are to be applied, viz., whether as individual 
tenancies or large co-operative undertakings. The said lands shall be retained by, and 
never  alienated from the  Mass  Movement.  That the  land be  let to  tenants  on short 
leases,  and  at a fair  and moderate  rental. A clause be inserted in the lease whereby 
any  tenant  making  default  in  payment  of  rent  shall  immediately  lose  his  right  of 
tenancy.  That  a fourth  clause  be  inserted  whereby  the  tenant  binds  himself  to  pay 
the  rental  to  the  parties  appointed  by the  deed of assignment hereafter named.  The 
parties in whose names the estates are bought execute a deed of assignment, whereby 
the tenant shall pay the rent, not to them, but to the individuals then being directors 
of the Mass Movement. The directors of the Mass Movement for the time being shall 
execute  a deed  binding themselves in a penalty  of £5,000 each to two individuals not 
being  purchasers  of  any  of  the  estates,  such penalty  to  be  enforced  should  they,  on 
leaving office,  not execute a deed of assignment of the  said rental to their successors 
in office; to be forfeited  should they, at a given time, to be identical with that of the 
expiration  of  office,  not  execute  a  deed of  assignment of the  same rental  to  certain 
individuals  being their  successors  in  office,  the details hereof to be  specified in the 
constitution  of  the  Mass  Movement. 

5 

10 

15 

20 

The  title  deeds  of  the  property  bought  shall be  deposited with the bankers of the 
25  Mass  Movement—not  to  be  given up  except to  persons  appointed for  that  purpose 
at a meeting of the Labour Parliament of the said Movement, consisting of representa 
tives  from  not  less  than thirty organised  and previously recognised branches  of the 
same.  Each  estate  shall  be  bought  in  the  names  of  the  two  individuals,  not  being 
members of the executive; the  said individuals not to purchase  a second estate until 
they have deposited the deeds of the first with the bankers of the Mass Movement. 

30 

d.  That  independent  self-employment  and  relief  of  the  labour  market  from  its 
surplus be  still more  secure, the available fund shall be applied for the establishment 
of co-operative factories, workshops, and stores, such to be the property of the Mass 
Movement. 

35 

Those  employed therein  shall receive,  as far as practicable,  that amount of wages 
regulated  by  the  tariff  for  the  price  of  labour,  previously  named,  and  one-third  of 
the net profits realised on the articles produced and  sold, the other third of the profits 
to  go  to  the  revenue  of  the  Mass  Movement. 

The  chief  manager of each co-operative  undertaking be  elected by the  operatives 

40 

engaged  therein,  subject to  the  approbation  of  the  directing body. 

The  said manager of each respective undertaking shall regulate the purchases and 
sales  connected  therewith,  and  return  weekly to  the  directing  body  a  statement  of 
the  purchases,  sales,  payments,  and loss  or  profit  connected  with the  same. 

In  case  grounds  of  complaint  or  differences  arise  between  the  operatives  and 
45  manager, the operatives  shall have the power of dismissing the manager and electing 

601 

Programme  of the  Labour  Parliament 

another  by  a  majority  of  not  less  than three-fourths  of  their  number.  Two-thirds  of 
the  net  profits  of  each  co-operative  undertaking  shall  be  sent  monthly  by  each  re 
spective  manager  to  the  directing  body.  The  property  for  co-operative  purposes 
purchased  by  the  Mass  Movement  be  placed  under  a  system  of  security  similar  to 
that  applied to  the  landed  estates. 

5 

IV.—Labour  Legislation. 
The  power  of  this  Movement  shall  be  further exerted to  secure  a due restriction of 
the  hours  of  labour;  a limitation  of  female  labour  in  manufacture,  as  also  an entire 
abolition  of  the  labour  of  young  children  in  mines  and  factories;  a cessation of  the 
tyrannical  system  of  discharge  notes,  of fines,  abatements,  and  other unjust  modes  10 
of reducing wages;  of the truck system, of the silent system in factories, of the custom 
of locking operatives up in the  same, and of all the inhuman machinery of oppression 
now  in  excercise  against  the  employed  in  all  branches  of  industry. 

V—Constitution  of  the  Mass  Movement. 
a.  Membership:  The  payments  as  already  specified;  each  individual  becoming  a 
member  is  entitled  to  vote  for  the  election  of  delegates  to  the  Labour  Parliaments, 
for the  election of the  officers  of the general Movement, and those of his own branch, 
as  soon  as  he  commences  paying,  but  loses  his  membership  if  one  month in  arrear 
with  payment,  except  in  proved  cases  of  non-employment  and  sickness. 

15 

b. The  Executive  shall  issue  the  following  form  for  the  collection  of  money.— 
Mass  Movement  of  the  Working  Classes.

of  the  Mass  Movement,  who,  in  a  printed  form,  will  return  a  receipt  for  the  same 
on  each  ensuing  Monday,  to  be  shown  by  the  Collectors  to  the  Members.  The  25 
Executive  will  publish  weekly  a  list  of  all  monies  received,  in  a  public  paper,  with 
the  name  of  the  branch  and  the  officers  who  forward  them.)

tive  being  bound  to  take  the  necessary  steps  for  the  same,  but  they  may  likewise 
summon  it  for  a  special  meeting,  should  they  find  it necessary;  and on the  demand

ment. 

10 

15 

b. No  strike  shall be  supported unless previously sanctioned by the Executive, who 
are hereby instructed so to regulate strikes, should any become unavoidable, that they  20 
may  not  interfere  with  each  other,  and  thus  defeat  the  general  object.

lock-outs  shall be determined by the  Executive according to circumstances; boys and 
girls  under  twelve  years  shall receive one-third, and above twelve and under sixteen,
