d em  Erscheinen  d es  ersten  Bandes  d es  „Kapitals"  (Mitte  S e p t e m b er

Abteilung  der  MEGA,  die  das  Wirken  von  Marx  und  Engels  in  der  Inter 
nationalen  Arbeiterassoziation  widerspiegeln. 

Die  Bildung  dieser  Organisation  leitete  e i ne  n e ue  Etappe  in  der  Ge 
schichte  der  Arbeiterbewegung  ein.  Sie  entwickelte  sich  zur  ersten  in 
ternationalen  Massenorganisation  der  Arbeiter.  Hatte  im  Bund  der  Kom 
munisten  bereits  e i ne  kleine  politische  Vorhut  die  Lehren  von  Marx  und 
Engels  a u f g e n o m m e n,  so  begann  in  der  I.Internationale  e i ne  Rezeption 
v on  Grundideen  d es  Marxismus  durch  die  sich  entfaltende  proletari 
s c he  M a s s e n b e w e g u n g.  In  d em  jahrzehntelangen  Verselbständigungs-

It  is  a  great  fact  t h at  the  misery  of  the  working  masses  has  n ot  d i m i n i s h ed 
from  1848  to  1864,  a nd  yet  this  period  is  unrivalled  for  the  d e v e l o p m e nt  of 
its  industry  a nd  the  growth  of its  c o m m e r c e.  In  1850,  a  m o d e r a te  organ  of 
the  British  middle-class,  of m o re  t h an  average  information,  predicted  that 
if t he  exports  a nd  i m p o r ts  of E n g l a nd  were  to  rise  50  per  cent.,  English  pau 
perism  would  sink  to  zero.  Alas!  on  April  7th,  1864,  the  Chancellor  of  the 
Exchequer  delighted  his  Parliamentary  a u d i e n ce  by  the  s t a t e m e nt  t h at  the 
total 
"to 
£443,955,000!  t h at  astonishing  s um  about  three  times  the  trade  of the  c o m 
paratively  recent  e p o ch  of  1843!"  W i th  all  that,  he  was  eloquent  u p on  "pov 
erty."  " T h i n k ,"  he  exclaimed,  "of  those  who  are  on  the  border  of  t h at  re 
gion,"  u p on  "wages  ...  n ot  increased;"  u p on  " h u m an  life  ...  in  n i ne  cases 
out  of  t en  b ut  a  struggle  of  existence!"  He  did  n ot  speak  of  the  people  of 
Ireland,  gradually  replaced  by  m a c h i n e ry  in  t he  north,  a nd  by  sheep-walks 
in  the  south,  t h o u gh  even  the  sheep  in  that  u n h a p py  country  are  decreas 
ing,  it  is  true  n ot  at  so  rapid  a  rate  as  the  m e n.  He  did  n ot  repeat  what  t h en 
h ad  b e en just  betrayed  by  the  highest  representatives  of t he  u p p er  t en  t h o u 
sand  in  a  s u d d en  fit  of terror.  W h en  the  garotte  p a n ic  h ad  reached  a  certain 
25  height,  the  H o u se  of Lords  caused  an  inquiry  to  be  m a de  i n t o,  a nd  a  report

to  be  published  u p o n,  transportation  a nd  p e n al  servitude.  O ut  c a me  t he 
m u r d er  ||4|  in  t he  bulky  Blue  Book  of  1863,  a nd  proved  it  was,  by  official 
facts  a nd  figures,  t h at  the  worst  of  the  convicted  criminals,  the  p e n al  serfs 
of E n g l a nd  a nd  Scotland,  toiled  m u ch  less  a nd  fared  far  better  t h an  t he  ag 
ricultural  labourers  of  E n g l a nd  and  Scotland.  But  this  was  n ot  all.  W h e n, 
c o n s e q u e nt  u p on  the  civil  war  in  America,  the  operatives  of  Lancashire 
a nd  Cheshire  were  thrown  u p on  the  streets,  the  same  H o u se  of  Lords  sent 
to  t he  m a n u f a c t u r i ng  districts  a  physician  c o m m i s s i o n ed  to  investigate  into 
the  smallest  possible  a m o u nt  of  carbon  a nd  nitrogen,  to  be  a d m i n i s t e r ed  in 
t he  cheapest  a nd  plainest  form,  which  on  an  average  m i g ht  j u st  suffice  to 
"avert  starvation  diseases."  Dr.  Smith,  the  m e d i c al  deputy,  ascertained  that 
28,000  grains  of  carbon,  a nd  1,330  grains  of  nitrogen  were  the  weekly  al 
lowance  that  would  keep  an  average  adult  ...  j u st  over  the  level  of  starva 
tion  diseases,  a nd  he  found  furthermore  that  quantity  pretty  nearly  to  agree 
with  t he  scanty  n o u r i s h m e nt  to  which  the  pressure  of  extreme  distress  h ad 
actually  r e d u c ed  the  cotton  operatives.*  But  now  mark!  T he  s a me  learned 
Doctor  was  later  on  again  deputed  by  the  m e d i c al  officer  of  the  Privy 
Council  to  i n q u i re  into  the  n o u r i s h m e nt  of  the  poorer  labouring  classes. 
T he  results  of  his  researches  are  e m b o d i ed  in  the  "Sixth  R e p o rt  on  Public 
Health,"  published  by  order  of Parliament  in  t he  course  of the  present  year. 
W h at  did  the  Doctor  discover?  T h at  the  silk  weavers,  the  n e e d le  w o m e n, 
the  kid  glovers,  the  stocking  weavers,  a nd  so  forth,  received,  on  an  average, 
n ot  even  the  distress  p i t t a n ce  of the  cotton  operatives,  n ot  even  the  a m o u nt 
of  carbon  and  nitrogen  "just  sufficient  to  avert  starvation  diseases."

"Moreover,"  we  quote  from  the  report,  "as  regards  the  e x a m i n ed  families

food,  a nd  t h at  in  three  counties  (Berkshire,  Oxfordshire,  a nd  Somerset 
shire)  insufficiency  of  nitrogenous  food  was  the  average  local  diet."  "It  30 
m u st  be  r e m e m b e r e d ,"  a d ds  the  official  report,  "that  privation  of  food  is 
very  reluctantly  borne,  a nd  that,  as  a  rule,  great  poorness  of  diet  will  only 
c o me  when  other  privations  have  preceded  it.  ...  Even  cleanliness  will  have 
b e en  found  costly  or  difficult,  a nd  if  there  still  be  self-respectful  endeav 
ours  to  m a i n t a in  it,  every  s u ch  endeavour will  represent  a d d i t i o n al  pangs  of  35

* We  need  hardly  remind  the  reader that,  apart  from the  elements  of water and  certain  inor 
ganic  substances,  carbon  and  nitrogen  form  the  raw  materials  of human  food.  However,  to 
nourish  the human  system,  those  simple  chemical constituents  must be  supplied in the form 
of  vegetable  or  animal  substances.  Potatoes,  for  instance,  contain  mainly  carbon,  while  40 
wheaten  bread  contains  carbonaceous  and  nitrogenous  substances  in  a  due  proportion.

bered  t h at  the  poverty  to  which  they  advert  is  n ot  the  deserved  poverty  of 
idleness;  in  all  cases  it  is  t he  poverty  of  working  populations.  I n d e ed  the 
work  which  obtains  t he  scanty  pittance  of  food  is  for  the  m o st  part  exces 
sively  prolonged."  T he  report  brings  o ut  t he  strange,  a nd  rather  u n e x p e c t ed 
fact,  "That  of t he  divisions  of the  U n i t ed  K i n g d o m ,"  England,  Wales,  Scot 
land,  a nd  Ireland,  "the  agricultural  population  of England,"  the  richest  di 
vision,  "is  considerably

1864,  during  t he  m i l l e n n i um  of free  trade,  at  a  t i me  w h en  t he  Chancellor  of 
the  E x c h e q u er  told  t he  H o u se  of  C o m m o ns  t h at  "the  average  c o n d i t i on  of 
t he  British  labourer  h as  improved  in  a  degree  we  know  to  be  extraordinary 
a nd  u n e x a m p l ed  in  the  history  of any  country  or  any  age."  U p on  these  offi-
cial  congratulations  jars  the  dry  remark  of  the  official  Public  H e a l th  R e 
p o r t : — " T he  public  h e a l th  of  a  country  m e a ns  t he  h e a l th  of  its  masses,  a nd 
the  masses  will  scarcely  be  healthy  unless,  to  their  very  base,  they  be  at 
least  moderately  prosperous."

Dazzled  by  the  "Progress  of  t he  N a t i o n"  statistics  d a n c i ng  before  his 
eyes,  the  Chancellor  of the  Exche||6|quer  exclaims  in  wild  ecstacy:  " F r om 
1842  to  1852  the  taxable  i n c o me  of the  country  increased  by  6  per  cent.;  in 
the  eight  years  from  1853  to  1861,  it  h as  increased  from  the  basis  t a k en  in 
1853  20  per  cent!  t he  fact  is  so  astonishing  to  be  almost  incredible!  ...  This 
intoxicating  a u g m e n t a t i on  of  wealth  a nd  power,"  adds  Mr.  G l a d s t o n e,  "is 
entirely  confined  to  classes  of property!"

power  entirely  confined  to  classes  of  property"  was,  and  is  being  produced 
by  the  classes  of  labour,  look  to  the  picture  h u ng  up  in  the  last  "Public 
30  H e a l th  R e p o r t"  of  t he  workshops  of  tailors,  printers,  a nd  dressmakers! 
C o m p a re  the  "Report  of t he  Children's  E m p l o y m e nt  C o m m i s s i o n"  of  1863, 
where  it  is  stated,  for  instance,  that:  "The  potters  as  a  class,  b o th  m en  a nd 
women,  represent  a  m u ch  degenerated  population,  b o th  physically  a nd 
mentally,"  t h at  "the  u n h e a l t hy  child  is  an  u n h e a l t hy  parent  in  his  t u r n ," 
t h at  "a  progressive  deterioration  of the  race  m u st  go  on,"  a nd  t h at  "the  dé 
générescence  of the  p o p u l a t i on  of  Staffordshire  would  be  even  greater  were 
it  n ot  for  t he  constant  recruiting  from  t he  adjacent  country,  a nd  the  inter

a nd  one,  their  n u m b er  having  increased  in  t h at  single  year  from  67  to  80. 
T he  same  r e t u r ns  disclose  the  fact  that  a b o ut  3,000  persons  divide  a m o n g st 
themselves  a  yearly  i n c o me  of a b o ut  £25,000,000  sterling,  rather  m o re  t h an 
the  total  r e v e n ue  doled  o ut  annually  to  the  whole  m a ss  of  the  agricultural 
labourers  of  E n g l a nd  a nd  Wales.  O p en  the  census  of  1861,  a nd  you  will 
find  that  t he  n u m b er  of the  m a le  l a n d ed  proprietors  of E n g l a nd  a nd  Wales

credible,"  b e c a u se  E n g l a nd  h e a ds  the  E u r o pe  of c o m m e r ce  a nd  industry.  It 
will  be  r e m e m b e r ed  that  s o me  m o n t hs  ago  o ne  of t he  refugee  sons  of Louis 
Philippe  publicly  congratulated  the  English  agricultural  labourer  on  the  su- 
periority  of  his  lot  over  t h at  of his  less  florid  c o m r a de  on  the  other  side  of 
the  C h a n n e l.  I n d e e d,  with  local  colours  changed,  a nd  on  a  scale  somewhat 
contracted,  the  English  facts  reproduce  themselves  in  all  the  industrious 
a nd  progressive  countries  of the  C o n t i n e n t.  In  all  of  t h em  there  has  t a k en 
place,  since  1848,  an  unheard-of  development  of  industry,  a nd  an  u n- 
dreamed-of  e x p a n s i on  of  imports  a nd  exports.  In  all  of t h em  "the  a u g m e n 
t a t i on  of  wealth  and  power  entirely  confined  to  classes  of  property"  was 
truly  "intoxicating."  In  all  of  them,  as  in  England,  a  minority  of  the  work 
ing  classes  got  their  real  wages  somewhat  advanced;  while  in  m o st  cases  the 
m o n e t a ry  rise  of wages  denoted  no  m o re  a  real  access  of  comforts  t h an  the 
i n m a te  of the  m e t r o p o l i t an  poor-house  or  o r p h an  asylum,  for  instance,  was 
in  the  least  benefitted  by  his  first  necessaries  costing  £9  15s.  8d.  in  1861 
against  £7  7s.  4d.  in  1852.  Everywhere  t he  great  m a ss  of t he  working  classes 
were  sinking  down  to  a  lower  depth,  at  ||8|  the  s a me  rate  at  least  that  those 
above  t h em  were  rising  in  the  social  scale.  In  all  countries  of E u r o pe  it  has

t h en  as  now 

After  the  failure  of  the  revolutions  of  1848,  all  party  organisations  a nd 
party j o u r n a ls  of the  working  classes  were,  on  t he  C o n t i n e n t,  crushed  by  the 
iron  h a nd  of force,  the  m o st  advanced  sons  of l a b o ur  fled  in  despair  to  the 
Transatlantic  Republic,  a nd  the  short-lived  d r e a ms  of  e m a n c i p a t i on  van 
ished  before  an  e p o ch  of industrial  fever,  m o r al  m a r a s m,  a nd  political  reac 
tion.  T he  defeat  of  t he  c o n t i n e n t al  working  classes,  partly  owed  to  the  di 
plomacy  of  the  English  G o v e r n m e n t,  acting 
in  fraternal 
solidarity  with  the  Cabinet  of  St. Petersburg,  soon  spread  its  contagious  ef 
fects  to  this  side  of the  c h a n n e l.  While  the  r o ut  of their  c o n t i n e n t al  breth 
ren  u n m a n n ed  t he  English  working  classes,  a nd  broke  their  faith  in  their 
own  cause,  it  restored  to  the  landlord  a nd  t he  money-lord  their  somewhat 
shaken  confidence.  T h ey  insolently  withdrew  concessions  already  adver-
u s e d.  T he  discoveries  of new  goldlands  led  to  an  i m m e n se  exodus,  leaving 
an  irreparable  void  in  t he  ranks  of the  British  proletariat.  Others  of  its  for 
merly  active  m e m b e rs  were  caught  by  t he  temporary  bribe  of greater  work 
and  wages,  a nd  t u r n ed  into  "political  blacks."  All  ||9|  t he  efforts  m a de  at 
keeping  u p,  or  remodelling,  the  Chartist  M o v e m e n t,  failed  signally;  the 
press  organs  of  the  working  class  died  o ne  by  o ne  of  t he  apathy  of  the 
masses,  a n d,  in  p o i nt  of  fact,  never  before  seemed  the  English  working 
class  so  thoroughly  reconciled  to  a  state  of  political  nullity.  If,  t h e n,  there 
h ad  b e en  no  solidarity  of  action  between  the  British  a nd  the  c o n t i n e n t al 
working  classes,  there  was,  at  all  events,  a  solidarity  of  defeat.

without  its  c o m p e n s a t i ng  features.  We  shall  h e re  only  point  to  two  great 
facts. 

After  a  thirty  years'  struggle,  fought  with  m o st  admirable  perseverance, 
the  English  working  classes,  improving  a  m o m e n t a n e o us  split  between  the 
landlords  a nd  m o n ey  lords,  succeeded  in  carrying  the  T en  H o u r s'  Bill.  T he

Senior,  a nd  other  sages  of  that  stamp,  t he  m i d d le  class  h ad  predicted,  a nd 
to  their  heart's  c o n t e nt  proved,  t h at  any  legal  restriction  of  the  h o u rs  of  la 
b o ur  m u st  s o u nd  the  d e a th  knell  of  British  industry,  which,  vampyre  like, 
could  b ut  live  by  sucking  blood,  a nd  children's  blood,  too.-In  olden  times, 
child  m u r d er  was  a  mysterious  rite  of  the  religion  of  M o l o c h,  b ut  it  was 
practised  on  s o me  very  s o l e mn  occasions  only,  o n ce  a  year  perhaps,  a nd 
t h en  M o l o ch  h ad  no  exclusive  bias  for  the  children  of  t he  poor.  T h is 
struggle  a b o ut  the  legal  restriction  of  the  h o u rs  of  labour  raged  t he  m o re 
fiercely  since,  apart  from  frightened  avarice,  it  told  i n d e ed  u p on  the  great 
contest  between  the  blind  rule  of  the  supply  a nd  d e m a nd  laws  which  form 
the  political  e c o n o my  of the  m i d d le  class,  a nd  social  p r o d u c t i on  controlled 
by  ||10|  social  foresight,  which  forms  the  political  e c o n o my  of  t he  working 
class.  H e n ce  the  T en  H o u rs  Bill  was  n ot  only  a  great  practical  success;  it 
was  the  victory  of a  principle;  it  was  the  first  t i me  t h at  in  broad  daylight  the 
political  e c o n o my  of  t he  m i d d le  class  s u c c u m b ed  to  the  political  e c o n o my 
of  t he  working  class. 

But  there  was  in  store  a  still  greater  victory  of  t he  political  e c o n o my  of 
l a b o ur  over  t he  political  e c o n o my  of property.  We  speak  of the  co-operative 
m o v e m e n t,  especially  t he  co-operative  factories  raised  by  t he  unassisted  ef 
forts  of  a  few  bold  " h a n d s ."  T he  value  of  these  great  social  e x p e r i m e n ts 
c a n n ot  be  over-rated.  By  deed,  instead  of  by  argument,  they  have  shown 
that  p r o d u c t i on  on  a  large  scale,  a nd  in  accord  with  the  behests  of m o d e rn 
science,  m ay  be  carried  on  without  the  existence  of  a  class  of  masters  e m 
ploying  a  class  of h a n d s;  that  to  bear  fruit,  the  m e a ns  of l a b o ur  n e ed  n ot  be 
m o n o p o l i s ed  as  a  m e a ns  of  d o m i n i on  over,  a nd  of  extortion  against,  t he  la 
bouring  m an  himself;  a nd  that,  like  slave  labour,  like  serf labour,  hired  la 
b o ur  is  b ut  a  transitory  a nd  inferior  form,  destined  to  disappear  before  as 
sociated  l a b o ur  plying  its  toil  with  a  willing  h a n d,  a  ready  m i n d,  a nd  a 
joyous  heart.  In  England,  t he  seeds  of  the  co-operative  system  were  sown 
by  R o b e rt  Owen;  the  working  m e n 's  experiments,  tried  on  t he  c o n t i n e n t, 
were,  in  fact,  t he  practical  u p s h ot  of t he  theories,  n ot  invented,  b ut  loudly 
proclaimed,  in  1848. 

At  the  s a me  time,  the  experience  of  the  period  from  1848  to  1864,  has 
proved  b e y o nd  d o u bt  that,  however  excellent  in  principle,  a nd  however

Inaugural  Address 

useful  in  practice,  co-operative  labour,  if  kept  within  the  narrow  circle  of 
the  casual  efforts  of  private  workmen,  will  never  be  able  to  arrest  the 
growth  in  geometrical  progression  of  m o n o p o l y,  to  free  t he  masses,  n or 
even  to  perceptibly  lighten  the  b u r d en  of  their  miseries.  It  is  perhaps  for 
this  very  r e a s on  t h at  plausible  n o b l e m e n,  philanthropic  m i d d le  class  spout-
ers,  a nd  even  k e en  political  economists,  have  all  at  o n ce  t u r n ed  nauseously 
complimentary  to  the  very  co-operative  l a b o ur  system  they  h ad  vainly  tried 
to  nip  in  t he  b ud  by  deriding  it  as  the  U t o p ia  of  | | 1 1|  the  dreamer,  or  stig 
matising  it  as  t he  sacrilege  of the  socialist.  To  save  t he  industrious  masses, 
co-operative  l a b o ur  ought  to  be  developed  to  n a t i o n al  d i m e n s i o n s,  a n d, 
consequently,  to  be  fostered  by  n a t i o n al  m e a n s.  Yet,  the  lords  of  land  a nd 
the  lords  of  capital  will  always  use  their  political  privileges  for  t he  defence 
a nd  p e r p e t u a t i on  of  their  e c o n o m i c al  m o n o p o l i e s.  So  far  from  promoting, 
they  will  c o n t i n ue  to  lay  every  possible  i m p e d i m e nt  in  the  way  of  the 
e m a n c i p a t i on  of labour.  R e m e m b er  the  sneer  with  which,  last  session,  Lord 
Palmerston  p ut  down  the  advocates  of  t he  Irish  T e n a n t s'  Right  Bill.  T he 
H o u se  of C o m m o n s,  cried  he,  is  a  h o u se  of l a n d ed  proprietors.  To  c o n q u er 
political  power  has  therefore  b e c o me  the  great  duty  of  the  working  classes. 
They  s e em  to  h a ve  c o m p r e h e n d ed  this,  for  in  England,  G e r m a n y,  Italy,  a nd 
F r a n ce  there  have  taken  place  s i m u l t a n e o us  revivals,  a nd  s i m u l t a n e o us  ef 
forts  are  being  m a de  at  the  political  reorganisation  of  the  working  m e n 's 
party. 

O ne  e l e m e nt  of success  they  p o s s e s s — n u m b e r s;  b ut  n u m b e rs  weigh  only 
in  the  b a l a n c e,  if u n i t ed  by  c o m b i n a t i on  and  led  by  knowledge.  Past  expe-
rience  has  shown  how  disregard  of  that  b o nd  of  brotherhood  which  ought 
to  exist  between  the  w o r k m en  of  different  countries,  a nd  incite  t h em  to 
stand  firmly  by  e a ch  other  in  all  their  struggles  for  e m a n c i p a t i o n,  will  be 
chastised  by  t he  c o m m on  discomfiture  of  their  i n c o h e r e nt  efforts.  This 
thought  p r o m p t ed  the  working  m en  of  different  countries  assembled  on

A n o t h er  conviction  swayed  that  m e e t i n g. 
If  the  e m a n c i p a t i on  of  the  working  classes  requires  their  fraternal  con 
currence,  how  are  they  to  fulfil  that  great  m i s s i on  with  a  foreign  policy  in 
35  pursuit  of  c r i m i n al  designs,  playing  u p on  n a t i o n al  prejudices,  a nd  squan 
dering  in  piratical  wars  the  people's  blood  a nd  treasure?  It  was  n ot  the  wis 
d om  of  the  ruling  classes,  b ut  the  heroic  resistance  to  their  criminal  folly 
by  the  working  classes  of  England  t h at  saved  the  West  of  E u r o pe  from 
plunging  h e a d l o ng  into  an  infamous  crusade  for  the  perpetuation  and  prop-

international  politics;  to  watch  the  diplomatic  acts  of their  respective  Gov

T h at  the  e c o n o m i c al  subjection  of the  m an  of labour  to  the  m o n o p o l i z er

|To  Abraham  Lincoln 
President  of the  United  States 
of  America 

Sir 

We  congratulate  the  A m e r i c an  People  u p on  your  Re-election  by  a  large 
Majority. 

If resistance  to  the  Slave  Power  was  the  reserved  W a t c h w o rd  of your  first 

election,  the  t r i u m p h a nt  Warcry  of your  Re-election  is,  D e a th  to  Slavery. 

F r om  the  c o m m e n c e m e nt  of  the  Titanic  A m e r i c an  Strife,  the  Working 
m en  of  E u r o pe  felt  instinctively  that  the  Star  spangled  B a n n er  carried  the 
Destiny  of their  class.  T he  Contest  for  t he  territories  which  o p e n ed  the  dire 
epopee,  W as  it  n ot  to  decide  whether  the  virgin  soil  of  i m m e n se  tracts 
should  be  wedded  to  the  Labour  of  the  Emigrant,  or  prostituted  by  the 
T r a mp  of  t he  Slave  Driver? 

W h en  an  Oligarchy  of  300,000  Slaveholders  dared  to  inscribe,  for  the 

first  t i me  in  the  annals  of the  World,  Slavery  on  the  B a n n er  of A r m ed  R e 
volt;  when  on  the  very  spots  where  hardly  a  century  ago  t he  idea  of  one 
great  d e m o c r a t ic  R e p u b l ic  h ad  first  sprung  u p,  W h e n ce  t he  first  Declara 
tion  of  T he  Rights  of  M an  was  issued,  a nd  the  first  impulse  given  to  the 
E u r o p e an  Revolution  of  the  1 8th  Century;  W h en  on  those  very  spots  coun 
ter  revolution,  with  systematic  thoroughness,  gloried  in  rescinding  "The 
Ideas  e n t e r t a i n ed  at  the  t i me  of the  formation  of  the  old  C o n s t i t u t i o n"  and 
m a i n t a i n ed  "Slavery  to  be  a  beneficent  Institution,  i n d e ed  the  only  solu 
tion  of  the  great  p r o b l em  of  the  relation  of  L a b o ur  to  Capital",  a nd  cyni 
cally  proclaimed  property  in  M an  "The  corner  stone  of  the  n ew  Edifice"; 
T h en  the  Working  Classes  of  E u r o pe  u n d e r s t o od  at  once,  Even  before  the 
fanatic  partisanship  of  the  Upper  Classes  for  t he  confederate  gentry  h ad

President  of  the  United  States  of  America. 
Kalligraphisch  angefertigte  Adresse  mit  der  Unterschrift 
von  Marx  und  den  weiteren  Mitgliedern 
des  Provisorischen  Zentralrats  der  IAA 

To  Abraham  Lincoln,  President of the  United  States  of America 

given  its  d i s m al  warning.  T h at  the  Slaveholders'  Rebellion  was  to  sound 
the  tocsin  for  a  general  holy  Crusade  of  Property  against  Labour,  a nd  that 
for  the  M en  of  Labour,  with  their  hopes  for  t he  future,  even  their  past 
conquests  were  at  stake  in  that  t r e m e n d o us  Conflict  on  t he  other  side  of 
the  Atlantic.  Everywhere  they  bore  therefore  patiently  t he  hardships  im 
posed  u p on  t h em  by  the  Cotton  crisis,  opposed  enthusiastically  the  Pro 
Slavery  Intervention,  importunities  of  their  "betters",  a nd  from  m o st  parts 
of  E u r o pe  contributed  their  quota  of  blood  to  the  good  cause. 

While  the  Working  M e n,  the  true  political  power  of  the  N o r t h,  allowed 
Slavery  to  defile  their  own  R e p u b l i c;  while  before  the  Negro,  m a s t e r ed  a nd 
sold  without  his  concurrence,  they  boasted  it  the  highest  prerogative  of the 
white  skinned  Laborer  to  sell  himself  a nd  choose  his  own  Master;  they 
were  u n a b le  to  attain  the  true  F r e e d om  of  Labour  or  to  support  their  Euro 
pean  Brethren  in  their  struggle  for  E m a n c i p a t i o n,  b ut  this  barrier  to  prog-
ress  has  b e en  swept  off by  the  red  sea  of  Civil  War. 

T he  W o r k i ng  M en  of E u r o pe  feel  sure  that  as  the  A m e r i c an  W ar  of I n d e 
p e n d e n ce  initiated  a  new  era  of  ascendency  for  the  M i d d le  Class,  so  the 
A m e r i c an  Anti-Slavery  W ar  will  do  for  t he  Working  Classes.  T h ey  consider 
it  an  earnest  of the  epoch  to  come,  that  it  fell  to  the  lot  of Abraham  Lincoln, 
t he  single-minded  Son  of the  Working  Class,  to  lead  h is  Country  t h r o u gh  t he 

matchless  struggle  for  the  rescue  of  an  e n c h a i n ed  R a ce  a nd  t he  Recon 
struction  of  a  Social  World.

| 1|  Mr  F ox  has  rolled  up  a  rather  phantastic  picture  of the  Foreign  Policy  of 
the  F r e n ch  A n c i e nt  Regime.  According  to  his  view,  F r a n ce  allied  herself 
with  Sweden,  Poland,  a nd  Turkey  in  order  to  protect  E u r o pe  from  Russia. 
T he  t r u th  is  that  F r a n ce  contracted  those  alliances  in  the  16th  a nd  17th 
centuries,  at  a  t i me  w h en  P o l a nd  was  still  a  powerful  state  a nd  w h en  R u s- 
sia,  in  the  m o d e rn  sense  of  the  word,  did  n ot  yet  exist.  There  existed  t h en 
a  G r a nd  D u c hy  of  Muscovy,  b ut  there  existed  n ot  yet  a  R u s s i an  E m p i r e. 
It  was  therefore  n ot  against  Russia  that  F r a n ce  c o n c l u d ed  those  alliances 
with  the  Turks,  the  Magyars,  the  Poles,  a nd  the  Swedes.  She  c o n c l u d ed 
t h em  against  Austria  a nd  against  the  German  Empire,  as  a  m e a ns  of extend- 
ing  the  power,  the  influence,  a nd  the  territorial  possessions  of F r a n ce  over 
G e r m a n y,  Italy,  Spain.  I  shall  n ot  enter  u p on  details.  It  will  suffice  for  my 
purpose  to  say,  that  F r a n ce  used  those  alliances  in  the  m i d st  of  the  17th 
century  to  bring  about  the  treaty  of  Westphalia,  by  which  G e r m a ny  was  not 
only  d i s m e m b e r e d,  one  part  of  it  being  given  to  F r a n ce  a nd  t he  other  to 
Sweden,  but  every  little  G e r m an  prince  and  Baron  obtained  the  treaty  right 
to  sell  his  country  a nd  France  obtained  a  protectorate  over  G e r m a n y.  After 
the  treaty  of Westphalia,  in  the  second  part  of the  17th  century,  Louis  XIV, 
t he  t r ue  representative  of t he  old  B o u r b on  policy  at  t he  t i me  of its  strength, 
b o u g ht  the  king  of England,  Charles  II,  in  order  to  ruin  the  D u t ch  republic. 
His  system  of  vandalism  and  perfidy  t h en  carried  out  against  H o l l a n d,  Bel 
g i u m,  Spain,  G e r m a n y,  and  P i e d m o n t , — d u r i ng  about  40  years,  c a n n ot  be 
better  characterized  t h an  by  t he  one  fact,  that  in  a  memorandum,  drawn  up 
in  1837  by  t he  R u s s i an  chancellery  for  the  information  of  the  present  Czar, 
the  system  of war  a nd  diplomacy  of L. XIV  from  the  m i d d le  to  the  e nd  of  25 
t he  17  th  century  is  recommended  as  the  model  system  to  be  followed  by  R u s 
sia.

regard  to  R u s s ia  a nd  Poland,  1)  the  socalled  Polish  succession  war,  2)  The 
seven  years  war,  a nd  3)  The first  partition  of Poland.  I  shall  consider  the  atti 
t u de  t a k en  by  the  F r e n ch  G o v e r n m e nt  in  regard  to  these  events. 

1)  The  socalled  Polish  Succession  War. 

20

the  only  war  which  France  has  ever  professedly  earned  on  behalf  of Po 

After  the  d e a th  of  Augustus  II  (king  of  Poland  and  elector  of  Saxony),  in 
Sept.  1733,  o ne  party  of  the  Polish  aristocracy  wanted  to  elect  his  son  as 
king.  He  was  supported  by  Russia  a nd  Austria,  b e c a u se  he  h ad  promised  to 
the  Czarina  n ot  to  reclaim  Courland,  formerly  a  fief  of Poland,  a nd  because 
he  h ad  p r o m i s ed  to  t he  E m p e r or  t he  g u a r a n t ee  of  t he  pragmatic  sanction. 
The  other  party,  instigated  by  F r a n c e,  elected  Stanislaus  Leszczynski,  who 
had  formerly  b e en  m a de  Polish  king  by  Charles  X II  of  Sweden  a nd  who 
was  at  that  t i me  the  father-in-law  of Louis  XV.  There  broke  consequently  a 
war  out  between  F r a n ce  on  the  o ne  h a n d,  Russia  a nd  Austria  on  the  other. 
This  is 
land.  F r a n ce  m a de  war  in  G e r m a ny  a nd  Italy,  b ut  as  far  as  her  Polish  pro-
tégé  was  c o n c e r n e d,  limited  herself to  sending  1500  m en  to  D a n t z i c,  t h en  a 
Polish  town.  T he  war  having  lasted  two  years,  what  was  its  u p s h o t?  A  treaty 
of peace  (Peace  of  Vienna,  Octob.  1735),  by  w h i ch  t he  duchy  of  Lorraine,  a 
G e r m an  fief,  was  incorporated  into  France,  a nd  t he  B o u r b on  dynasty  planted 
in  Naples  a nd  Sicily,  the  same  dynasty  of  which  king  B o m ba  was  the  last 
lively  representative.  In  all  other  respects  this  "war  about  the  throne  of Po 
land"  e n d ed  in  acknowledging  the  Russian  candidate,  Augustus  III,  as  king 
of Poland,  b ut  securing  to  Louis  X V'  father-in-law  the  prerogative  of being 
called  king,  a nd  a  very  large  yearly  pension  to  be  paid  by  Poland.  This  war, 
instigated  a nd  carried  on  by  F r a n ce  u n d er  false  pretences,  e n d ed  in  the  h u-
30  miliation  of  Poland,  the  extension  of  the  R u s s i an  power,  a nd  great  disad 
vantages  to  T u r k ey  a nd  Sweden,  w h i ch  F r a n ce  h ad  also  driven  i n to  a  false 
position,  a nd  t h en  left  in  the  lurch.  But  I  shall  | | 3|  n ot  enter  u p on  these  de 
tails.

T he  c o n d u ct  of  the  F r e n ch  G o v e r n m e nt  c a n n ot  be  excused  on  the  plea 
that  the  British  G o v e r n m e nt  prevented  it  during  this  socalled  Polish  succes 
sion  war  of  acting  in  the  right  direction.  On  t he  contrary.  W h en  the  E m 
peror  Charles  VI  appealed  to  England,  the  latter  clung  to  t he  A n g l o - F r e n ch

Alliance  which  h ad  c o n t i n u ed  since  1716  a nd  was  barren  of  any  good  re 
sults  whatever.  At  all  events:  this  t i me  the  F r e n ch  G o v e r n m e n t 's  good  de 
signs  for  Poland  were  n ot  baffled  by  England. 

Before  leaving  the  subject,  I  m u st  m e n t i on  t h at  the  peace  between  Turkey 
and  Russia,  brought  a b o ut  by  F r e n ch  m e d i a t i on  (Villeneuve,  F r e n ch  a m b a s 
sador)  in  1739,  was  a  great  blow  to  Poland.  I  quote  Ruiniere:  He  says:  "it 
annulled  the 
(«cet  u n i q ue  bouclier  q ui  restait  à  la  Pologne»),  et  le  n o u v e au  traité,  signé 
à  Belgrade, 
les 
conventions  antérieures  n ' a u r a i e nt  plus  aucune force. »  | 

in  1739,  déclara  dans  son  dernier  article  « q ue

toutes 

the  Poles" 

|4|  2) The  seven Years' War.  (1756-1763.) 

I  c o me  now  to  the  7  years  war. 

Mr.  F ox  h as  told  you  t h at  that  war  was  very  u n h a p py  for  F r a n c e,  b e c a u se 
it  deprived  her,  to  the  benefit  of  England,  of most  of h er  colonies.  B ut  this 
is  n ot  the  question  before  us.  W h at  we  have  to  inquire  into  is,  what  part 
F r a n ce  played  during  that  war  in  regard  to  Poland  and  Russia. 

1 

You  m u st  know  that  from  1740  to  1748,  during  the  socalled  A u s t r i an 
succession  war,  F r a n ce  h ad  allied  herself with  Frederick  II  of Prussia  against 
Russia,  Austria,  and  England.  During  the  seven  years'  war  she  allied  herself 
with  Austria  and  Russia  against  Prussia  and  England,  so  that,  at  all  events,

T he  levity  with  which  F r a n ce  abused  h er  influence  m ay  be  s e e n — en  pas

"The  peril  was  that  Russia,  improving  the  pretext  of  the  war  against  the 
king  of  Prussia,  enforced,  on  the  territory  of  Poland,  the  passage  of  her 
troops,  appropriated  herself  the  m e a ns  of  subsistence,  and  even  took  h er 
winterquarters  in  Poland.  By  allowing  h er  to  employ  anew  those  arbitrary 
35  m e a n s,  that  vast  country  was  surrendered  to  t he  greediness  of the  Russian

2)  D u r i ng  t he  7  years  war  the  Russians  u s ed  Poland,  a l t h o u gh  she  was  os 
tensibly  n e u t r a l,  as  their  basis  of operations  against  Prussia.  T h is  t he  Poles 
allowed  under  the  diplomatic  pressure  of France.  It  was  t h us  t h at  t he  R u s s i a ns 
were  e n a b l ed  during  7  years  to  devastate  Prussia  proper,  Silesia,  P o m e r a-
nia,  B r a n d e n b o u r g,  a nd  even  sack  Berlin.  They  in  fact  ravaged  t he  Prussian 
m o n a r c hy  like  wild  beasts,  while  the  F r e n ch  acted  in  t he  s a me  style  in 
Hanover,  Westphalia,  Saxony,  Thuringia  etc.  Now,  P o l a nd  was  by  t he  treaty 
of  Wehlau  (1660  or  so)  obliged  to  defend  Prussia,  against  Russia.  Freder 
ick  II  insisted  u p on  the  fulfilment  of this  treaty.  T h at  he  was  right  in  asking 
t he  Poles  to  observe  at  least  a  complete  neutrality,  a nd  n ot  allowing  the 
R u s s i a ns  to  u se  their  country  etc,  is  proved  by  t he  fact  that  on  all  t he  diets 
kept  in  P o l a nd  since  t he  opening  of t he  seven  years'  war,  it  was  impossible 
to  c o me  to  any  resolution,  because  t he  patriotic  party  declared  the  Poles 
could  n ot  deliberate  as  long  as  R u s s i an  armies  o c c u p i ed  t he  Polish  soil,

Posen  (Great  Poland)  h ad  even  formed  a  confederation  against  t he  R u s

If  f.  i.  Belgium  allowed  Prussia  to  u se  it  during  7  years,  despite  its  neu 
trality,  as  a  basis  of warlike  operations  against  F r a n c e,  would  F r a n ce  not  be 
entitled  to  treat  Belgium  as  an  enemy,  and,  if she  could,  to  i n c o r p o r a te  Bel

3)  T he  i m m e d i a te  u p s h ot  of the  7  years'  war was  a  treaty  between  Prussia

Russia,  b ut  was  allowed,  in  c o m p e n s a t i o n,  to  share  in  t he  partition  of Po­

Berlin  wrote  to  his  court  that  Austria,  although  at  first  protesting,  would  be 
compelled  by  h er  proper  interests  to  share  in  ||7|  t he  partition  of P o l a n d. 

Mr.  Favier  says:  " O ur  exclusive  alliance  with  the  court  of  V i e n na  de 
prived  Fred. II  of  all  h o p e,  a nd  r e d u c ed  h im  to  t he  necessity  of j o i n i ng  that 
very  court  which  h ad  let  loose  F r a n ce  u p on  h i m,  in  order  to  destroy  h i m ." 
T he  same  Favier  avers  that  the  secret  of  all  the  future  successes  of  Cather 
ine  II  a nd  of  the  first  partition  of  Poland  is  to  be  found  in  the  infeodation 
to  her  of  Prussia.  (Fred.  II) 

S u ch  was  the  result  of  the  F r e n ch  policy  during  t he  7  years'  war.  It  can-
not  be  said  that  England  this  t i me  prevented  h er  good  designs  for  Poland, 
because  F r a n ce  was  t h en  the  ally  of  Russia,  while  E n g l a nd  stood  on  the 
other  side.

Now  I  m u st  say  that  even  if F r a n ce  h ad  acted  m o re  energetically  during  the 
Polish  war  which  ended  in  t he  first  partition  of Poland  t h an  she  really  did, 
it  would  n ot  have  m a de  up  for  the  i m m e n se  services  she  h ad  r e n d e r ed  to 
Russia  during  the  seven  years'  war.  T he  sending  of  s o me  F r e n ch  officers 
and  subsidies  to  Poland  during  the  war  of  the  Confederation  of  Bar  could  in 
the  best  case  only  prolong  a  useless  resistance.  It  is  true  that  F r a n ce  incited 
(1768)  Turkey  to  a war  against  Russia,  b ut  only  to  betray  Turkey  as  usually, 
and  prepare  for  her  the  "treaty  of  Kudjuk  Kainardji"  (1774),  from  which  the

Favier,  "did  it  h a p p en  that,  while  F r a n ce  was  at  peace  with  E n g l a n d,  no 
step  was  taken  for  a  convention  of  neutrality  for  the  M e d i t e r r a n e a n?  Or 
why  did  F r a n ce  alone  n ot  oppose  this  R u s s i an  entreprise  in  a  q u a r t er  so 
important  for  her  interests?"  T he  o p i n i on  of  Favier  is,  that  "the  destruction 
of  the  Russian 
been  easily  effected,  would  probably  have  changed  the  whole  course  of 
events  b o th  in  Turkey  and  Poland,  a nd  would,  moreover,  have  t a u g ht  A u s

u p on  the  war  with  Turkey)  the  duke  of Aiguillon  allowed  himself to  be  pre 
vented  by  the  Engl.  A m b a s s a d or  at  Paris,  Lord  Stormont,  from  attacking  the 
R u s s i an  fleet  in  the  Baltic  (and  M e d i t e r r a n e a n ).  At  that  t i me  the  first  parti-

m o n s t r a t i on  was  n ot  Poland,  b ut  Sweden,  a nd  F r a n ce  so  far  succeeded, 
that  Gustave  III  was  not  forced  by  Russia  to  rescind  his  coup  d'état  (1772). 

Moreover,  what  sort  of  fellow  this  d'Aiguillon  was: 

Ségur says  in  his  notes  to  Favier: 
" W h en  the  r u m o ur  got  first  afloat  as  to  t he  partition  which  was  to  give 
Prussia  an  increase  of  territory  which  Austria  was  afraid  of,  the  court  of 
V i e n na  warned  F r a n c e,  a nd  gave  her  to  u n d e r s t a nd  that  she  would  oppose 
herself,  if the  court  of Versailles  would  support  her.  L.XV,  at  that  t i me  only 
occupied  by  his  pleasures,  and  M. d'Aiguillon  by  his  intrigues,  the  A u s t r i an 
cabinet  received  no  re-assuring  answer  and  liked  better  to  c o n c ur  to  the 
partition  of  Poland  t h an  to  m a i n t a in  alone  a  war  against  the  Prussians  and 
Russians  c o m b i n e d ." 
(147,  Note)  "Count  Mercy—Austrian  a m b a s s a d o r-

At  the  end  of  1793  (September)  Prussia  again  withdrew  her  troops

Rev.  L.K.Pitt  (a  n e p h ew  od.  cousin  of the  English  minister),  chaplain  to 
the  Brit.  Factory  at  St.  Petersburg  writes  in  a  secret  document  "Account  of 
Russia  during  the  commencement  of  the  Reign  of  the  Emperor  Paul":

"She  (the  Czarina)  was  not  perhaps  displeased  to  see  every  E u r o p e an 
power  exhausting  itself  in  a  struggle,  which  raised  in  proportion  to  its  vio 
lence  her  own  i m p o r t a n ce  ...  t he  state  of  t he  newly  acquired  provinces  in

on  the  great  theatre  of war." 

T he  question  is  now:  How  behaved  revolutionary  F r a n ce  towards  this

Let  us  first  h e ar  a  F r e n ch  historian,  Lacretelle  ( t . X I I,  p . 2 61  sqq.): 
"The  Republic",  says  he  "had  shown  itself very  indifferent  to  the  troubles

Oginski  tells  us  that  w h en  the  Poles  were  informed  of  the  peace  négocia

friendly  to  Poland,  a nd  asked  for  a  clause  obliging  the  king  of Prussia  to  re

it  would  retard  the  négociations  with  Prussia,  t h at  F r a n ce  wanted  to  restore 
her  forces,  that  the  peace  with  Prussia  would  n ot  last  long,  that  t he  Poles 
should  keep  themselves  ready  for  new  efforts  which  would  be  asked  from 
t h em  in  the  cause  of liberty  a nd  their  country  etc."  T he  s a me  Oginski,  t. II, 
p. 133,  u.  223  tells  u s:  " T he  treaty  c o n c l u d ed  between  t he  F r e n ch  R e p u b l ic

the  Poles  should  be  treated  as  m e re  tools  thrown  away  after  having  b e en

three  crowns.  T h us  the  d r e a ms  of a  political  revolution  in  Poland  have  van

Pole  and  Poland,  n ot  only  from  every  public  act,  but  even  from  history".  This 
was  to  prepare  his  proposal—after  his  divorce  with  Josephine—for  the 
h a nd  of the  Czar's  sister.

to 

this  effect: 

"Art.  1  the  k i n g d om  of  Poland  shall  never-  be  re-established.  Art.  2  T he 
name  of  Poland  and  Pole  shall  never  be  applied  to  any  of  t he  parties  t h at

public  or  official  act."  Besides  "the  G r a nd  D u c hy  shall  never  be  aggran 
dized  by  the  a n n e x a t i on  of  any  of  the  old  Polish  provinces;  the  orders  of 
Polish  chivalry  shall  be  abolished;  and,  finally,  all  these  e n g a g e m e n ts  shall 
be  binding  on  t he  king  of  Saxony,  G r a nd  D u ke  of Warsaw,  as  on  N a p.  h i m 
self."  (Thiers.  Consulat  et  l'Empire.  XI)

It  was  after  the  négociations  for  that  convention  that  N a p.  proposed  for 
the  h a nd  of  A l e x a n d e r 's  sister.  N a p . 's  irritation  a nd  w o u n d ed  self  love  at 
the  hesitation  of  the  Czar  (who  delayed  declaring  himself  from  m i d d le  of 
D e c e m b er  to  m i d d le  of  January,  u n d er  various  pretexts),  a nd  the  repug 
n a n ce  of the  Czar's  m o t h e r,  m a de  N a p.  look  elsewhere  for  a  wife,  a nd  break 
off  négociations.

" T he  E m p.  N a p . ",  says  Crétineau-Joly:  Hist,  de  l'église  Romaine  en  face  de 

la  Révolution,  "did  n ot  allow  his  policy  to  lose  itself  in  a  phraseology  senti 
mentally  revolutionary.  W i th  o ne  stroke  of  the  p en  his  m i n i s t er  effaced, 
even  from  history,  t he  name  of  Poland,  a nd  a  treaty  which  s u b s e q u e nt 
events  rendered  null,  struck  out  that  n a me  as  if  it  were  a  geographical  su-
perfetation." 

After  his  marriage  with 

the  daughter  of  the  Austrian  Emperor,  N a p.  h ad  a 

new  opportunity  for  the  restauration  of  Poland.  I  quote  from  a  F r e n ch  au 
thor,  whose  history  is  an  apotheosis  of  N a p.  Norvins  says:  " N a p.  was  en- 
abled,  in  1810,  to  realize,  at  last,  that  noble  project",  viz.  t he  restauration 
of  Poland,  "because  Austria  offered  h im  b o th  the  Galicias,  b ut  he  refused, 
in  order  n ot  to  have  a  war  with  Russia  who  prepared  war  against  h im  the 
very  day  after  the  conclusion  of  the  treaty  of  Tilsit". 

25 

30 

After  what  has  preceded,  it  is  almost  superfluous  to  say  t h at  N a p.  m a de 
his  war  of  1812  against  Russia  not  o ut  of  any  regard  for  P o l a n d.  He  was 
forced  into  it  by  R u s s ia  who  on  19/31  Dec.  1810  allowed  t he  i m p o rt  of colo 
n i al  c o m m o d i t i es  in  n e u t r al  ships,  prohibited  s o me  F r e n ch  c o m m o d i t i e s, 
hardly  taxed  others,  a nd  m a de  n ot  the  least  concession  despite  all  t he  di 
p l o m a t ic  efforts  of  N a p.  at  preventing  the  war.  He  m u st  either  resign  his 
continental  system,  or  m a ke  war  against  Russia.

Sehr  geehrter  Herr! 

London,  24.  J a n u ar  1865. 

Ich  erhielt  gestern  e i n en  Brief,  worin  Sie  von  m ir  ausführliche  Beurthei-

i h n en  j e d o ch  m e i n en  g u t en  Willen  zu  zeigen,  werfe  ich  rasch  eine  kurze 
Skizze  h i n.  Sie  k ö n n en  d a nn  n a c h h o l e n,  zusetzen,  ausbessern,  kurz  u nd

P r o u d h o n 's  erster  Versuche  erinnere  ich  m i ch  n i c ht  m e h r.  Seine  Schul-  10

wagte,  zu  d e r en  Lösung  i hm  a u ch  die  ersten  V o r k e n n t n i s se  fehlten. 

Sein  erstes  W e r k:  «Qu'est  ce  que  la  Propriété?»  ist  u n b e d i n gt  sein  bestes 
Werk.  Es  ist  e p o c h e m a c h e n d,  wenn  nicht  d u r ch  n e u en  Inhalt,  so  d o ch 
d u r ch  die  n e ue  u nd  kecke  Art,  Altes  zu  sagen.  In  d en  W e r k en  der  i hm  be-  15 
k a n n t en  französischen  Socialisten  u nd  C o m m u n i s t en  war  n a t ü r l i ch  die 
..propriété"  n i c ht  n ur  mannigfach  kritisirt,  s o n d e rn  a u ch  utopistisch  „aufge 
hoben"  worden.  P r o u d h on  verhält  sich  in  j e n er  Schrift  zu  St.  S i m on  u nd 
Fourier  ungefähr  wie  sich  F e u e r b a ch  zu  Hegel  verhielt.  Verglichen  m it  H e 
gel  ist  F e u e r b a ch  d u r c h a us  arm.  D e n n o ch  war  er  e p o c h e m a c h e nd  nach  H e- 
gel,  weil  er  d en  Ton  legte  auf  gewisse,  d em  christlichen  Bewußtsein  u n a n 
g e n e h me  u nd  für  d en  Fortschritt  der  Kritik  wichtige  P u n k t e,  die  Hegel  in 
e i n em  mystischen  clair-obscur  ließ.

W e nn  ich  m i ch  so  a u s d r ü c k en  darf,  herrscht  in  j e n er  Schrift  P r o u d h o n 's 
n o ch  starke  M u s k u l a t ur  des  Styls.  U nd  ich  halte  den  Styl  derselben  für  ihr  25 
Hauptverdienst.  M an  sieht,  daß  selbst  da,  wo  n ur  Altes  reproducirt  wird, 
P r o u d h on  selbstständig  findet;  daß  das,  was  er  sagt,  i hm  selbst  n eu  war  u nd

*) «En  disant que les rapports actuels  -  les rapports de la production  bourgeoise  -  sont  natu 
rels, les économistes font entendre que ce sont là des rapports dans lesquels se crée la  richesse 
et  se  développent les  forces  productives  conformément  aux  lois  de  la nature.  Donc  ces  rap-
35  ports  sont  eux-mêmes  des  lois  naturelles  indépendantes  de  l'influence  du  temps.  Ce  sont  des 
lois  éternelles qui doivent toujours régir la société. Ainsi il y a eu de l'histoire, mais il n'y en a 
plus.»  (p. 113  meiner  Schrift.)  (Indem  die  Nationalökonomen  sagen,  daß  die  gegenwärtigen 
Verhältnisse  -  die  Verhältnisse  der bürgerlichen  Production  -  natürliche  sind,  wollen  sie  da 
mit behaupten,  daß  dies Verhältnisse  sind,  innerhalb  deren der Reichthum sich erzeugt und 
40  die Produktivkräfte sich den Gesetzen der Natur gemäß  entwickeln.  Folglich sind  diese Ver 
hältnisse  selber  Naturgesetze,  und  als  solche  unabhängig  vom  Einfluß  der  Zeit.  Es  sind  ewige 
Gesetze, welche die Gesellschaft immer beherrschen müssen.  Demnach hat es eine Geschichte 
gegeben,  aber giebt  es keine mehr.)

Vor  wenigen  J a h r en  schrieb  P r o u d h on  eine  Preisschrift  -  ich  glaube  von 
der  L a u s a n n er  Regierung  veranlaßt  -  ü b er  die  „Steuern".  H i er  erlischt  a u ch 
die  letzte  Spur  von  Genialität.  Es  bleibt  nichts  als  der  petit  bourgeois  tout 
pur. 

Was  P r o u d h o n 's  politische  u nd  philosophische  Schriften  angeht,  so  zeigt 
sich  in  allen  derselbe  widerspruchsvolle,  zwieschlächtige  Charakter,  wie  in 
d en  ö k o n o m i s c h en  Arbeiten.  D a b ei  h a b en  sie  n ur 
lokal-französischen 
W e r t h.  Seine  Angriffe  gegen  Religion,  Kirche  u.  s.  w.  besitzen  j e d o ch  ein 
großes  lokales  Verdienst  zu  einer  Zeit,  wo  die  französischen  Socialisten  es 
passend  hielten,  d em  bürgerlichen  Voltairianismus  des  18.  u nd  der  deut 
schen  Gottlosigkeit  des  19.  J a h r h u n d e r ts  d u r ch  Religiosität  überlegen  zu 
sein.  W e nn  Peter  der  G r o ße  die  russische  Barbarei  d u r ch  Barbarei  nieder 
schlug,  so  t h at  P r o u d h on  sein  Bestes,  das  französische  Phrasenwesen  durch 
die  Phrase  niederzuwerfen. 

Als  nicht  n ur  schlechte  Schriften,  sondern  als  G e m e i n h e i t e n,  j e d o ch

Das  Höchste,  was  u n t er  einer  solchen  Regierung  für  die  Arbeiter  wie  für 
die  Bourgeoisie  h e r a u s k o m m t,  ist,  daß  sie  sich  v om  K a m p fe  a u s r u h e n,  daß 
die  Industrie  sich  -  u n t er  sonst  günstigen  U m s t ä n d en  -  stark  entwickelt, 
daß  also  die  E l e m e n te  eines  n e u en  u nd  heftigeren  Kampfes  sich  ausbilden, 
u nd  daß  dieser  K a m pf ausbricht,  sobald  das  Bedürfniß  eines  solchen  R u h e

traditionelle  Stellung  am  Hof,  in  der  A r m e e,  im  B e a m t e n t h um  garantirt 
ihnen  diese  M a c h t.  Sie  dürfen  sogar  keine  besondere  Vertretung  wün

Wenn  die  Regierung  das  allgemeine  direkte  W a h l r e c ht  oktroyirte,  so 

würde  sie  es  von  vornherein  so  verklausuliren,  d aß  es  e b en  kein  allgemei

U nd  was  selbst  das  allgemeine  direkte  W a h l r e c ht  angeht,  so  braucht 
m an  n ur  n a ch  F r a n k r e i ch  zu  gehen,  um  sich  zu  ü b e r z e u g e n,  welche  zah- 
m en  W a h l en  m an  d a m it  zu  Stande  bringen  k a n n,  sobald  m an  eine  zahlrei-

gemaßregelte  Presse,  d u r ch  Polizei  h i n r e i c h e nd  niedergehaltene  Vereine, 
u nd  gar  keine  politischen  V e r s a m m l u n g en  hat.  W ie  viel  Vertreter  der  Ar-

K a m m e r?  U nd  d o ch  h at  das  französische  Proletariat  vor  d em  deutschen 
eine  weit  größere  K o n c e n t r a t i on  u nd  eine  längere  Erfahrung  im  Kampf 
u nd  in  der  Organisation  voraus. 

Dies  bringt  u ns  n o ch  auf  e i n en  a n d e rn  Punkt.  In  D e u t s c h l a nd  ist  die 
Landbevölkerung  doppelt  so  stark  wie  die  Städtebevölkerung,  d. h.  es  leben 
%  v om  Ackerbau,  %  von  der  Industrie.  U nd  da  der  große  G r u n d b e s i tz  in 
D e u t s c h l a nd  die  Regel,  u nd  der  kleine  Parzellenbauer  die  A u s n a h me  ist, 
so  heißt  das  m it  a n d e rn  W o r t e n:  daß  wenn  %  der  Arbeiter  ||49|  u n t er  d em 
K o m m a n do  des  Kapitalisten  stehn,  so  Stenn  %  unter  dem  Kommando  des 
Feudalherrn.  Die  Leute,  welche  in  e i n em  fort  ü b er  die  Kapitalisten  herfal- 
len,  aber  gegen  die  F e u d a l en  kein  W ö r t c h en  des  Zorns  h a b e n,  m ö g en  sich 
dies  zu  G e m ü t he  führen.  D i e ' F e u d a l en  b e u t en  in  D e u t s c h l a nd  doppelt  so 
viel  Arbeiter  aus  wie  die  Bourgeois;  sie  sind  in  D e u t s c h l a nd  ganz  ebenso 
direkte  G e g n er  der  Arbeiter  wie  die  Kapitalisten.  Das  ist  aber  n o ch  lange 
nicht  Alles.  D ie  patriarchalische  Wirthschaft  auf  d en  alten  F e u d a l g ü t e rn 
bringt  eine  a n g e s t a m m te  Abhängigkeit  des  l ä n d l i c h en  Tagelöhners  oder

Bourgeoisie  bei  jeder  Gelegenheit  ins  G e d ä c h t n iß  rufen,  daß  die  Klassen 
interessen  der  Arbeiter  d e n en  der  Kapitalisten  direkt  entgegengesetzt,  u nd 
daß  die  Arbeiter  sich  dessen  bewußt  sind.  Sie  wird  ihre  eigene  Organisa

Erklärung  über  die  Ursachen  des  Bruchs  mit  dem  „Social-Demokraten" 

Am  19.  November  1864  schrieb  m ir  Hr. v.  Schweitzer:  „Sollten  Sie  in  Be 
treff der  A u s g a be  des  Prospectus  n o ch  etwas  zu  b e m e r k en  h a b e n,  so  m ü ß te 
dies  umgehend  g e s c h e h e n ."  Ich  b e m e r k te  nichts.

Hr.  v.  Schweitzer  frag  ferner  an,  ob  „wir  (die  Redaction)  h i er  u nd  da 
einen  Artikel  von  I h n en  erwarten  dürfen  u nd  ob  es  u ns  zugleich  erlaubt, 
dies  unsern  Lesern  anzukündigen".  Engels  u nd  ich  verlangten  vorher  die  G e 
sellschaft  zu  k e n n e n,  worin  wir  öffentlich  figuriren  sollten.  Hr. v. Schweitzer 
zählte  sie  n un  auf,  h i n z u s c h r e i b e n d:  „ W e nn  Sie  an  e i n em  oder  d em  an 
dern  dieser  H e r r en  A n s t oß  n e h m en  sollten,  so  wird  sich  das  hoffentlich 
10  durch  die  Erwägung  erledigen,  d aß  ja  zwischen  d en  Mitarbeitern  eines 

Blattes  keine  gar  strenge  Solidarität  besteht." 

Am  28.November  schrieb  Hr.V.Schweitzer:  „Ihre  u nd  Engels'  Zusage  h at 
in  der  Partei,  so  weit  dieselbe  ü b e r h a u pt  eingeweiht  ist,  die  freudigste  Sensa 
tion  hervorgerufen."

Anfangs  Januar  1865,  n a ch  Confiscation  einer  der  ersten  N u m m e rn  des

Auf  die  N a c h r i c ht  von  Proudhon's  T od  bat  er  um  e i n en  Artikel  ü b er

sandte  i hm  Engels  die  Uebersetzung  eines  a l t d ä n i s c h en  Bauernliedes,  um 
in  einer  Randglosse  die  Nothwendigkeit  des  Kampfes  wider  das  Krautjun

Während  desselben  M o n a ts  Januar  j e d o ch  h a t te  ich  von  N e u em  gegen 
Hrn.  v.  Schweitzer's  „Taktik"  zu  protestiren.  Er  antwortete  am  4.  Februar:

Ende  Januar  veranlaßte  eine  I n s i n u a t i on  der  Pariser  Correspondenz  des

wir  freuten  u n s,  u n s e re  A n s i c ht  bestätigt  zu  finden,  daß  „das  Pariser  Prole

according  to  which  the  Paris  A d m i n i s t r a t i on  was  to  be  c o m p o s ed  as  fol 
lows:  Fribourg,  Vinçard,  L i m o u s i n,  3  m e m b e rs  to  be  designated  by  Lefort,

Subcommittee  Sitting.  6  March.  He  reproduces  that  m o t i o n. 

Sitting  of  the  Central  Council.  7  March.  He  allowed  the  a p p o i n t m e nt  of 

Schily  to  pass  without  division,  that  is  he  accepted  it,  speaking  in  a  parlia 
mentary  sense. 

After  this  h ad  t a k en  place,  he  writes  in  hot-haste  to  Paris,  even  before  he 
10  had  the  Resolutions  in  his  h a n d.  He  expected,  as  he  said  (14  M a r c h ),  t h at 

the  Paris  Administration  would  protest  against  Schily.  As  by  R e s o l u t i on  V 
[Resolution  V.  The  Administration  at  Paris  having  expressed  its  readiness  to  ac 
knowledge  a  direct  delegation  from  the  Central  Council,  the  C o u n c il  accord 
ingly  appoints  Citizen  Schily  to  be  its  delegate  to  the  said  Administration.) 
15  Schily  was  only  accredited  to  that  A d m i n i s t r a t i o n,  his  ||[2]|  a p p o i n t m e nt 

could  only  be  protested  against  by  t h e m. 

Having  failed  with  t h e m,  L u b ez  conspires  with  the  brothers  of his  lodge, 

to  declare  Schily's  a p p o i n t m e nt  the  cause  of  their  withdrawal. 

He  puts  himself  in  this  awkward  position:  He  protests  against  t he  Paris 
20  Administration  in  the  n a me  of Lefort,  a nd  he  protests  against  Schily  in  t he 
name  of  the  Paris  A d m i n i s t r a t i on  which  represents  the  F r e n ch  b r a n ch  etc. 
On  the  remark  of Mr. F ox  (last  sitting  of Central  Council)  that  h is  forget-
fulness  of  Schily's  nationality  on  4  a nd  6  M a r c h,  a nd  his  vivid  recollection 
of it  on  M a r ch  14  could  only  be  a c c o u n t ed  for  by  his  wish  to  revenge  h i m-

tions  in  order  to  hurry  t he  acceptance  of the  3  last  Resolutions,  carry  t h em 
by  surprise. 

3r d l y)  Mr.  Schily  was  no  ouvrier.  Rejected  as  principle  by  R e s o l u t i on  II. 
Schily  h ad  only  to  act  privately  with  the  Paris  a d m i n i s t r a t i o n;  Lefort  was  to 
act  u p on  the  public  stage  before  the  world  in  the  n a me  of  the  Association. 
The  cases  not  analogous. 

As  to  Lefort. 
He  asks  us  to  appoint  h im  Defender  G e n e r al  in  the  F r e n ch  Press.  We  do 
so  because  we  suppose  h im  to  act  in  u n d e r s t a n d i n g,  and  in  concurrence 
with  Tolain  etc.  This  n o m i n a t i on  so  o b t a i n ed  he  t u r ns  afterwards  against  us 
into  a  legal  title.  On  Tolain's  letter,  a nd  before  L u b ez  was  sent  to  Paris,  we 
cancel  this  a p p o i n t m e n t,  as  far  as  Mr.  Lefort's  name  a nd  public  position 
is 
concerned.  (We  r e d u ce  it  to  this:  he  is  allowed  to  write  articles  not  signed 
by  himself,  b ut  by  an  ouvrier  -  a  thing  which  he  m i g ht  have  d o ne  without 
our  consent.)  T h at  such  is  the  case,  results  from  an  angry  letter  he  t h en 
wrote  to  L u b e z,  b ut  he  yielded.  T he  Paris  m e e t i ng  of  F e b r u a ry  24th  com 
m i t t ed  only  this  b l u n d e r:  that  it  protested  against  a  resolution  that  had 
ceased  to  exist.  A nd  upon  this  Mr. Lefort,  or  his  friends  at  L o n d o n,  feign  to 
forget  that  he  h ad  already  given  up  the  post  he  was  n a m ed  ||[4]|  to.  He  even 
m e n a c es  us  to  warn  all  democrats  against  us,  forgetting  t h at  we  can  warn 
against  h i m,  if  necessary. 

He  a nd  his  m an  Lubez  say  that  he  is  n ot  m o v ed  by  personal  a m b i t i o n.  He 
only  wants  a  political  guarantee.  Well.  We  appoint  Vinçard,  a  m an  who  re 
presents  m o re  guarantees  t h an  Lefort  et  Le  L u b ez  p ut  together.  Having 
b e en  appointed,  Mr.  Vinçard  turns  into  a  n o n - e n t i ty  for  Lefort  a nd  Lubez. 
T he  only  thing  they  could  say  against  his  proposal  by  Tolain  etc,  afterwards 
confirmed  by  u s,  is  this:  that  it  was  n ot  at  the  right  t i me  c o m m u n i c a t ed  to 
Lefort.  T h us  this  miserable  point  of etiquette  is  their  last  pretence  of oppo 
sition  etc. 

International  Character  of  the  society  endangered,  a nd  Power  of  t he  Council  to 
appoint  ambassadors.

I  1)  A  general  rise  in  t he  rate  of  wages  will,  broadly  speaking,  p r o d u ce  a 
general  fall  in  the  rate  of  profits,  leaving  the  values  of  c o m m o d i t i es  u n a l 
tered. 

2)  U n d er  very  exceptional  circumstances,  only  a  general  rise  of  wages 

could  be  realised.  If obtained,  it  could  only  last  u n d er  very  exceptional  cir 
cumstances.  T he  general  tendency  of production,  u p on  its  present  basis,  is 
n ot  to  raise,  b ut  to  lower  wages.  Even  if  a  general  rise  in  the  rate  of wages 
should  obtain  for  any  longer  period,  it  would  n ot  abolish,  b ut  only  mitigate 
the  slavery  of  the  wages'  labourer,  t h at  is,  of  the  m a ss  of  t he  people. 

3) Trades'  U n i o ns  work  well  as  far  as  they  counteract,  if  even  temporar 
ily,  the  tendency  to  a  fall  in  the  general  rate  of  wages,  a nd  as  far  as  they 
t e nd  to  shorten  a nd  regulate  the  t i me  of labour,  in  other  words  the  ||  extent 
of the  working  day.  T h ey  work  well  as  far  as  they  are  a  m e a ns  of organising 
the  working  class  as  a  class.  They  fail  accidentally,  by  an  injudicious  use  of 
their  power,  a nd  they  fail  generally,  by  accepting  the  present  relations  of 
capital  and  labour  as  p e r m a n e n t,  instead  of working  for  their  abolition.  |

| 1|  Read  to  the  Central  Council  on  Tuesday, 
(20th  June  1865). 

Citizens, 

Before  entering  into  the  subject  matter,  allow  me  to  m a ke  a  few  prelimi-

5  nary  remarks. 

There  reigns  now  on  t he  C o n t i n e nt  a  real  epidemy  of  strikes  a nd  a  gen 
eral  clamour  for  a  rise  of  wages.  T he  question  will  t u rn  u p,  on  our  Con 
gress.  You,  as  t he  h e ad  of the  I n t e r n a t i o n al  Association,  ought  to  have  set 
tled  convictions  u p on 

I 
considered  it  therefore  my  duty  to  enter  fully  into  the  matter,  even  at  the 
peril  of  putting  your  patience  to  a  severe  test. 

this  p a r a m o u nt  question.  F or  my  own  part, 

10 

Another  preliminary  r e m a rk  I  have  to  m a ke  in  regard  to  citizen  W e s t o n. 
He  has  n ot  only  proposed  to  you,  b ut  publicly  defended,  in  t he  interest  of 
the  working  class,  as  he  thinks,  opinions  he  knows  to  be  m o st  u n p o p u l ar 
15  with  the  working  class.  Such  an  exhibition  of m o r al  courage,  all  of us  m u st 
highly  h o n o u r.  I  h o pe  that,  despite  the  u n v a r n i s h ed  style  of my  paper,  at  its 
conclusion  he  will  find  me  to  agree  with  what  appears  to  me  the  j u st  idea 
lying  at  t he  b o t t om  of  his  theses,  which,  however,  in  their  present  form,  I 
cannot  b ut  consider  theoretically  false  a nd  practically  dangerous. 

20 

I  shall  n ow  at  o n ce  proceed  to  the  business  before  us. 

Citizen  W e s t o n 's  a r g u m e nt  rested  in  fact  u p on  two  premises: 

1) 

7s t I y)  T h at  the  amount  of  national  production 

fixed 
quantity  or  m a g n i t u d e,  as  the  m a t h e m a t i c i a ns  would  say; 

is  a 

thing,  a  constant 

25 

2n d l y)  T h at  the  amount  of real  wages,  that  is  to  say  of  wages  as  m e a s u r ed 
by  the  quantity  of t he  c o m m o d i t i es  they  c an  buy,  is  a  fixed  a m o u n t,  a  con 
stant  m a g n i t u d e. 

143 

Karl  Marx 

Now,  his  first  assertion  is  evidently  erroneous.  Year  after  year,  you  will 
find,  that  the  value  a nd  m a ss  of  p r o d u c t i on  increase,  t h at  the  productive 
powers  of the  n a t i o n al  labour  increase,  a nd  t h at  the  a m o u nt  of m o n e y,  nec 
essary  to  circulate  this  increasing  production,  continuously  changes.  What 
is  true  at  the  end  of  the  year,  and  for  different  years  c o m p a r ed  with  each 
other,  is  true  for  every  average  day  of  the  year.  T he  a m o u nt  or  m a g n i t u de 
of national  p r o d u c t i on  changes  continuously.  It  is  not  a  constant,  but  a  va 
riable  m a g n i t u d e,  and,  apart  from  changes  in  population,  it  m u st  be  so,  be 
cause  of  the  c o n t i n u o us  change  in  the  accumulation  of  capital  a nd  the  pro 
ductive powers  of labour.  It  is  perfectly  true  that,  if  a  rise  in  the  general  rate  of 
wages  should  take  place  to-day,  t h at  rise,  whatever  its  ulterior  effects  might 
be,  would,  by  i t s e l f,  n ot  immediately  change  the  a m o u nt  of production.  It 
would,  in  the  first  instance,  proceed  from  the  existing  state  of things.  But  if 
before  the  rise  of  wages  the  n a t i o n al  p r o d u c t i on  was  variable  a nd  n ot  fixed, 
it  will  c o n t i n ue  to  be  variable,  a nd  not  fixed,  after  that  rise  of  wages. 

But  suppose  the  a m o u nt  of  n a t i o n al  p r o d u c t i on  to  be  constant  instead  of 
variable.  Even  t h en  what  o ur  friend  W e s t on  considers  a  logical  conclusion 
would  still  r e m a in  a  gratuitous  assertion.  If I  have  a  given  n u m b e r,  say  8, 
the  absolute  limits  of  this  n u m b er  do  n ot  prevent  its  parts  to  change  their 
relative  limits.  If profits  were  6  a nd  wages  2,  wages  might  increase  to  6  and 
profits  decrease  to  2,  and  still  the  total  a m o u nt  r e m a in  8.  T h us  the  fixed 
a m o u nt  of  production  would  by  no  m e a ns  prove  the  fixed  a m o u nt  of wages. 
H ow  t h en  does  our  friend  W e s t on  prove  this  fixity?  By  asserting  it. 

B ut  even  conceding  h im  his  assertion,  it  would  cut  two  sides,  while  he 
presses  it  only  in  o ne  direction.  If the  a m o u nt  of wages  is  a  constant  magni 
t u d e,  t h en  it  can  be  n e i t h er  increased,  n or  diminished.  If t h e n,  in  enforcing 
a  temporary  rise  of wages,  the  working  m en  act  foolishly,  the  capitalists,  in 
enforcing  a  temporary  fall  of wages,  would  act  n ot  less  foolishly.  O ur  friend 
W e s t on  does  n ot  deny  that,  u n d er  certain  circumstances,  t he  workingmen 
can  enforce  a  rise  of wages,  but,  their  a m o u nt  being  naturally  fixed,  there  30j 
m u st  follow  a  reaction.  On  t he  other  h a n d,  he  knows  also  t h at  the  capital- 
ists  can  enforce  a  fall  of wages,  and,  indeed,  continuously  try  to  enforce  it. 
According  to  the  principle  of  the  constancy  of  wages,  a  reaction  ought  to 
follow  in  this  case  n ot  less  t h an  in  the  former.  T he  workingmen,  therefore, 
reacting  against  the  attempt  at,  or  the  act  of,  lowering  wages,  would  act  35¡ 
rightly.  They  would,  therefore,  act  rightly  in  enforcing  a  rise  of wages,  be 
cause  every  reaction  against  the  lowering  of  wages  is  an  action  for  raising 
wages.  According  to  citizen  W e s t o n 's  own  principle  of  the  constancy  of 
wages,  the  workingmen  ought,  therefore,  u n d er  certain  circumstances,  to 
c o m b i ne  and  struggle  for  a  rise  of wages.

If he  denies  this  conclusion,  he  m u st  give  up  the  premise  from  which  it 

144 

Karl  Marx:  Value,  price  and  profit.  Seite  1 

Value,  price  and  profit 

5 

flows.  He  m u st  n ot  say  that  t he  a m o u nt  of wages  is  a  constant  quantity,  b ut 
that,  although  it  can  not  a nd  m u st  n ot  rise,  it  can  a nd  m u st fall,  whenever 
capital  pleases  to  lower  it.  If  the  capitalist  pleases  to  feed  you  u p on  pota 
toes  instead  of  u p on  meat,  and  u p on  oat  instead  of  u p on  wheat,  you  m u st 
accept  his  will  as  a  law  of  political  economy,  a nd  s u b m it  to  it.  If  in  one 
country  t he  rate  of  wages  is  higher  t h an  in  another,  in  t he  U n i t ed  St.  f.  i. 
than  in  E n g l a n d,  you  m u st  explain  this  difference  in  the  rate  of wages  by  a 
difference  b e t w e en  t he  will  of  t he  A m e r i c an  capitalist  a nd  t he  will  of  t he 
English  capitalist,  a  m e t h od  which  certainly  would  very  m u ch  simplify  n ot 

10  only  the  study  of  e c o n o m i c al  p h e n o m e n a,  b ut  of  all  other  p h e n o m e n a. 

But  even  t h e n,  we  m i g ht  ask,  why  the  will  of t he  A m e r i c an  capitalist  dif 
fers  from  t he  will  of  the  English  capitalist?  A nd  to  answer  this  question, 
you  m u st  go  beyond  t he  d o m a in  of will.  A  parson  m ay  tell  me  that  god  wills 
one  thing  in  F r a n c e,  a nd  a n o t h er  thing  in  England.  If I  s u m m on  h im  to  ex-
15  plain  me  this  duality  of will,  he  m i g ht  have  t he  brass  to  answer  me  t h at  god 
wills  to  have  o ne  will  in  F r a n ce  a nd  a n o t h er  will  in  England.  But  o ur  friend 
Weston  is  certainly  the  last  m an  to  m a ke  an  a r g u m e nt  of  such  a  complete 
negation  of  all  reasoning. 

The  will  of  the  capitalist  is  certainly  to  take  as  m u ch  as  possible.  W h at 
20  we  have  to  do,  is  n ot  to  talk  about  his  will,  but  to  inquire  into  his  power,  the 

limits  of  that  power,  a nd  t he  character  of  those  limits.  | 

|2|2) 

The  address  citizen  Weston  read  to  us,  m i g ht  have  b e en  compressed  into  a 
nutshell. 

25 

30 

All  his  reasoning  a m o u n t ed  to  this:  If t he  working  class  forces  the  capi 
talist  class  to  pay  5sh.  instead  of 4sh.  in  t he  shape  of m o n ey  wages,  the  cap 
italist  will  return,  in  the  shape  of  c o m m o d i t i e s,  4sh.  worth  instead  of  5sh. 
worth.  T he  working  class  would  have  to  pay  5sh.  for  what,  before  the  rise  of 
wages,  they  b o u g ht  with  4sh.  But  why  is  this  t he  case?  W hy  does  the  capi-
talist  only  return  4sh.  worth  for  5sh.?  Because  t he  a m o u nt  of wages  is  fixed. 
But why  is  it  fixed  at  4sh.  worth  of c o m m o d i t i e s?  W hy  n ot  at  3,  or  2,  or  any 
other  s u m?  If the  limit  of the  a m o u nt  of wages  is  settled  by  an  e c o n o m i c al 
law,  i n d e p e n d e nt  alike  of the  will  of the  capitalist  a nd  the  will  of the  work-
ingman,  the  first  thing  citizen  W e s t on  h ad  to  do,  was,  to  state  t h at  law  a nd 
35  prove  it.  He  ought  then,  moreover,  to  have  proved,  that  the  a m o u nt  of 
wages,  actually  paid  at  every  given  m o m e n t,  always  corresponds  exactly  to 
the  necessary  a m o u nt  of  wages,  and  does  never  deviate  from  it.  If,  on  t he 
other  h a n d,  the  given  limit  of the  a m o u nt  of wages,  is  founded  on  the  mere 

147 

Karl  Marx 

will  of  the  capitalist,  or  the  limits  of  his  avarice,  it  is  an  arbitrary  limit. 
There  is  n o t h i ng  necessary  in  it.  It  m ay  be  changed  by  the  will  of t he  capi 
talist,  a nd  m a y,  therefore,  be  changed  against  his  will. 

Citizen  W e s t on  illustrated  his  theory,  by  telling  you  t h at  w h en  a  bowl 
contains  a  certain  quantity  of  soup,  to  be  e a t en  by  a  certain  n u m b er  of per 
sons,  an  increase  in  the  broadness  of  t he  spoons,  would  p r o d u ce  no  in 
crease  in  the  a m o u nt  of  soup.  He  m u st  allow  me  to  find  this  illustration 
rather  spoony.  It  r e m i n d ed  me  somewhat  of the  simile  employed  by  M e n e-
nius  Agrippa.  W h en  t he  R o m an  plebeijans  struck  against  the  R o m an  patri 
cians,  the  patrician  Agrippa  told  t h e m,  that  the  patrician  belly  fed  the  ple-
beijan  m e m b e rs  of  the  body  politick.  Agrippa  failed  to  show  t h at  y ou  feed 
the  m e m b e rs  of  one  m an  by  filling  the  belly  of  an  other.  Citizen  Weston, 
on  his  part,  has  forgotten,  that  the  bowl  from  which  the  w o r k m en  eat,  is 
filled  with  the  whole  p r o d u ce  of the  n a t i o n al  labour,  a nd  that  what  prevents 
t h em  fetching  m o re  o ut  of it,  is  n e i t h er  the  narrowness  of the  bowl,  n or  the 
scantiness  of  its  contents,  b ut  only  the  smallness  of  their  spoons. 

By  what  contrivance  is  the  capitalist  enabled  to  return  4sh.  worth  for 
5sh.?  By  raising  the  price  of the  c o m m o d i ty  he  sells.  Now,  does  a  rise,  and 
m o re  generally,  a  change  in  the  prices  of  c o m m o d i t i e s,  do  the  prices  of 
c o m m o d i t i es  themselves,  depend  on  the  m e re  will  of the  capitalist?  Or  are, 
on  the  contrary,  certain  circumstances  wanted  to  give  effect  to  that  will?  If 
not,  the  ups  a nd  downs,  the  incessant  fluctuations  of  m a r k et  prices  would 
b e c o me  an  insolvable  riddle. 

As  we  suppose,  that  no  change  whatever  has  taken  place  either  in  the 
productive  powers  of  labour,  or  in  the  a m o u nt  of  capital  and  l a b o ur  em 
ployed,  or  in  the  value  of the  money,  wherein  the  values  of products  are  es 
timated,  b ut  only  a  change  in  the  rate  of wages,  how  could  that  rise  of wages 
affect  the  prices  of commodities ?  Only  by  affecting  the  actual  proportion  be 
tween  the  d e m a nd  for,  and  the  supply  of,  these  c o m m o d i t i e s. 

It  is  perfectly  true,  that  considered  as  a  whole,  the  working  class  spends,  30 

a nd  m u st  spend,  its  i n c o me  u p on  necessaries.  A  general  rise  in  the  rate  of 
wages  would  therefore  produce  a  rise  in  the  d e m a nd  a n d,  consequently,  in 
the  market  prices  of necessaries.  T he  capitalists  who  p r o d u ce  these  necessa- 
ries,  would  be  c o m p e n s a t ed  for  the  risen  wages  by  the  rising  m a r k et  prices 
of  their  c o m m o d i t i e s.  But  how  with  t he  other  capitalists  who  do  not  pro-  35 
d u ce  necessaries?  A nd  you  m u st  n ot  fancy  t h em  a  small  body.  If  you  con

Well,  what  would  be  the  position  of those  capitalists  who  do  not  p r o d u ce 
necessaries?  F or  the  fall  in  the  rate  of profit,  c o n s e q u e nt  u p on  t he  general 
rise  of wages,  they  could  n ot  c o m p e n s a te  themselves  by  a  rise  in  the prices  of 
their  commodities,  b e c a u se  the  d e m a nd  for  those  c o m m o d i t i es  would  n ot 
have  increased.  T h e ir  i n c o me  would  have  decreased,  a nd  from  this  de 
creased  i n c o me  they  would  have  to  pay  m o re  for  the  s a me  a m o u nt  of 
10  higher  priced  necessaries.  But  this  would  not  be  all.  As  their  i n c o me  h ad 
diminished,  they  would  have  less  to  spend  u p on  luxuries,  and,  therefore, 
their  m u t u al  d e m a nd  for  their  respective  c o m m o d i t i es  would  d i m i n i s h. 
Consequent  u p on  this  d i m i n i s h ed  d e m a n d,  t he  prices  of their  c o m m o d i t i es 
would  fall.  In  these  b r a n c h es  of  industry,  therefore,  the  rate  of  profit  would 
fall,  not  only  in  the  simple  proportion  to  the  general  rise  in  the  rate  of 
wages,  b ut  in  the  c o m p o u nd  ratio  of  the  general  rise  of  wages,  the  rise  in 
the  prices  of  necessaries,  a nd  the  fall  in  the  prices  of  luxuries.

W h at  would  be  the  c o n s e q u e n ce  of  this  difference  in  the  rates  of  profit  for 
capitals  employed  in  t he  different  b r a n c h es  of  industry?  Why,  the  conse-
quence  that  generally  obtains,  whenever,  from  whatever  reason,  the  average 
rate  of  profit  c o m es  to  differ  in  different  spheres  of  production.  Capital  a nd 
labour  would  be  transferred  from  the  less  remunerative  to  t he  m o re  r e m u 
nerative  branches,  a nd  this  process  of transfer  would  go  on,  until  the  supply 
in  the  o ne  d e p a r t m e nt  of  industry  would  have  risen  proportionately  to  the 
increased  d e m a n d,  a nd  would  have  sunk,  in  the  other  d e p a r t m e n t s,  accord 
ing  to  the  decreased  d e m a n d.  T h is  change  was  effected,  t he  general  rate  of 
profit  would  again  be  equalised  in  the  different  branches.  As  the  whole  de 
rangement  originally  arose  from  a  m e re  c h a n ge  in  the  proportion  of the  de 
mand  for,  a nd  t he  supply  of,  different  c o m m o d i t i e s,  the  c a u se  ceasing,  t he 
effect  would  cease,  a nd  prices  would  r e t u rn  to  their  former  level  a nd  equi 
librium.  I n s t e ad  of  being  limited  to  s o me  b r a n c h es  of  industry,  the fall  in 
the  rate  of profit,  c o n s e q u e nt  u p on  the  rise  of  wages,  would  have  b e c o me 
general.  According  to  our  supposition,  there  would  have  t a k en  place  no 
change  in  the  productive  powers  of  labour,  n or  in  the  aggregate  a m o u nt  of 

35 

production,  b ut 

that  given  amount  of production  would  have  changed  its form. 

A  greater  part  of  the  produce  would  exist  in  the  shape  of  necessaries,  a 
lesser  part  in  the  shape  of  luxuries,  or,  what  comes  to  the  same,  a  lesser 
part  would  be  exchanged  for  Foreign  luxuries,  a nd  be  c o n s u m ed  in  its  orig 
inal  form,  or,  what  again  c o m es  to  the  same,  a  greater  part  of  the  native 
40  produce  would  be  e x c h a n g ed  for  Foreign  necessaries  instead  of  for  luxu 
ries.  T he  general  rise  in  the  rate  of  wages  would,  therefore,  after  a  t e m p o-

149 

Karl  Marx 

rary  disturbance  of m a r k et  prices,  only  result  in  a  general  fall  of t he  rate  of 
profit,  without  any  p e r m a n e nt  change  in  the  prices  of  c o m m o d i t i e s. 

If I  am  told,  that  in  the  previous  a r g u m e n t,  I  a s s u me  the  whole  surplus 
wages  to  be  spent  u p on  necessaries,  I  shall  answer  t h at  I  have  m a de  the 
supposition  m o st  advantageous  to  the  o p i n i on  of  citizen  W e s t o n.  If the  sur 
plus  wages  were  spent  u p on  articles  formerly  n ot  entering  into  the  con 
s u m p t i on  of  the  workingmen,  the  real  increase  of  their  p u r c h a s i ng  power 
would  n e ed  no  proof.  Being,  however,  only  derived  from  an  advance  of 
wages,  that  increase  of  their  purchasing  power,  m u st  exactly  correspond  to 
the  decrease  of  the  purchasing  power  of  the  capitalists.  'The  aggregate  de 
mand  for  c o m m o d i t i es  would,  therefore,  n ot  increase,  b ut  the  constituent 
parts  of t h at  d e m a nd  would  change.  T he  increasing  d e m a nd  on  the  one  side 
would  be  c o u n t e r b a l a n c ed  by  the  decreasing  d e m a nd  on  t he  other  side. 
T h u s,  the  aggregate  d e m a nd  r e m a i n i ng  stationary,  no  change  whatever 
could  take  place  in  the  m a r k et  prices  of  c o m m o d i t i e s. 

Y ou  arrive,  therefore,  at  this  d i l e m m a:  Either  the  surplus  wages  are 
equally  spent  u p on  all  articles  of  c o n s u m p t i o n.  T h en  the  e x p a n s i on  of  de 
m a nd  on  the  part  of the  working  class  m u st  be  c o m p e n s a t ed  by  t he  contrac 
tion  of  d e m a nd  on  the  part  of the  capitalist  class.  Or  the  surplus  wages  are 
only  spent  u p on  s o me  articles  whose  m a r k et  prices  will  temporarily  rise. 
T h en  the  c o n s e q u e nt  rise  in  the  rate  of  profit  in  some,  a nd  the  consequent 
fall  of the  rate  of profit  in  other  branches  of industry,  will  p r o d u ce  a  change 
in  the  distribution  of  capital  and  labour,  going  on  u n t il  the  supply  is 
brought  up  to  the  increased  d e m a nd  in  the  one  d e p a r t m e nt  of  industry, 
a nd  brought  down  to  the  d i m i n i s h ed  d e m a nd  in  the  other. 

On  the  o ne  supposition,  there  will  occur  no  change  in  t he  prices  of  com 

t he  other  supposition,  after  s o me  fluctuations  of  market 
modities.  On 
prices,  the  exchangeable  values  of c o m m o d i t i es  will  subside  to  their  former 
level.  On  b o th  suppositions,  the  general  rise  in  the  rate  of  wages  will  ulti 
mately  result  in  n o t h i ng  else  b ut  a  general  fall  in  t he  rate  of  profit.  | 

| 3|  To  stir  up  y o ur  powers  of imagination,  citizen  W e s t on  requested  you 
to  think  of  the  difficulties  which  a  general  rise  of  English  agricultural 
wages  from  9  to  18sh.  would  produce.  Think,  he  exclaimed,  of the  i m m e n se 
rise  in  the  d e m a nd  for  necessaries  a nd  the  c o n s e q u e nt  fearful  rise  in  their 
prices!  Now,  all  of you  know,  that  the  average  wages  of the  A m e r i c an  agri 
cultural  labourer  a m o u nt  to  more  t h an  d o u b le  t h at  of  t he  English  agricul 
tural  labourer,  although  the  prices  of  agricultural  p r o d u ce  are  lower  in  the 
U n.  States  t h an  in  the  U n.  Kingdom,  although  the  general  relations  of capi 
tal  a nd  labour  o b t a in  in  the  U.  St.  the  s a me  as  in  England,  a nd  although 
t he  a n n u al  a m o u nt  of  production  is  m u ch  smaller  in  t he  U.  St.  t h an  in 
England.  W hy  t h en  does  our  friend  ring  this  a l a r um  bell?  Simply  to  shift 

150 

Value,  price  and  profit 

the  real  q u e s t i on  before  u s.  A  s u d d en  rise  of  wages  from  9  to  18sh.  would 
be  a  s u d d en  rise  to  t he  a m o u nt  of  100%.  N ow  we  are  n ot  at  all  discussing 
the  question  whether  t he  general  rate  of wages  in  E n g l a nd  could  suddenly 
be  increased  by  100%.  We  have  n o t h i ng  at  all  to  do  with  the  magnitude  of 
the  rise,  which  in  every  practical  instance  m u st  d e p e nd  on,  and  be  suited 
to,  given  circumstances.  We  have  only  to  e n q u i r e,  how  a  general  rise  in  the 
rate  of wages,  even  if  restricted  to  o ne  per  cent,  will  act.

Dismissing  friend  W e s t o n 's  fancy  rise  of  100 %,  I  propose  calling  your  at 
tention  to  t he  real  rise  of wages  t h at  took  place  in  G r e at  Britain  from  1849 
to  1859.

You  are  all  aware  of the  T en  H o u r 's  Bill  or  rather  T en  a nd  a  half H o u r s' 
Bill, 
introduced  since  1848.  This  was  o ne  of  the  greatest  e c o n o m i c al 
changes  we  have  witnessed.  It  was  a  s u d d en  a nd  compulsory  rise  of wages, 
not  in  some  local  trades,  but  in  the  leading  industrial  branches,  by  which 
15  England  sways  the  m a r k e ts  of  the  world.  It  was  a  rise  of wages  u n d er  cir 
cumstances  singularly  u n p r o p i t i o u s.  Dr. Ure,  Prof. Senior,  a nd  all  the  other 
official  e c o n o m i c al  m o u t h p i e c es  of the  m i d d le  class,  proved,  and  I  m u st  say 
upon  m u ch  stronger  grounds  t h an  those  of o ur  friend  W e s t o n,  that  it  would 
sound  the  d e a th  knell  of  English  industry.  They  proved,  that  it  n ot  only 
amounted  to  a  simple  rise  of wages,  b ut  to  a  rise  of wages,  initiated  by,  and 
based  u p o n,  a  d i m i n u t i on  of  the  quantity  of  labour  employed.  T h ey  as 
serted  that  t he  1 2th  h o ur  you  wanted  to  take  from  the  capitalist,  was  exactly 
the  only  h o ur  from  which  he  derived  his  profit.  They  threatened  with  a  de 
crease  of  a c c u m u l a t i o n,  rise  of  prices,  loss  of  markets,  stinting  of  p r o d u c-
tion,  c o n s e q u e nt  reaction  u p on  wages,  u l t i m a te  r u i n.  In  fact,  they  declared 
Maximilian  Robespierre's  M a x i m um  laws  to  be  a  small  affair  c o m p a r ed  to 
it,  and  they  were  right  in  a  certain  sense.  Well,  what  was  the  result?  A  rise 
in  the  m o n ey  wages  of  the  factory  operatives  despite  the  curtailing  of  the 
working  day,  a  great  increase  in  the  n u m b er  of  factory  h a n ds  employed,  a 
continuous  fall  in  the  prices  of their  products,  a  marvellous  development  in 
the  productive  powers  of their  labour,  an  u n h e a rd  of progressive  expansion 
of  the  m a r k e ts  for  their  c o m m o d i t i e s.  At  Manchester,  on  the  m e e t i n g,  in 
1861,  of  the  Society  for  t he  a d v a n c e m e nt  of  science,  I  heard  myself 
Mr.  Newman  confess,  t h at h e,  Dr.  U r e,  Senior,  and  all other official  p r o p o u n d-
ers  of e c o n o m i c al  science  h ad  b e en  wrong,  while  the  instinct  of t he  people 
had  b e en  right.  I  m e n t i on  M r . W . N e w m a n,  n ot  Professor  Francis  N e w m a n, 
because  he  occupies  an  e m i n e nt  position  in  e c o n o m i c al  science,  as  the 
contributor  to,  a nd  editor  of,  Mr.  Thomas  Tooke's:  "History  of Prices",  that 
magnificent  work  w h i ch  traces  the  history  of  prices  from  1793  to  1856.  If 
40  our friend  W e s t o n 's  fixed  ideas  of a  fixed  a m o u nt  of wages,  a  fixed  a m o u nt 
of production,  a  fixed  degree  of the  productive  power  of labour,  a  fixed  and

Karl  Marx 

p e r m a n e nt  will  of  t he  capitalists,  and  all  his  other  fixedness  a nd  finality, 
were  correct,  Prof.  Senior's  woeful  forebodings  would  have  b e en  right,  and 
R o b e rt  Owen  who,  already  in  1816,  proclaimed  a  general  limitation  of  the 
working  day  the  first  preparatory  step  to  the  e m a n c i p a t i on  of  t he  working 
class,  and,  actually,  in  the  teeth  of the  general  prejudice,  i n a u g u r a t ed  it,  on 
his  own  hook,  in  his  own  cotton  factory  at  N ew  Lanark,  would  have  been 
wrong. 

In  the  very  s a me  period,  during  which  the  I n t r o d u c t i on  of  the  Ten 
H o u r s'  Bill,  a nd  the  rise  of wages,  c o n s e q u e nt  u p on  it,  occurred,  there  took 
place  in  G r e at  Britain,  for  reasons  which  it  would  be  out  of  place  to  enu 
m e r a te  here,  a  general  rise  in  agricultural  wages. 

A l t h o u gh  it  is  n ot  required  for  my  i m m e d i a te  purpose,  in  order  to  not 

mislead  you,  I  shall  m a ke  some  preliminary  remarks. 

If  a  m an  got  2sh.  wages  weekly,  a nd  if his  wages  rose  to  4sh.,  the  rate  of 
wages  would  have  risen  by  100%.  This  would  s e em  a  very  magnificent 
thing,  if  expressed  as  a  rise  in  the  rate  of wages,  although  t he  actual  amount 
of wages,  4  shillings  weekly,  would  still  r e m a in  a  wretchedly  small,  a  starva 
tion  pittance.  Y ou  m u st  not,  therefore,  allow  yourselves  to  be  carried  away 
by  the  h i gh  sounding  per  cents  of  the  rate  of wages.  Y ou  m u st  always  ask, 
what  was  their  original  a m o u n t? 

Moreover,  you  will  u n d e r s t a n d,  that  if there  were  10  m e n,  receiving  each 
l l s h. 
2sh.  per  week,  5  m en  receiving  each  5sh.,  a nd  5  m en  receiving 
weekly,  these  20  m en  together  would  receive  lOOsh.  or  5/.weekly.  If  t h en  a 
rise,  say  by  20 %,  u p on  the  aggregate  s um  of their  weekly  wages  took  place, 
there  would  be  an  advance  from  5/.  to  6/.Taking  t he  average,  we  m i g ht  say 
that  the  general  rate  of wages  h ad  risen  by  25  %,  although  in  fact  the  wages 
of the  10  m en  h ad  r e m a i n ed  stationary,  the  wages  of  the  o ne  lot  of  5  m en 
h ad  risen  from  5  to  6sh.  o n l y,  and  the  wages  of t he  other  lot  of 5  m e n,  from 
55sh.  to  75sh.  O ne  half of t he  m en  would  n ot  have  improved  at  all  their  po 
sitions,  Y4  would  have  improved  it  in  an  inperceptible  degree,  a nd  only  % 
would  have  bettered  it  really.  Still,  reckoning  by  the  average,  t he  total 
a m o u nt  of the  wages  of those  20  m en  would  have  increased  by  25  %,  and  as 
far  as  the  aggregate  capital  that  employs  t h e m,  a nd  the  prices  of  the  com 
m o d i t i es  they  produce,  are  concerned,  it  would  be  exactly  the  s a me  as  if all 
of t h em  h ad  equally  shared  in  the  average  rise  of wages.  In  t he  case  of agri-  35 
cultural  labour,  the  standard  wages  being  very  different  in  the  different 
c o u n t i es  of E n g l a nd  a nd  Scotland,  the  rise  affected  t h em  very  unequally. 

Lastly,  during  the  period  when  that  rise  of wages  took  place,  counteract 
ing  influences  were  at  work,  such  as  the  n ew  taxes,  c o n s e q u e nt  u p on  the 
R u s s i an  war,  the  extensive  demolition  of  t he  dwelling  houses  of  the  agri-  40 
cultural  labourers,  a nd  so  forth.

Value,  price  and  profit 

Having  premissed  so  m u c h,  I  proceed  to  state  t h at  from  1849  to  1859 
there  took  place  a  rise  of about  40 %  in  the  average  rate  of  the  agricultural 
wages  of G r e at  Britain.  I  could  give  y ou  a m p le  details  in  proof of my  asser 
tion,  but,  for  the  present  purpose,  t h i nk  it  sufficient  to  refer  you  to  the  con-

5 

scientious  and  critical  paper,  read  in  1860,  by  the  late  Mt.John  C.Morton,  at 
the  L o n d on  Society  of  Arts,  on  "The  Forces  used  in  agriculture".  Mr.  M o r t on 
gives  the  returns  from  bills  a nd  other  a u t h e n t ic  d o c u m e n t s,  which  he  h ad 
collected  from  a b o ut  100  farmers  residing  in  12  Scotch  a nd  35  English 
counties. 

10 

According  to  our  friend  W e s t o n 's  opinion,  a nd  t a k en  together  with  t he 
simultaneous  rise  in  the  wages  of the  factory  operatives  there  ought  to  have 
occurred  a  t r e m e n d o us  rise  in  t he  prices  of  agricultural  p r o d u ce  d u r i ng  t he 
period  of  1 8 4 9 - 1 8 5 9.  But  what  is  the  fact?  Despite  the  R u s s i an  war,  a nd 
the  consecutive  unfavourable  harvests  from  1 8 5 4 - 1 8 5 6,  t he  average  price 
15  of  wheat,  which  is  the  leading  agricultural  produce  of  England,  fell  from 
about  31.  per  qr  for  t he  years  1838  to  1848  to  about  21.  lOsh.  per  qr  for  the 
years  1849  to  1859.  This  constitutes  a  fall  in  the  price  of  wheat  of  m o re 
than  16 %,  simultaneously  with  an  average  rise  of  agricultural  wages,  of 
40%.  D u r i ng  the  s a me  period,  if  we  c o m p a re  its  e nd  with  its  beginning, 
1859  with  1849,  there  was  a  decrease  of official  p a u p e r i sm  from  9 3 4 4 19  to 
860470,  t he  difference  b e i ng  ||4|  73  949,  a  very  small  decrease,  I  grant,  a nd 
which  in  t he  following  years  was  again  lost,  b ut  still  a  decrease. 

20 

It  m i g ht  be  said  that,  c o n s e q u e nt  u p on  the  abolition  of the  cornlaws,  the 
import  of  Foreign  corn  was  m o re  t h an  doubled  during  the  period  from 
25  1849  to  1859,  as  c o m p a r ed  to  the  period  from  1838  to  1848.  A nd  what  of 
that?  F r om  citizen  W e s t o n 's  standpoint,  one  would  have  expected  that  this 
sudden,  i m m e n s e,  a nd  continuously  increasing  d e m a nd  u p on  Foreign  m a r 
kets,  m u st  there  have  sent  up  the  prices  of agricultural  p r o d u ce  to  a  fright 
ful  height,  the  effect  of  increased  d e m a nd  remaining  the  same,  whether  it 
came  from  w i t h o ut  or  from  within.  W h at  was  t he  fact?  A p a rt  from  s o me 
years  of failing  harvests,  during  all  that  period  the  r u i n o us  fall  in  the  price 
of  corn  formed  a  standing  t h e me  of  d e c l a m a t i on  in  F r a n c e,  the  A m e r i c a ns 
were  again  a nd  again  compelled  to  b u rn  their  surplusproduce,  a nd  Russia, 
if we  were  to  believe  M r . U r q u h a r t,  p r o m p t ed  the  civil  war  in  the  U.  St.,  be-
35  cause  her  agricultural  exports  were  crippled  by  t he  Y a n k ee  c o m p e t i t i on  in 

30 

the  markets  of  Europe. 

Reduced  to 

its  abstract  form,  citizen  W e s t o n 's  a r g u m e nt  would  c o me  to 

this: 

Every  rise  of  d e m a nd  occurs  always  on  t he  basis  of  a  given  a m o u nt  of 

40  production.  It  can, 

therefore,  never  increase  the  supply  of  the  articles  de 
manded,  b ut  can  only  enhance  their  money  prices.  N ow  the  m o st  c o m m on  o b-

153

servation  shows,  that  an  increased  d e m a nd  will  in  s o me  instances  leave  the 
m a r k et  prices  of  c o m m o d i t i es  altogether  u n c h a n g ed  a nd  will  in  other  in 
stances  cause  a  temporary  rise  of  market  prices,  followed  by  an  increased 
supply,  followed  by  a  reduction  of  the  prices  to  their  original  level,  and  in 
m a ny  cases,  below  their  original  level.  W h e t h er  the  rise  of  d e m a nd  spring 
from  surplus  wages,  or  from  any  other  cause,  does  n ot  at  all  c h a n ge  the 
conditions  of  the  problem.  F r om  citizen  W e s t o n 's  s t a n d p o i nt  the  general 
p h e n o m e n on  was  as  difficult  to  explain  as  the  p h e n o m e n on  occuring  u n d er 
the  exceptional  circumstances  of  a  rise  of wages.  His  a r g u m e nt  h ad  there 
fore  no  peculiar  bearing  whatever  u p on  the  subject  we  treat.  It  only  ex 
pressed  his  perplexity  at  accounting  for  the  laws,  by  which  an  increase  of 
d e m a nd  produces  an  increase  of  supply,  instead  of  an  u l t i m a te  rise  of  mar 
ket  prices.

On  the  second  day  of the  debate,  our  friend  W e s t on  clothed  his  old  asser-  15 
tion  into  new  forms.  He  said:  C o n s e q u e nt  u p on  a  general  rise  in  money 
wages,  m o re  currency  will  be  wanted  to  pay  the  s a me  wages.  T he  currency 
being  fixed,  how  can  you  pay,  with  this  fixed  currency,  increased  m o n ey 
wages?  First  the  difficulty  arose  from  t he  fixed  a m o u nt  of  c o m m o d i t i es  ac 
cruing  to  the  workingman,  despite  his  increase  of  m o n ey  wages;  now  it  20 
arises  from  t he  increased  m o n ey  wages,  despite  the  fixed  a m o u nt  of  com 
modities.  Of  course,  if  you  reject  his  original  dogma,  his  secondary  griev 
a n ce  will  disappear. 

However,  I  shall  show,  that  this  currency  q u e s t i on  has  n o t h i ng  at  all  to 

do  with  the  subject  before  u s.

In  your  country,  t he  m e c h a n i sm  of p a y m e n ts  is  m u ch  m o re  perfectioned 
t h an  in  any  other  country  of  Europe.  T h a n ks  to  t he  extent  a nd  concentra 
t i on  of  t he  b a n k i ng  system,  m u ch  less  currency  is  wanted  to  circulate  the 
s a me  a m o u nt  of  values,  a nd  to  transact  the  s a me  or  a  greater  a m o u nt  of 
business.  F. i.,  as  far  as  wages  are  concerned,  t he  English  factory  operative,  30| 
pays  his  wages  weekly  to  t he  shopkeeper,  w ho  sends  t h em  weekly  to  the 
banker,  who  returns  t h em  weekly  to  the  manufacturer,  who  again  pays 
t h em  away  to  his  workingmen,  a nd  so  forth.  By  this  contrivance  t he  yearly 
wages  of  an  operative,  say  of  52/.,  m ay  be  paid  by  o ne  single  sovereign, 
turning  every  week  r o u nd  in  the  s a me  circle.  Even  in  E n g l a nd  this  mecha-  35| 
n i sm  is  less  perfect  t h an  in  Scotland,  a nd  is  n ot  everywhere  equally  perfect, 
and,  therefore,  we  find  f. i.,  that  in  s o me  agricultural  districts,  as  compared 
to  the  m a n u f a c t u r i ng  districts,  m u ch  m o re  currency  is  wanted  to  circulate  a 
m u ch  smaller  a m o u nt  of  values.

If  you  cross  the  Channel,  you  will  find  that  the  money  wages  are  m u ch 
lower  t h an  in  England,  b ut  t h at  they  are  circulated  in  G e r m a n y,  Italy,  Swit 
zerland  a nd  F r a n c e,  by  a  much  larger  amount  of  currency.  T he  s a me  sover 
eign  will  n ot  be  so  quickly  intercepted  by  the  banker,  or  return  to  t he  in-
dustrial  capitalist,  and,  therefore,  instead  of o ne  sovereign  circulating  521. 
yearly,  you  want  perhaps  3  sovereigns  to  circulate  yearly  wages  to  the 
a m o u nt  of  251.  T h us  by  c o m p a r i ng  c o n t i n e n t al  countries  to  England,  y ou 
will  see  at  once,  that  low  m o n ey  wages  m ay  require  a  m u ch  larger  currency 
for  their  circulation  t h an  h i gh  m o n ey  wages,  and  that  this  is  in  fact  a 

10  merely  t e c h n i c al  point,  quite  foreign  to  o ur  subject. 

According  to  the  best  calculations  I  know,  the  yearly  i n c o me  of  the 
working  class  of  this  country  m ay  be  estimated  at  250  Millions  of  I.  This 
i m m e n se  s um  is  circulated  by  a b o ut  3  Mill.  I.  Suppose  a  rise  of  wages  of 
50%  to  take  place.  T h en  instead  of  3  millions  of  currency  4½  millions 
15  would  be  wanted.  As  a  very  considerable  part  of the  workingman's  daily  ex 
penses  is  laid  out  in  silver  a nd  copper,  that  is  to  say  in  m e re  tokens,  whose 
relative  value  to  gold  is  arbitrarily  fixed  by  law,  like  t h at  of  inconvertible 
money  paper,  a  rise  of  m o n ey  wages  by  50 %,  would,  in  t he  extreme  case, 
require  an  additional  circulation  of  sovereigns,  say  to  the  a m o u nt  of  o ne 
20  million.  O ne  million,  now  d o r m a n t,  in  t he  shape  of bullion  or  coin,  in  t he 
cellars  of  t he  B a nk  of  E.,  or  of  private  b a n k e r s,  would  circulate.  B ut  e v en 
the  trifling  expense,  resulting  from  the  additional  m i n t i ng  or  the  a d d i t i o n al 
wear  a nd  tear  of  that  million,  m i g ht  be  spared,  a nd  would  actually  be 
spared,  if  any  friction  should  arise  from  the  want  of  t he  additional  cur-
rency.  All  of you  know,  that  the  currency  of this  country  is  divided  into  two 
great  d e p a r t m e n t s.  O ne  sort,  supplied  by  b a n k n o t es  of  different  descrip 
tions,  is  used  in  the  transactions  between  dealers  a nd  dealers,  a nd  t he 
larger  p a y m e n ts  from  c o n s u m e rs  to  dealers,  while  a n o t h er  sort  of  currency, 
metallic  coin,  circulates  in  the  retail  trade.  A l t h o u gh  distinct,  these  two 
sorts  of  currency  i n t e r m ix  with  e a ch  other.  T h us  gold  coin,  to  a  very  great 
extent,  circulates  even  in  larger  p a y m e n ts  for  all  the  o dd  s u ms  u n d er  5/.  If 
to-morrow  41.  notes,  or  3/.  notes,  or  21.  notes  were  issued,  the  gold  coin  fill 
ing  these  c h a n n e ls  of circulation,  would  at  once  be  driven  o ut  of t h em  a nd 
flow  into  those  channels,  where  they  would  be  n e e d ed  from  t he  increase  of 
35  money  wages.  T h us  the  additional  million  required  by  an  advance  of wages 
by  50 %,  would  be  supplied  without  the  a d d i t i on  of  o ne  single  sovereign. 
The  same  effect  might  be  produced,  without  o ne  additional  b a n k n o t e,  by 
an  additional  Bill  circulation,  as  was  t he  case  in  Lancashire  for  a  very  con 
siderable  t i m e.

If a  general  rise  in  the  rate  of wages  f.i.,  of  100 %,  as  citizen  W e s t on  s u p 
posed  it  to  take  place  in  agricultural  wages,  would  produce  a  great  rise  in 

155 

Karl  Marx 

the  prices  of necessaries,  a nd  according  to  his  views,  require  an  additional 
a m o u nt  of  currency  n ot  to  be  procured,  a  general  fall  in  wages  m u st  produce 
the  same  effect,  on  t he  same  scale,  in  an  opposite  direction.  Well!  All  of 
you  know  t h at  the  years  1858  to  1860  were  the  m o st  prosperous  years  for 
the  cotton  industry,  a nd  t h at  peculiarly  the  year  1860  stands  in  t h at  respect 
unrivalled  in  t he  annals  of  c o m m e r c e,  while  at  the  s a me  t i me  all  other 
branches  of  industry  were  most  flourishing.  T he  wages  of t he  cotton  opera 
tives,  a nd  of  all  the  other  workingmen  connected  with  their  trade,  stood  in 
1860  higher  t h an  ever  before.  T he  A m e r i c an  crisis  c a m e,  a nd  those  aggre 
gate  wages  were  suddenly  reduced  to  a b o ut  %  of their  former  a m o u n t.  This 
would  have  b e en  in  the  opposite  direction  a  rise  of  300 %.  If  wages  rise 
from  5  to  20,  we  say  t h at  they  rise  by  300 %;  if they  fall  from  20  to  5,  we  say 
that  they  fall  by  75  %,  but  the  a m o u nt  of rise  in  the  o n e,  a nd  the  a m o u nt  of 
fall  in  the  other  case  would  be  the  same,  viz.  15sh.  This  t h en  was  a  sudden 
change  in  t he  rate  of wages  unprecedented,  a nd  at  the  s a me  t i me  extending 
over  a  n u m b er  of  operatives  which,  if we  c o u nt  all  the  operatives,  not  only 
directly  engaged  in,  b ut  indirectly  d e p e n d e nt  u p o n,  the  cotton  trade,  was 
larger  by  o ne  half t h an  the  n u m b er  of  agricultural  labourers.  D id  the  price 
of wheat  fall?  It  rose  from  the  a n n u al  average  of 47sh.  8d.  per  qr  during  the 
three  years  of  1858  to  1860  to  the  a n n u al  average  of  55sh.  lOd.  per  qr.  dur 
ing  the  three  years  1 8 6 1 - 6 3.  As  to  the  currency,  there  were  coined  in  the 
m i nt  in  1861  /.8 673 232  against  /.3 3 7 8 1 02  in  1860.  ||5|  T h at  is  to  say, 
there  were  coined  /.5 295  130  m o re  in  1861  t h an  in  1860.  It  is  true,  the 
b a n k n o te  circulation  was  in  1861  by  /.  1 3 1 9 0 00  less  t h an  in  1860.  Take 
this  off.  T h e re  r e m a i ns  still  an  overplus  of  currency  for  t he  year  1861,  as 
compared  to  the  prosperity  year  1860,  to  t he  a m o u nt  of  / .3  976130,  or 
about  4  Mill.  /.,  b ut  the  bullion  reserve  in  the  B a nk  of  E n g l a nd  h ad  simul 
taneously  decreased  not  quite  in  the  same,  b ut  in  an  approaching  propor 
tion. 

C o m p a re  t he  year  1862  to  1842.  Apart  from  the  i m m e n se  increase  in  the 
value  a nd  a m o u nt  of  commodities  circulated,  in  1862  t he  capital  paid  in 
regular  terms,  for  shares,  loans,  etc,  for  the  railways  in  E n g l a nd  a nd  Wales, 
a m o u n t ed  alone  to  /.  3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0,  a  s um  that  would  have  appeared  fabulous 
in  1842.  Still  t he  aggregate  a m o u n ts  of  currency  in  1862  a nd  1842,  were 
pretty  nearly  equal,  a nd  generally  you  will  find  a  t e n d e n cy  to  a  progressive 
d i m i n u t i on  of  currency  in  the  face  of  an  e n o r m o u s ly  increasing  value  not 
only  of  c o m m o d i t i e s,  b ut  of  m o n e t a ry  transactions  generally.  F r om  our 
friend  W e s t o n 's  standpoint,  this  is  an  unsolvable  riddle. 

Looking  s o m e w h at  deeper  into  this  matter,  he  would  have  found,  that 
quite  apart  from  wages,  and  supposing  t h em  to  be  fixed,  the  value  and 
mass  of  the  c o m m o d i t i es  to  be  circulated,  a nd  generally,  t he  a m o u nt  of 

156 

Value,  price  and  profit 

monetary  t r a n s a c t i o ns  to  be  settled,  vary  daily;  t h at  the  a m o u nt  of  bank­

intervention  of  a ny  m o n e y,  by  t he  i n s t r u m e n t a l i ty  of  bills,  c h e q u e s,  b o ok 

credits,  clearing  h o u s e s,  varies  daily;  that,  as  far  as  a c t u al  metallic  currency 

5 

is  required,  the  p r o p o r t i on  between  the  coin  in  circulation  a nd  the  coin 

and  b u l l i on  in  reserve,  or  sleeping  in  t he  cellars  of  b a n ks  varies  daily;  t h at 

the  a m o u nt  of  b u l l i on  absorbed  by 

t he  n a t i o n al  circulation,  a nd 

t he 

amount  being  sent  abroad,  for  i n t e r n a t i o n al  circulation,  vary  daily.  He 

would  have  found,  t h at  his  d o g ma  of  a  fixed  currency  is  a  m o n s t r o us  error, 

10 

incompatible  with  the  every  day's  m o v e m e n t.  He  would  have  e n q u i r ed  i n to 

the  laws,  which  e n a b le  the  currency  to  a d a pt  itself to  c i r c u m s t a n c es  so  con­

tinually  changing,  instead  of  t u r n i ng  his  m i s c o n c e p t i on  of  t he  laws  of  cur­

many  different 

shapes, 

to 

its  simplest

The  u n c r i t i c al  way,  in  which  he  has  treated  his  subject,  will  b e c o me  evi-

25  dent  from  o ne  single  r e m a r k.  He  pleads  against  a  rise  of  wages  or  against 

high  wages  as  the  result  of  s u ch  a  rise.  Now,  I  ask  h i m,  what  is  h i gh  wages, 

and  what 

is 

low  wages?  W hy  constitute  f.i.  5sh.  weekly 

low,  a nd  20sh. 

weekly,  high  wages?  If  5  is  low  as  c o m p a r ed  to  20,  20  is  still  lower  as  com­

pared  to  200.  If  a  m an  was  to  lecture  on  t he  t h e r m o m e t e r,  a nd  c o m m e n c ed 

•X  by  declaiming  on  high  a nd  low  degrees,  he  would  impart  no  knowledge

how  the  boiling  p o i n t,  a nd  how  these  s t a n d a rd  points  are  settled  by  n a t u r al 

laws,  not  by  t he  fancy  of the  sellers  or  m a k e rs  of  t h e r m o m e t e r s.  N o w,  in  re­

Karl Marx 

He  will  be  u n a b le  to  tell  m e,  why  a  certain  a m o u nt  of m o n ey  is  given  for 
a  certain  a m o u nt  of  labour?  If he  should  answer  m e,  this  was  settled  by  the 
law  of  supply  a nd  d e m a n d,  I  should  ask  h i m,  in  the  first  instance,  by  what 
law  supply  a nd  d e m a nd  themselves  are  regulated?  Aye,  s u ch  an  answer 
would  at  o n ce  p ut  h im  out  of  court.  T he  relations  between  t he  supply  and 
d e m a nd  of  labour  u n d e r go  perpetual  changes,  a nd  with  t h em  the  m a r k et 
prices  of  labour.  If  t he  d e m a nd  overshoots  t he  supply,  wages  rise;  if  the 
supply  overshoots  t he  d e m a n d,  wages  sink  although  it  might,  in  s u ch  cir 
c u m s t a n c e s,  be  necessary  to  test  the  real  state  of  d e m a nd  a nd  supply  by  a 
strike  f.i.,  or  any  other  m e t h o d.  But  if you  accept  supply  a nd  d e m a nd  as  the 
law  regulating  wages,  it  would  be  as  childish  as  useless  to  d e c l a im  against  a 
rise  of wages,  because,  according  to  the  s u p r e me  law  you  appeal  to,, a  peri 
odical  rise  of wages  is  quite  as  necessary  a nd  legitimate  as  a  periodical  fall 
of  wages.  If  you  do  not  accept  supply  a nd  d e m a nd  as  t he  law  regulating 
wages,  I  again  repeat  t he  question,  why  a  certain  a m o u nt  of m o n ey  is  given 
for  a  certain  a m o u nt  of  labour? 

But  to  consider  matters  m o re  broadly:  you  would  be  altogether  mistaken 
in  fancying,  that  the  value  of labour  or  of any  other  c o m m o d i ty  whatever,  is 
ultimately  fixed  by  supply  a nd  d e m a n d.  Supply  a nd  d e m a nd  regulate  noth 
ing  but  the  temporary  fluctuations  of  m a r k et  prices.  They  will  explain  you 
why  the  m a r k et  price  of  a  c o m m o d i ty  rises  above,  or  sinks  below  its  value, 
b ut  they  can  never  a c c o u nt  for  that  value  itself.  Suppose  supply  a nd  de 
m a nd  to  equilibrate,  or  as  t he  Economists  call  it,  to  cover  e a ch  other.  Why, 
the  very  m o m e nt  these  opposite  forces  b e c o me  equal,  they  paralyse  each 
other,  and  cease  to  work  in  the  o ne  or  the  other  direction.  At  the  m o m e nt  25 
when  supply  a nd  d e m a nd  equilibrate  e a ch  other,  a nd  therefore  cease  to  act, 
the  market  price  of  a  c o m m o d i ty  coincides  with  its  real  value,  with  the 
standard  price,  r o u nd  which  its  m a r k et  prices  oscillate.  In  i n q u i r i ng  into 
the  n a t u re  of that  value,  we  have  therefore  n o t h i ng  at  all  to  do  with  the  tem 
porary  affections  of m a r k et  prices  by  supply  a nd  d e m a n d.  T he  s a me  holds  30 
true  with  wages  as  with  the  prices  of  all  other  c o m m o d i t i e s. 

R e d u c ed  to  their  simplest  theoretical  expression,  all  o ur  friend's  argu 
m e n ts  dissolve  themselves  into  this  one  single  d o g m a:  "The  prices  of  com 
modities  are  determined  or  regulated  by  wages.  " 

I  might  appeal  to  practical  observation  to  b e ar  witness  against  this  anti-  35 

q u a t ed  a nd  exploded  fallacy.  I  might  tell  you,  t h at  the  English  factory  op 
eratives,  m i n e r s,  shipbuilders  a nd  so  forth,  whose  labour  is  relatively  high-
priced,  undersell,  by  the  cheapness  of  their  p r o d u c e,  all  other  nations, 
while  the  English  agricultural  labourer  f.i.,  whose  labour  is  relatively  low-
priced,  is  u n d e r s o ld  by  almost  every  other  n a t i o n,  because  of  the  dearness  40-
of his  p r o d u c e.  By  comparing  article  with  article  in  the  s a me  country,  and 

158 

Value,  price  and  profit 

the  c o m m o d i t i es  of  different  countries,  I  m i g ht  show,  apart  from  s o me  ex 
ceptions  m o re  a p p a r e nt  t h an  real  that,  on  an  average,  the  highpriced  labour 
produces  t he  lowpriced,  a nd  the  lowpriced  l a b o ur  p r o d u c es  t he  high-priced 
commodities.  This,  of  course,  would  n ot  prove,  that  the  h i gh  price  of  la-
bour  in  the  one,  a nd  its  low  price  in  the  other  instance  are  the  respective 
causes  of  those  diametrically  opposed  effects,  b ut  at  all  events  it  would 
prove  t h at  the  prices  of  c o m m o d i t i es  are  n ot  ruled  by  the  prices  of labour. 
However,  it  is  q u i te  superfluous  for  us  to  employ  this  empirical  m e t h o d.  | 

5 

|6|  It  might,  perhaps,  be  denied  t h at  citizen  W e s t on  has  put  forward  this 
dogma:  "The  prices  of  commodities  are  determined  or  regulated  by  wages."  In 

10 

point  of fact  he  h as  never  formulated  it.  He  said  on  t he  contrary,  that  profit 
and  rent  form  also  constituent  parts  of  t he  prices  of  c o m m o d i t i e s,  because 
it  is  out  of  the  prices  of  c o m m o d i t i es  that  n ot  only  the  workingman's 
wages,  b ut  also  the  capitalist's  profits,  and  t he  landlord's  rents  m u st  be 

20 

15  paid.  But  how,  in  his  idea,  are  prices  formed?  First  by  wages.  T h en  an  addi 
tional  percentage  is  j o i n ed  to  the  price  on  behalf  of  the  capitalist,  a nd  an 
other  additional  percentage  on  behalf of t he  landlord.  Suppose  the  wages  of 
the  labour  employed  in  the  p r o d u c t i on  of a  c o m m o d i t y,  to  be  10.  If the  rate 
of profit  was  100  %  u p on  t he  wages  advanced,  t he  capitalist  would  add  ten, 
and  if the  rate  of rent  was  also  100 %  u p on  the  wages,  there  would  be  a d d ed 
10  more,  a nd  the  aggregate  price  of  the  c o m m o d i ty  would  a m o u nt  to  30. 
But  such  a  d e t e r m i n a t i on  of  prices  would  be  simply  their  d e t e r m i n a t i on  by 
wages.  If wages,  in  the  above  case,  rose  to  20,  the  price  of t he  c o m m o d i ty 
would  rise  to  60,  a nd  so  forth.  Consequently,  all  the  s u p e r a n n u a t ed  writers 
25  on  Political  E c o n o m y,  who  p r o p o u n d ed  the  d o g ma  that  wages  regulate 
prices,  have  tried  to  prove  it  by  treating  profit  a nd  rent  as  mere  additional 
percentages  upon  wages.  N o ne  of  t h em  was  of course  able  to  r e d u ce  the  lim 
its  of those  percentages  to  any  e c o n o m ic  law.  T h ey  s e em  on  the  contrary  to 
think  profits  settled  by  tradition,  custom,  the  will  of the  capitalist,  or s o me 
30  other  equally  arbitrary  a nd  inexplicable  m e t h o d.  If  they  assert,  that  they 
are  settled  by  t he  c o m p e t i t i on  between  the  capitalists,  they  say  n o t h i n g. 
That  c o m p e t i t i on  is  sure  to  equalise  the  different  rates  of profit  in  different 
trades,  or  r e d u ce  t h em  to  o ne  average  level,  b ut  it  can  never  d e t e r m i ne  t h at 
level  itself,  or  t he  general  rate  of  profit.

W h at  do  we  m e an  in  saying  that  the  prices  of  c o m m o d i t i es  are  deter 
mined  by  wages?  Wages  being  b ut  a  n a me  for  t he  price  of labour,  we  m e an 
that  the  prices  of  c o m m o d i t i es  are  regulated  by  the  price  of  labour.  As 
"price"  is  exchangeable  v a l u e - a nd  in  speaking  of  value,  I  speak  always  of 
exchangeable  value,—is  exchangeable  value  expressed  in  money,  the  propo-
sition  c o m es  to  this,  t h at  "the  value  of commodities  is  determined  by  the  value 

of  labour",  or  t h at  "the  value  of  labour  is  the  general  measure  of  value". 

159 

Karl  Marx 

But  how  t h en  is  the  "value  of labour"  itself  d e t e r m i n e d?  H e re  we  c o me  to 
a  standstill.  Of course,  to  a  standstill,  if we  try  reasoning  logically.  Yet,  the 
p r o p o u n d e rs  of t h at  doctrine  m a ke  short  work  of logical  scruples.  Take  our 
friend  W e s t on  f.i.  First  he  told  us  that  wages  regulate  the  prices  of  com 
modities,  a nd  that,  consequently,  when  wages  rise,  prices  m u st  rise.  T h en 
he  turned  r o u nd  to  show  us  that  a  rise  of  wages  will  be  no  good,  because 
the  prices  of c o m m o d i t i es  h ad  risen,  and  b e c a u se  wages  were  i n d e ed  meas 
ured  by  t he  prices  of  the  c o m m o d i t i es  u p on  which  they  are  spent.  T h us  we 
begin  by  saying  that  the  value  of  labour  d e t e r m i n es  the  value  of  c o m m o d 
ities,  and  we  wind  up  by  saying  that  the  value  of  c o m m o d i t i es  determines 
the  value  of labour.  T h us  we  move  to  and  fro  in  the  m o st  vicious  circle,  and 
arrive  at  no  conclusion  at  all. 

On  the  whole,  it  is  evident,  that  by  m a k i ng  t he  value  of o ne  commodity, 
say  labour,  corn,  or  any  other  commodity,  the  general  m e a s u re  a nd  regula 
tor  of  value,  we  only  shift  t he  difficulty,  since  we  d e t e r m i ne  o ne  value  by 
a n o t h er  value  which  on  its  side  wants  to  be  d e t e r m i n e d. 

T he  d o g ma  t h at  "wages  d e t e r m i ne  the  prices  of c o m m o d i t i e s ",  expressed 
in  its  m o st  abstract  terms,  comes  to  this,  that  "value  is  d e t e r m i n ed  by  val 
u e ",  and  this  tautology  m e a ns  that,  in  fact,  we  know  n o t h i ng  at  all  about 
value.  Accepting  this  premise,  all  reasoning  a b o ut  the  general  laws  of Polit 
ical  E c o n o my  turns  into  m e re  twaddle.  It  was,  therefore,  the  great  merit  of 
Ricardo  that,  in  his  work  "On  the  Principles  of  Pol.  Econ.",  published  in  1817, 
he  fundamentally  destroyed  the  old,  popular,  a nd  worn  out  fallacy  that 
"wages  d e t e r m i ne  prices",  a  fallacy  which  A.  S m i th  a nd  his  F r e n ch  prede 
cessors  h ad  spurned  in  the  really  scientific  parts  of  their  researches,  but 
which,  nevertheless,  they  reproduced  in  their  m o re  exoterical  and  vulgaris 
ing  chapters. 

6) 

Citizens,  I  have  now  arrived  at  a  point,  where  I  m u st  enter  u p on  t he  real 
development  of the  question.  I  c a n n ot  p r o m i se  to  do  this  in  a  very  satisfac 
tory  way,  because,  to  do  so,  I  should  be  obliged  to  walk  over  the  whole  field 
of Political  E c o n o m y.  I  can,  as  the  F r e n ch  would  say,  b ut  "effleurer  la  ques 
tion",  t o u ch  u p on  the  m a in  points. 

T he  first  question  we  have  to  p ut  is,  W h at  is  the  value  of  a  commodity? 

H ow  is  it  d e t e r m i n e d? 

On  first  sight,  it  would  seem,  that  the  value  of  a  c o m m o d i ty  is  a  thing 
quite  relative,  a nd  n ot  to  be  settled  without  considering  o ne  c o m m o d i ty  in 
its  relations  to  all  other  commodities.  In  fact,  in  speaking  of the  value,  the 

160 

Value,  price  and  profit 

value  in  e x c h a n ge  of a  c o m m o d i t y,  we  m e an  the  proportional  quantities  in 
which  it  exchanges  with  all  other  c o m m o d i t i e s.  But  t h en  arises  t he  q u e s 
tion,  how  are  the  proportions  in  which  c o m m o d i t i es  exchange  with  e a ch 
other,  regulated? 

We  know  from  experience  that  these  proportions  vary  infinitely.  Taking 
one  single  c o m m o d i t y,  wheat  f.L,  we  shall  find  t h at  a  qr  of wheat  exchanges 
in  almost  countless  variations  of  proportion  with  different  c o m m o d i t i e s. 
Yet, 
its  value  remaining  always  the  same,  whether  expressed  in  silk,  gold,  or 
any  other  c o m m o d i t y,  it  m u st  be  s o m e t h i ng  distinct  from,  a nd  i n d e p e n 
dent  of,  these  different  rates  of  exchange  with  different  articles.  It  m u st  be 
possible  to  express  it  in  a  very  different  form  these  various  e q u a t i o ns  with 
various  c o m m o d i t i e s. 

Besides:  If  I  say,  a  qr  of wheat  exchanges  with  iron  in  a  certain  propor 
tion,  or  the  value  of a  qr  of wheat  is  expressed  in  a  certain  a m o u nt  of iron,  I 
say  that  t he  value  of wheat  a nd  its  equivalent  in  iron  are  equal  to  some  third 
thing,  which  is  n e i t h er  wheat  nor  iron,  b e c a u se  I  suppose  t h em  to  express 
the  same  m a g n i t u de  in  two  different  shapes.  Either  of t h e m,  the  wheat  a nd 
the  iron,  m u st  therefore,  independently  of  the  other,  be  reducible  to  this 
third  thing  which  is  their  c o m m on  m e a s u r e. 

To  elucidate  this  point,  I  shall  recur  to  a  very  simple  geometrical  illustra 
tion.  In  c o m p a r i ng  the  areas  of  triangles  of  all  possible  forms  a nd  m a g n i 
tudes,  or  c o m p a r i ng  triangles  with  rectangles,  or  any  other  rectilinear  fig 
ure,  how  do  we  proceed?  We  reduce  the  area  of any  triangle  whatever  to  an 
expression  quite  different  from  its  visible  form.  Having  found  from  the  n a 
ture  of  the  triangle,  that  its  area  is  equal  to  half  the  p r o d u ct  of  its  base  by 
its  height,  we  can  t h en  c o m p a re  the  different  values  of all  sorts  of triangles, 
and  of  all  rectilinear  figures  whatever,  because  all  of  t h em  m ay  be  dis 
solved  into  a  certain  n u m b er  of  triangles. 

The  s a me  m o de  of  p r o c e d u re  m u st  obtain  with  the  values  of  c o m m o d 
ities.  We  m u st  be  able  to  reduce  all  of  t h em  to  an  expression  c o m m on  to 
all  and  distinguishing  t h em  only  by  the  proportions  in  w h i ch  they  c o n t a in 
that  same  a nd  identical  m e a s u r e.  | 

|7|  As  the  exchangeable  values  of  c o m m o d i t i es  are  only  social functions  of 

those  things,  a nd  have  n o t h i ng  at  all  to  do  with  their  natural  qualities,  we 
must  first  ask:  W h at  is  t he  c o m m on  social  substance  of  all  c o m m o d i t i e s?  It 
is  Labour.  To  p r o d u ce  a  c o m m o d i t y,  a  certain  a m o u nt  of  l a b o ur  m u st  be 
bestowed  u p on  it,  or  worked  up  in  it.  A nd  I  say  n ot  only  Labour,  b ut  Social 
Labour.  A  m an  who  p r o d u c es  an  article  for  his  own  i m m e d i a te  use,  to  con 
sume  it  himself,  creates  a  product,  but  n ot  a  commodity.  As  a  selfsustaining 
producer,  he  has  n o t h i ng  to  do  with  society.  But  to  p r o d u ce  a  commodity,  a 
m an  m u st  n ot  only  p r o d u ce  an  article  satisfying  s o me  social  want,  b ut  his 

161 

Karl  Marx 

labour  itself m u st  form  part  a nd  parcel  of the  total  s um  of labour,  expended 
by  society.  It  m u st  be  subordinate  to  the  Division  of Labour  within  Society.  It 
is  n o t h i ng  without  the  other  divisions  of labour,  and,  on  its  part,  is  required 
to 

integrate  t h e m. 
If  we  consider  commodities  as  values,  we  consider  t h em  exclusively  u n d er 
the  single  aspect  of  realised,  fixed,  or  if you  like,  crystallised  social  labour.  In 
this  respect  they  can  differ  only  by  representing  greater  or  smaller  quanti 
ties  of  labour,  as  f.  i.  a  greater  a m o u nt  of  labour  m ay  be  worked  up  in  a 
silken  h a n d k e r c h i ef t h an  in  a  brick.  But  how  do  we  m e a s u re  quantities  of la 
bour?  By  the  Time  the  labour  lasts,  in  m e a s u r i ng  the  l a b o ur  by  t he  hour,  the 
day  etc.  Of  course,  to  apply  this  m e a s u r e,  all  sorts  of labour  are  reduced  to 
average  or  simple  labour  as  their  unity. 

We  arrive,  therefore,  at  this  conclusion:  A  c o m m o d i ty  has  a  value,  be 
cause  it  is  a  crystallisation  of social  labour.  T he  greatness  of  its  value,  or  its 
relative  value,  d e p e n ds  u p on  the  greater  or  less  a m o u nt  of  t h at  social  sub 
stance  c o n t a i n ed  in  it;  that  is  to  say,  on  the  relative  m a ss  of  labour  neces 
sary  for  its  production.  T he  relative  values  of commodities  are,  therefore,  de 
t e r m i n ed  by  t he  respective  quantities  or  amounts  of labour,  worked  up,  realised, 
fixed  in  them.  T he  correlative  quantities  of  c o m m o d i t i e s,  which  c an  be  pro 
d u c ed  in  t he  same  time  of labour,  are  equal.  Or  the  value  of  o ne  commodity 
is  to  the  value  of an  other  c o m m o d i t y,  as  the  quantity  of labour  fixed  in  the 
one,  is  to  the  quantity  of  labour,  fixed  in  the  other. 

I  suspect  t h at  m a ny  of y ou  will  ask:  D o es  t h e n,  indeed,  there  exist  such  a 
vast  or  any  difference  whatever  between  determining  the  values  of  com 
modities  by  wages,  a nd  determining  t h em  by  t he  relative  quantities  of labour 
necessary  for  their  production?  Y ou  m u s t,  however,  be  aware  t h at  reward 
for  labour,  a nd  quantity  of  labour,  are  quite  disparate  things.  Suppose  f.i. 
equal  quantities  of labour  to  be  fixed  in  o ne  quarter  of  wheat  a nd  o ne  ounce 
of  gold.  I  resort  to  this  example  because  it  was  used  by  Benjamin  Franklin 
in  his  first  essay  published  in  1731,  a nd  entitled:  "A  modest  Inquiry  into  the 
nature  and  necessity  of a  Paper  Currency",  where  h e,  o ne  of  the  first,  hit  upon 
t he  true  n a t u re  of value.  Well!  We  suppose,  t h e n,  that  o ne  quarter  of wheat 
a nd  one  o u n ce  of gold  are  equal  values,  or  equivalents,  because  they  are  crys 
tallisations  of  equal  amounts  of average  labour,  of  so  m a ny  days',  or  so  many 
weeks'  labour,  respectively  fixed  in  t h e m.  In  t h us  d e t e r m i n i ng  t he  relative 
values  of gold  a nd  corn,  do  we  refer  in  any  way  whatever  to  the  wages  of the 
agricultural  labourer  and  the  miner?  N ot  a  bit.  We  leave  it  quite  indetermi 
nate  how  their  day's  or  their  week's  labour  was  paid,  or  even  whether  wages 
labour  was  employed  at  all.  If  it  was,  wages  m ay  have  b e en  very  unequal. 
T he  labourer  whose  labour  is  realised  in  the  quarter  of wheat,  m ay  receive 
2  bushels  only,  and  the  labourer  employed  in  mining,  m ay  receive  one  half 

162 

Value,  price  and  profit 

5 

of the  o u n ce  of gold.  Or  supposing  their  wages  to  be  equal,  they  m ay  devi 
ate  in  all  possible  proportions  from  the  values  of  the  c o m m o d i t i es  pro 
duced  by  t h e m.  They  m ay  a m o u nt  to 
l/2,  %,  %,  %,  or  any  other  proportional 
part  of t he  o ne  q u a r t er  of corn  or  t he  o ne  o u n ce  of gold.  T h e ir  wages  can,  of 
course,  n ot  exceed,  n ot  be  more  t h an  the  values  of  the  c o m m o d i t i es  they 
produced,  b ut  they  can  be  less  in  every  possible  degree.  Their  wages  will  be 
limited  by  t he  values  of  their  products,  b ut  the  values  of  their  products  will 
not  be  limited  by  their  wages.  A nd  above  all,  values,  the  relative  values  of 
corn  and  gold  f.i.,  will  have  b e en  settled  without  any  regard  whatever  to  the 
10  value  of the  labour  employed,  that  is  to  say,  to  wages.  To  d e t e r m i ne  the  val 

ues  of  c o m m o d i t i es  by  the  relative  quantities  of  labour  fixed  in  them,  is,  there 
fore,  a  thing  quite  different  from  the  tautological  m e t h od  of  d e t e r m i n i ng 
the  values  of  c o m m o d i t i es  by  the  value  of  labour,  or  by  wages.  This  point, 
however,  will  be  further  elucidated,  in  the  progress  of  our  inquiry.  |

|8|  In  calculating  t he  exchangeable  value  of  a  c o m m o d i t y,  we  m u st  add 
to  the  quantity  of  labour  last  employed,  the  quantity  of  labour  previously 
worked  up  in  the  raw  m a t e r i al  of the  c o m m o d i t y,  a nd  "the  labour  bestowed 
on  the  i m p l e m e n t s,  tools,  machinery,  a nd  buildings  with  which  s u ch  labour 
is  assisted".  F.i.  t he  value  of  a  certain  a m o u nt  of  cotton  yarn  is  t he  crystal-
lisation  of t he  quantity  of  labour  added  to  the  cotton  during  t he  spinning 
process,  t he  quantity  of  labour  previously  realised  in  t he  c o t t on  itself,  t he 
quantity  of labour  realised  in  the  coal,  oil,  a nd  other  auxiliary  m a t t er  used, 
the  quantity  of  l a b o ur  fixed  in  the  s t e am  engine,  the  spindles,  t he  factory 
building,  a nd  so  forth.  I n s t r u m e n ts  of  production,  properly  so  called,  such 
as  tools,  m a c h i n e r y,  buildings,  serve  again  a nd  again,  for  a  longer  or  short 
er  period,  during  repeated  processes  of production.  If  they  were  used  up  at 
once  like  t he  raw  material,  their  whole  value  would  at  o n ce  be  transferred 
to  the  c o m m o d i t i es  they  assist  in  producing.  But  as  a  spindle  f.i.  is  b ut 
gradually  u s ed  u p,  an  average  calculation  is  m a d e,  based  u p on  t he  average 
time  it  lasts,  and  its  average  waste  or wear  a nd  tear  during  a  certain  period, 
say  a  day.  In  this  way,  we  calculate  how  m u ch  of the  value  of the  spindle  is 
transferred  to  the  y a rn  daily  spun,  and  h ow  m u c h,  therefore,  of  t he  total 
amount  of  labour,  realised  in  a  lb  of yarn,  f.i.,  is  d ue  to  the  quantity  of  la 
bour,  previously  realised  in  the  spindle.  F or  o ur  present  purpose,  it  is  n ot 

35  necessary  to  dwell  any  longer  u p on  this  point. 

It  m i g ht  s e em  t h at  if  the  value  of  a  c o m m o d i ty  be  d e t e r m i n ed  by  the 
quantity  of labour  bestowed  upon  its production,  t he  lazier  a  m a n,  or  the  c l u m 
sier  a  m a n,  t he  m o re  valuable  his  c o m m o d i t y,  b e c a u se  t he  greater  t he  t i me 
of labour  required  for  finishing  the  c o m m o d i t y.  This,  however,  would  be  a 
sad  mistake.  Y ou  will  recollect  that  I  u s ed  t he  word  "Social  Labour",  a nd 
many  points  are  involved  in  this  qualification  of  "Social".  In  saying  that  the 

) 

163 

Karl  Marx 

value  of  a  c o m m o d i ty  is  d e t e r m i n ed  by  the  quantity  of labour  worked  up  or 
crystallised  in  it,  we  m e an  the  quantity  of labour  necessary  for  its  production 
in  a  given  state  of  society,  u n d er  certain  social  average  c o n d i t i o ns  of  pro 
duction,  with  a  given  social  average  intensity  a nd  average  skill  of  the  la 
b o ur  employed.  W h e n,  in  England,  the  powerloom  c a me  to  c o m p e te  with 
t he  h a n d l o o m,  only  half t he  former  t i me  of  labour  was  w a n t ed  to  convert  a 
given  a m o u nt  of  yarn  into  a  yard  of  cotton,  or  cloth.  T he  poor  h a n d l o om 
weaver  now  worked  17  and  18  hours  daily,  instead  of t he  9  or  10  hours  he 
h ad  worked  before.  Still  the  product  of  20  h o u rs  of  his  labour  represented 
now  only  10  social  h o u rs  of labour,  or  10  h o u rs  of l a b o ur  socially  necessary 
for  t he  conversion  of  a  certain  a m o u nt  of yarn  into  textile  stuffs.  His  prod 
u ct  of  20  h o u rs  h a d,  therefore,  no  m o re  value  t h an  his  former  product  of 
10  h o u r s. 

If,  t h e n,  t he  quantity  of  socially  necessary  labour,  realised  in  c o m m o d i 
ties,  regulates  their  exchangeable  values,  every  increase  of  t he  quantity  of 
labour  wanted  for  the  production  of  a  c o m m o d i t y,  m u st  a u g m e nt  its  value, 
as  every  d i m i n u t i on  m u st  lower  it. 

If t he  respective  quantities  of labour,  necessary  for  the  p r o d u c t i on  of the 
their  relative  values  also

respective  c o m m o d i t i e s, 
would  be  constant.  B ut  such  is  not  the  case.  T he  quantity  of labour  neces 
sary  for  t he  p r o d u c t i on  of  a  c o m m o d i ty  c h a n g es  continuously  with  the 
changes  in  the  productive  powers  of  t he  l a b o ur  employed.  T he  greater  the 
productive  powers  of  labour,  the  m o re  p r o d u ce  is  finished  in  a  given  time 
of labour,  a nd  the  smaller  the  productive  powers  of labour,  t he  less  produce 
is  finished  in  the  s a me  time.  If f.i.  in  the  progress  of population,  it  should 
b e c o me  necessary  to  cultivate  less  fertile  soils,  the  s a me  a m o u nt  of  pro 
d u ce  would  be  only  attainable  by  a  greater  a m o u nt  of l a b o ur  spent,  a nd  the 
value  of agricultural  produce  would,  consequently,  rise.  On  t he  other  hand, 
if,  with  the  m o d e rn  m e a ns  of  production,  a  single  spinner  converts  into 
yarn,  during  o ne  working  day,  m a ny  t h o u s a nd  t i m es  t he  a m o u nt  of  cotton 
which  he  could  have  s p un  during  the  s a me  t i me  with  t he  spinning  wheel,  it 
is  evident  that  every  single  p o u nd  of  cotton  will  absorb  m a ny  thousand 
times  less  of spinning  labour  t h an  it  did  before,  a n d,  consequently,  the  val 
ue  a d d ed  by  spinning  to  every  single  lb  of  cotton,  will  be  t h o u s a nd  times 
less  t h an  before.  T he  value  of  yarn  will  sink  accordingly.

T he  greater  t he  productive  powers  of  labour,  the  less  l a b o ur  is  bestowed

Having  till  n ow  only  spoken  of  Value,  I  shall  add  a  few  words  a b o ut  Price, 

which  is  a  peculiar  form  a s s u m ed  by  value. 

Price,  t a k en  by  itself,  is  n o t h i ng  b ut  t he  monetary  expression  of  value.  T he 
values  of  all  c o m m o d i t i es  of  this  country  f.i.  are  expressed  in  gold  prices, 
while,  on  t he  continent,  they  are  m a i n ly  expressed  in  silver-prices.  T he  val 
ue  of  gold  or  silver,  like  t h at  of  all  other  commodities,  is  regulated  by  the 
quantity  of  labour  necessary  for  getting 
t h e m.  Y ou  exchange  a  certain 
a m o u nt  of  your  n a t i o n al  products,  in  which  a  certain  a m o u nt  of  your  na 
tional  labour  is  crystallised,  for  the  produce  of  the  gold  a nd  silver  p r o d u c 
ing  countries,  in  which  a  certain  quantity  of  their  labour  is  crystallised.  It  is 
in  this  way,  in  fact  by  barter,  that  you  learn  to  express  in  gold  a nd  silver  the 
values  of  all  c o m m o d i t i e s,  that  is,  the  respective  quantities  of  labour  b e 
stowed  u p on  t h e m.  Looking  somewhat  closer  into  the  monetary  expression  of 
value,  or  what  c o m es  to  the  same,  t he  conversion  of value  into  price,  you  will 
find  that  it  is  a  process  by  which  you  give  to  the  values  of  all  c o m m o d i t i es 
t h em  as 
an 
quantities  of equal,  social  labour.  So  far  as  it  is  b ut  the  m o n e t a ry  expression 
of  value,  price  h as  b e en  called  natural  price  by  A.  Smith,  "prix  nécessaire"  by 
the  F r e n ch  physiocrats.

W h at  t h en  is  the  relation  between  value  and  market  prices,  or  between 

natural  prices  a nd  market  prices? 

You  all  know  that  the  market price  is  the  same  for  all  c o m m o d i t i es  of the 
same  kind,  however  the  conditions  of  p r o d u c t i on  m ay  differ  for  the  i n d i 
vidual  producers.  T he  m a r k et  prices  express  only  the  average  amount  of so 
cial  labour,  necessary  u n d er  the  average  conditions  of production,  to  supply 
the  m a r k et  with  a  certain  m a ss  of a  certain  article.  It  is  calculated  u p on  the 
whole  lot  of  a  c o m m o d i ty  of  a  certain  description. 

165 

Karl  Marx 

So  far  the  market  price  of  a  c o m m o d i ty  coincides  with  its  value.  On  the 
other  h a n d,  the  oscillations  of  m a r k et  prices,  rising  now  over,  sinking  now 
u n d er  the  value  or  n a t u r al  price,  depend  u p on  the  fluctuations  of  supply 
a nd  d e m a n d.  T he  deviations  of  m a r k et  prices  from  values  are  c o n t i n u o u s, 
b ut  as  A.Smith  says: 

5 

"The  n a t u r al  price  is  the  central  price  to  which  the  prices  of  c o m m o d i 
ties  are  continually  gravitating.  Different  accidents  m ay  s o m e t i m es  keep 
t h em  suspended  a  good  deal  above  it,  a nd  s o m e t i m es  force  t h em  down 
even  somewhat  below  it.  B ut  whatever  m ay  be  the  obstacles  w h i ch  h i n d er 
t h em  from  settling  in  this  centre  of repose  a nd  c o n t i n u a n c e,  they  are  con-  10 
stantly  tending  towards  it." 

I  c a n n ot  now  sift  this  matter.  It  suffices  to  say,  t h at  if  supply  a nd  de 
m a nd  equilibrate  each  other,  the  m a r k et  prices  of  c o m m o d i t i es  will  corre 
spond  to  their  n a t u r al  prices,  that  is  to  say  to  their  values,  as  d e t e r m i n ed  by 
t he  respective  quantities  of labour required  for  their p r o d u c t i o n.  But  supply  15 ; 
a nd  d e m a nd  must  constantly  tend  to  equilibrate  each  other,  a l t h o u gh  they 
do  so  only  by  c o m p e n s a t i ng  o ne  fluctuation  by  another,  a  rise  by  a  fall,  and 
vice  versa.  If,  instead  of  considering  only  t he  daily  fluctuations,  you  ana 
lyse  the  m o v e m e nt  of m a r k et  prices  for  longer  periods,  as  Mr.  T o o ke  f.i.  has 
d o ne  in  his  "History  of Prices",  you  will  find  t h at  the  fluctuations  of market  20  -
prices,  their  deviations  from  values,  their  u ps  and  downs,  paralyse  and 
c o m p e n s a te  each  other,  so  that,  apart  from  the  effect  of  m o n o p o l i e s,  and 
s o me  other  modifications  I  m u st  now  pass  by,  all  descriptions  of  c o m m o d i 
ties  are,  on  the  average,  sold  at  their  respective  values  or  n a t u r al  prices.  The 
average  periods  during  which  the  fluctuations  of m a r k et  prices  compensate  25 ' 
each  other,  are  different  for  different  kinds  of  c o m m o d i t i e s,  because  with 
o ne  kind  it  is  easier  to  adapt  supply  to  d e m a nd  t h an  with  t he  other. 

If  then,  speaking  broadly,  and  embracing  somewhat  longer  periods,  all 
descriptions  of c o m m o d i t i es  sell  at  their  respective  values,  it  is  n o n s e n se  to 
suppose  that  profit,  n ot  in  individual  cases,  b ut  that  the  constant  a nd  usual  307 
profits  of  different  trades,  spring  from  surcharging  the  prices  of  c o m m o d i 
ties,  or  selling  t h em  at  a  price  over  a nd  above  their  value.  T he  absurdity  of 
this  n o t i on  b e c o m es  evident,  if  it  be  generalised.  W h at  a  m an  would  con 
stantly  win  as  a  seller,  he  would  as  constantly  lose  as  a  purchaser.  It  would 
not  do  to  say,  that  there  are  m en  who  are  buyers  without  being  sellers,  or  35|| 
c o n s u m e rs  without  being  producers.  W h at  these  people  pay  to  the  produc 
ers,  they  m u st  first  get  from  t h em  for  n o t h i n g.  If  a  m an  first  takes  your 
m o n ey  and,  afterwards  returns  that  m o n ey  in  buying  your  commodities, 
y ou  will  never  enrich  yourselves,  by  selling  your  c o m m o d i t i es  too  dear  to 
that  s a me  m a n.  This  sort  of  transaction  m i g ht  d i m i n i sh  a  loss,  b ut  would  40J 
never  help  in  realising  a  profit. 

166 

Value,  price  and  profit 

To  explain,  therefore,  t he  general  nature  of  profits,  y ou  m u st  start  from  t he 

t h e o r em  t h a t,  on  an  average,  c o m m o d i t i es  are  sold  at  their  real  values,  a nd 

that  profits  are  derived from  selling  them  at  their  values,  t h at  is, 

in  p r o p o r t i on 

to  the  q u a n t i ty  of  l a b o ur  realised  in  t h e m.  If  y ou  c a n n ot  explain  profit 

5  u p on  this  supposition,  y ou  c a n n ot  explain  it  at  all.  This  seems  p a r a d ox  a nd 

contrary  to  t he  everyday's  observation.  It  is  also  p a r a d ox  t h at  t he  e a r th 

moves  r o u nd  t he  sun,  a nd  t h at  water  consists  of  two  highly  i n f l a m m a b le 

gases.  Scientific  t r u th  is  always  paradox, 

if  j u d g ed  by  everyday's  experi­

ence,  which  catches  only  t he  delusive  a p p e a r a n c es  of  things.  |

|10| 7)  (The Labouring Power.) 

Having  now,  as  far  as  it  c o u ld  be  d o ne  in  s u ch  a  cursory  m a n n e r,  analysed 

the  n a t u re  of  Value,  of  t he  Value  of  any  commodity  whatever,  we  m u st  t u rn 

our  a t t e n t i on  to  t he  specific  Value  of Labour.  A nd  h e re  again  I  m u st  startle 

you  by  a  s e e m i ng  p a r a d o x.  All  of  you  feel  sure  t h at  what  they  daily  sell,  is 

15 

their  L a b o u r;  t h a t,  therefore,  L a b o ur  h as  a  Price,  a nd  that,  t he  price  of  a 

commodity  being  only  t he  m o n e t a ry  expression  of its  value,  there  m u st  cer­

tainly  exist  s u ch  a  t h i ng  as  t he  Value  of Labour.  However,  there  exists  no 

such  thing  as  t he  Value  of Labour  in  t he  c o m m on  a c c e p t a n ce  of  t he  word. 

We  have  seen  t h at  t he  a m o u nt  of  necessary  l a b o ur  crystallised  in  a  c o m-

20  modify  constitutes  its  value.  Now,  applying  this  n o t i on  of value,  h ow  could 

we  define,  say  t he  value  of  a  10  h o u r s'  working  day?  H ow  m u ch  l a b o ur  is 

contained  in  t h at  day?  T en  h o u r s' 

labour.  To  say  t h at  t he  value  of  a 

10  h o u r s'  working  day  is  e q u al  to  10  h o u r s'  labour,  or  t he  q u a n t i ty  of  la­

bour  c o n t a i n ed  in  it,  would  be  a  tautological  a n d,  moreover,  a  n o n s e n s i c al 

25 

expression.  Of course,  having  o n ce  found  o ut  t he  true  b ut  h i d d en  sense  of 

the  expression:  ΎαΙαε  of  Labour",  we  will  be  able  to  interprete  this  irra­

tional  a nd  seemingly  impossible  application  of value,  in  t he  same  way,  t h at 

having  o n ce  m a de  sure  of t he  real  m o v e m e nt  of t he  celestial  bodies,  we  shall 

be  able  to  explain  t h e ir  a p p a r e nt  or  merely  p h e n o m e n al  m o v e m e n t s. 

30 

W h at  t he  working  m an  sells  is  n ot  directly  his  Labour,  b ut  his  Labouring 

Power,  t he  t e m p o r a ry  disposal  of which  he  m a k es  over  to  t he  capitalist.  T h is 

is  so  m u ch  t he  case  that,  I  do  n ot  know  w h e t h er  by  t he  English  Law,  b ut 

certainly  by  s o me  C o n t i n e n t al  Laws,  t he  Maximum  time  is  fixed,  for  which 

a  m an  is  allowed  to  sell  his  labouring  power.  If  allowed  to  do  so  for  any  pe-

35 

riod  whatever,  slavery  would  be  i m m e d i a t e ly  restored.  S u ch  a  sale,  if  it 

comprised  his  lifetime  f.i.,  would  m a ke  h im  at  o n ce  t he  lifelong  slave  of  his 

employer. 

One  of t he  oldest  e c o n o m i s ts  a nd  m o st  original  philosophers  of E n g l a n d, 

167 

Karl  Marx 

this 
in  his  Leviathan 
Thomas  Hobbes,  has  already 
point,  overlooked  by  all  his  successors.  He  says:  "The  value,  or  worth  of a 
man,  is,  as  in  all  other  things,  his  price:  t h at  is,  so  m u ch  as  would  be  given 
for  t he  Use  of  his  Power." 

instinctively  hit  u p on 

Proceeding  from  this  basis,  we  shall  be  able  to  d e t e r m i ne  the  value  of la 

bour,  as  t h at  of  all  other  c o m m o d i t i e s. 

But  before  doing  so,  we  might  ask,  how  does  this  strange  p h e n o m e n on 
arise,  that  we  find  on  the  m a r k et  a  set  of buyers,  possessed  of land,  machin 
ery,  raw  materials,  and  the  m e a ns  of life,  all  of t h e m,  save  l a nd  in  its  crude 
state,  the  products  of  labour,  and,  on  t he  other  h a n d,  a  set  of  sellers,  who 
have  n o t h i ng  to  sell  except  their  labouring  power,  their  working  arms  and 
brains?  T h at  t he  o ne  set  buys  continually,  in  order  to  m a ke  a  profit  and  en 
rich  themselves,  while  the  other  set  continuously  sells,  in  order  to  gain 
their  lives?  T he  inquiry  into  this  question  would  be  an  inquiry  into  what 
t he  economists  call:  The  Previous  or  Original Accumulation,  but  which  ought 
to  be  called  t he  Original  Expropriation.  We  would  find 
that  this  so-called 
Original  Accumulation  m e a ns  nothing  b ut  a  series  of  historical  processes  re 
sulting  in  a  Decomposition  of  the  Original  Union  existing  between  the  La 
bouring  M an  a nd  his  M e a ns  of  Labour.  S u ch  an  inquiry,  however,  lies  be 
yond  t he  pale  of  my  present  subject.  T he  Separation  between  t he  M an  of 
L a b o ur  a nd  t he  M e a ns  of  Labour  o n ce  established,  s u ch  a  state  of  things 
will  m a i n t a in  itself a nd  reproduce  itself u p on  a  constantly  increasing  scale, 
u n t il  a  new  a nd  fundamental  revolution  in  the  m o de  of p r o d u c t i on  should 
again  overturn  it,  and  restore  the  original  u n i on  in  a  new  historical  form. 

W h at  t h en  is  the  Value  of  the  Labouring  Power? 
Like  t h at  of every  other  commodity,  its  value  is  d e t e r m i n ed  by  the  quan 
tity  of labour  necessary  to  produce  it.  T he  labouring  power  of a  m an  exists 
only  in  his  living  individuality.  A  certain  m a ss  of necessaries  m u st  be  con 
s u m ed  by  a  m an  to  grow  up  a nd  m a i n t a in  his  life.  B ut  the  m a n,  like  the 
m a c h i n e,  will  wear  out,  a nd  m u st  be  replaced  by  a n o t h er  m a n.  Besides  the 
m a ss  of  necessaries  required  for  his  own  m a i n t e n a n c e,  he  wants  another 
a m o u nt  of necessaries  to  bring  up  a  certain  q u o ta  of  children  t h at  are  to  re 
place  h im  on  the  labour  market  a nd  to  p e r p e t u a te  the  r a ce  of  labourers. 
Moreover,  to  develop  his  labouring  power,  a nd  acquire  a  given  skill,  an 
other  a m o u nt  of  values  m u st  be  spent.  For  o ur  purpose  it  suffices  to  con 
sider  only  average  labour,  the  costs  of  whose  e d u c a t i on  a nd  development 
are  vanishing  m a g n i t u d e s.  Still,  I  m u st  seize  this  occasion  to  state  that,  as 
the  costs  of producing  labouring  powers  of  different  qualities  do  differ,  so 
m u st  differ  t he  values  of the  labouring  powers  employed  in  different  trade; 
T he  cry  for  an  equality  of wages  rests,  therefore,  u p on  a  mistake,  is  an  in 
sane  wish  never  to  be  fulfilled.  It  is  an  offspring  of that  false  a nd  superficial 

168 

Value,  price  and  profit 

radicalism  t h at  accepts  premises  a nd  tries  to  evade  conclusions.  U p on  the 
basis  of  t he  wages  system,  t he  value  of  the  labouring  power  is  settled  like 
that  of  every  other  c o m m o d i t y,  and  as  different  k i n ds  of  labouring  power 
have  different  values,  or  require  different  quantities  of labour  for  their  pro 
duction,  they  must  fetch  different  prices  in  the  labour  market. To  c l a m o ur 
for  equal  or  even  equitable  retribution  on  t he  basis  of t he  wages  system,  is  the 
same  as  to  c l a m o ur  for  freedom,  on  the  basis  of  the  slavery  system.  W h at 
you  t h i nk j u st  or  equitable,  is  out  of t he  question.  T he  question  is,  w h at  is 
necessary  a nd  u n a v o i d a b le  with  a  given  system  of  production. 

After  what  has  b e en  said,  the  value  of  the  labouring  power  is  d e t e r m i n ed 
by  the  value  of  the  necessaries  required  to  produce,  develop,  m a i n t a i n,  a nd 
perpetuate  the  labouring  power. 

8)  (Production  of Surplus  Value.) 

Now  suppose  that  the  average  a m o u nt  of  the  daily  necessaries  of  a  labour 
ing  m an  require  6  hours  of  average  labour  for  their  p r o d u c t i o n.  Suppose, 
moreover,  6  h o u rs  of  average  labour  to  be  also  realised  in  a  q u a n t i ty  of 
gold,  equal  to  3sh.  T h en  3sh.  would  be  the  Price,  or  the  m o n e t a ry  expres 
sion  of  t he  Daily  Value  of  t h at  m a n 's  Labouring  Power.  If  he  worked  daily 
6  hours,  he  would  daily  p r o d u ce  a  value  sufficient  to  buy  t he  average 
amount  of his  daily  necessaries,  or  to  m a i n t a in  himself as  a  labouring  m a n. 
But  our  m an  is  a  wages'  labourer.  He  m u s t,  therefore,  sell  his  labouring 
power  to  a  capitalist.  If he  sells  it  at  3sh.  daily,  or  18sh.  weekly,  he  sells  it  at 
its  value.  Suppose  h im  to  be  a  spinner.  If  he  works  6  h o u rs  daily,  he  will 
add  to  the  cotton  a  value  of  3sh.  daily.  This  value,  daily  a d d ed  by  h i m, 
would  be  an  exact  equivalent  for  the  wages,  or  t he  price  of  his  labouring 
power,  received  daily.  B ut  in  t h at  case  no  surplusvalue  or  surplus  produce 
whatever  would  go  to  the  capitalist.  H e r e,  then,  we  c o me  to  the  r u b. 

In  buying  the  labouring  power  of the  w o r k m an  a nd  paying  its  value,  the 
capitalist,  like  every  other  purchaser,  has  acquired  t he  right  to  c o n s u me  or 
use  the  c o m m o d i ty  bought.  You  c o n s u me  or  u se  the  labouring  power  of  a 
man,  by  m a k i ng  h im  work,  as  you  c o n s u me  or  u se  a  m a c h i ne  by  m a k i ng  it 
ran.  By  paying  the  daily  or  weekly  value  of  the  labouring  power  of  the 
workman,  t he  capitalist  h a s,  therefore,  acquired  the  right  to  u se  or  m a ke 
that  labouring  power  work  during  the  whole  day  or week.  T he  working  day  or 
the  working  week  h as  of course  certain  limits,  b ut  those  we  shall  afterwards 
look  more  closely  u p o n.  F or  the  present,  I  want  to  t u rn  your  a t t e n t i on  to 
one  decisive  point. 

The  value  of t he  labouring  power  is  d e t e r m i n ed  by  the  quantity  of labour 

169 

Karl  Marx

necessary  to  m a i n t a in  or  reproduce  it,  b ut  the  use  of  that  labouring  power 
is  only  limited  by  the  acting  energies  a nd  physical  strength  of t he  labourer. 
T he  daily  or  weekly  value  of  the  labouring  power  is  quite  distinct  from  the 
daily  ox  weekly  exercise  of  that  s a me  power,  the  s a me  as  the  food  a  horse 
wants  a nd  t he  t i me  it  can  carry  the  h o r s e m a n,  are  quite  distinct.  T he  quan- 
tity  of  labour,  by  which  the  value  of the  w o r k m a n 's  labouring  power  is  lim 
ited,  forms  by  no  m e a ns  a  limit  to  the  quantity  of l a b o ur  which  his  labour 
ing  power  is  apt  to  perform.  Take  the  e x a m p le  of our  spinner.  We  have  seen 
that,  to  | | 1 1|  daily  reproduce  his  labouring  power,  he  m u st  daily  reproduce  a 
value  of 3sh.,  which  he  will  do  by  working  6  h o u rs  daily.  But  this  does  not  10 
disable  h im  from  working  10  or  12  or  m o re  h o u rs  a  day.  B ut  by  paying  the 
daily  or  weekly  value  of  t he  spinner's  labouring  power,  the  capitalist  has 
acquired  the  right  of  using  that  labouring  power  during  the  whole  day  or 
week.  He  will,  therefore,  m a ke  h im  work  daily,  say  12  h o u r s.  Over  and  above 
the  6  hours,  required  to  replace  his  wages,  or  the  value  of  his  labouring  15 
power,  he  will,  therefore,  have  to  work  6  other  hours,  which  I  shall  call  hours 
of  surpluslabour,  which  surplus  labour  will  realise  itself  in  a  surplusvalue  and 
a  surplus  produce.  If  o ur  spinner  f.i.,  by  his  daily  labour  of  6  h o u r s,  added 
3sh.  Value  to  the  cotton,  a  value  forming  an  exact  equivalent  for  his  wages, 
he  will,  in  12  hours,  add  6sh.'s  worth  to  the  cotton,  a nd  p r o d u ce  a  propor-  20' 
tional  surplus  of yarn.  As  he  has  sold  his  labouring  power  to  the  capitalist, 
t he  whole  value  or  produce,  created  by  h i m,  belongs  to  t he  capitalist,  the 
owner  pro  tern,  of  his  labouring  power.  By  advancing  3sh.,  the  capitalist 
will,  therefore,  realise  a  value  of 6sh.,  because,  advancing  a  value,  in  which 
6  hours  of labour  are  crystallised,  he  will  receive  in  return  a  value,  in  which  25* 
12  h o u rs  of  l a b o ur  are  crystallised.  By  repeating  this  s a me  process  daily, 
t he  capitalist  will  daily  advance  3sh.  a nd  daily  pocket  6sh.,  o ne  half  of 
which  will  go  to  pay  wages  anew,  a nd  the  other  half of which  will  form  sur 
plus  value,  for  which  the  capitalist  pays  no  equivalent.  It  is  this  sort  of ex 
change  between  capital  and  labour,  u p on  which  capitalistic  p r o d u c t i o n,  or  the 
wages  system,  is  founded,  a nd  which  m u st  constantly  result  in  reproducing 
the  working  m an  as  a  working  m a n,  a nd  the  capitalist  as  a  capitalist. 

30. 

T he  Rate  of  Surplus  value  will,  all  other  circumstances  r e m a i n i ng  the 

same,  d e p e nd  on  the  proportion  between  that  part  of the  working  day,  nec 
essary  to  reproduce  the  value  of the  labouring  power,  a nd  t he  surplustime  or 
surplus  labour,  performed  for  the  capitalist.  It  will,  therefore,  d e p e nd  on  the 
ratio  in  which  the  working  day  is prolonged  over  and  above  that  extent,  by  work 
ing  which  the  working  m an  would  only  reproduce  the  value  of  his  labour 
ing  power,  or  replace  his  wages.

Value,  price  and  profit 

9)  (Value  of Labour.) 

We  must  now  return  to  the  expression: 

'Value  or  Price  of Labour". 

We  have  seen  t h at  it  is  in  fact  only  t he  value  of  t he  L a b o u r i ng  Power, 
measured  by  t he  values  of  the  c o m m o d i t i es  necessary  for  its  m a i n t e n a n c e. 
5  But  since  the  w o r k m an  receives  his  wages  after  his  l a b o ur  is  performed, 
and  knows,  moreover,  that  what  he  actually  gives  to  the  capitalist,  is  his  la 
bour,  the  value  or  price  of his  labouring  power  necessarily  appears  to  h i m, 
as  the  price  or  value  of his  labour  itself.  If the  price  of  his  labouring  power  is 
3sh.,  in  which  6  h o u rs  of  labour  are  realised,  and  if  he  works  12  hours,  he 
10  necessarily  considers  these  3sh.  as  the  value  or  price  of  12  h o u rs  of labour, 
although  t h e se  12  h o u rs  of  labour  realise  themselves  in  a  value  of  6sh.  A 
double  c o n s e q u e n ce  flows  from  this. 

Firstly,  the  value  or price  of the  labouring  power  takes  the  s e m b l a n ce  of  t he 
Price  or  Value  of Labour  itself,  although,  strictly  speaking,  value  a nd  price  of 
labour  are  senseless  terms. 

15 

Secondly:  A l t h o u gh  o ne  part  only  of  the  w o r k m a n 's  daily  labour  is  paid, 

while  the  other  part  is  unpaid,  and  while  t h at  u n p a id  or  surplus  labour  con 
stitutes  exactly  the  fund  o ut  of  which  surplusvalue  or  profit  is  formed,  it 
seems  as  if  the  aggregate  labour  was  paid  labour. 

' 

20 

This  false  a p p e a r a n ce  distinguishes  wages'  labour  from  other  historical 
forms  of labour.  On  the  basis  of the  wages'  system,  even  t he  unpaid  labour 
seems  to  be  p a id  labour.  W i th  the  slave,  on  the  contrary,  even  t h at  part  of 
his  labour,  which  is  paid,  appears  to  be  u n p a i d.  Of course,  in  order  to  work, 
the  slave  m u st  live,  a nd  o ne  part  of his  working  day  goes  to  replace  the  val-
25  ue  of  his  own  m a i n t e n a n c e.  But  since  no  bargain  is  struck  between  h im 
and  his  master,  a nd  no  acts  of selling  a nd  buying  are  going  on  between  the 
two  parties,  all  his  labour  seems  to  be  given  away  for  n o t h i n g. 

.. 

Take  on  the  other  h a nd  the  peasant  serf,  such,  as  he,  I  m i g ht  say,  still 
yesterday,  existed  in  the  whole  East  of  Europe.  This  p e a s a nt  worked  f.i. 
30  3  days  for  himself  on  his  own  field,  or  the  field  allotted  to  h i m,  a nd  t he 
three  s u b s e q u e nt  days  he  performed  compulsory  a nd  gratuitous  l a b o ur  on 
the  estate  of his  lord.  Here,  t h e n,  t he  paid  a nd  u n p a id  parts  of labour  were 
visibly  separated,  separated  in  t i me  and  space,  a nd  o ur  liberals  overflowed 
with  moral  i n d i g n a t i on  at  the  preposterous  n o t i on  of  m a k i ng  a  m an  work 

'. 

35  for nothing. 

In  point  of  fact,  however,  whether  a  m an  works  3  days  of  the  week  for 
himself  on  his  own  field,  and  three  days  for  n o t h i ng  on  the  estate  of  his 
lord,  or  whether  he  works  in  the  factory  or  the  workshop  6  h o u rs  daily  for 
himself,  a nd  6  for  his  employer,  comes  to  the  same,  although  in  the  latter 

171 

Karl  Marx 

case  the  paid  a nd  u n p a id  portions  of  labour  are  inseparably  m i x ed  up  with 
e a ch  other,  a nd  t he  n a t u re  of  the  whole  transaction  is  completely  masked 
by  the  intervention  of a  contract,  a nd  the  pay  received  at  t he  e nd  of t he  week. 
T he  gratuitous  labour  appears  to  be  voluntarily  given  in  t he  o ne  instance, 
and  to  be  compulsory  in  the  other.  T h at  m a k es  all  the  difference. 

In  using  the  word  "value  of labour",  I  shall  only  use  it  as  a  p o p u l ar  slang 

t e rm  for  "value  of  the  labouring  power". 

10)  (Profit  is  made  by  selling 
a  commodity  at  its  value.) 

total  value  of  the  product  would, 

Suppose  an  average  h o ur  of labour  to  be  realised  in  a  value,  equal  to  6d.,  or  10"« 
12  average  h o u rs  of  labour  to  be  realised  in  6sh.  Suppose  further  the  value 
of  labour  to  be  3sh.,  or  the  produce  of  6  h o u r s'  labour.  If,  t h e n,  in  the  raw 
material,  machinery,  and  so  forth,  used  up  in  a  c o m m o d i t y,  24  average 
h o u rs  of labour  were  realised,  its  value  would  a m o u nt  to  12sh.  If,  moreover, 
the  w o r k m an  employed  by  the  capitalist,  a d d ed  12  h o u rs  of l a b o ur  to  those  15¾ 
m e a ns  of production,  these  12  h o u rs  would  be  realised  in  an  additional  val 
ue  of  6sh.  T he 
36  h o u rs  of  realised  labour,  a nd  be  equal  to  18sh.  But  as  the  value  of  la 
bour,  or  the  wages  paid  to  the  workman,  would  be  3sh.  only,  no  equivalent 
would  have  b e en  p a id  by  the  capitalist  for  the  6  h o u rs  of  surplus  labour,  20  \ 
worked  by  the  workman,  a nd  realised  in  t he  value  of  t he  c o m m o d i t y.  By 
selling  this  c o m m o d i ty  at  its  value,  for  18sh.,  t he  capitalist  would,  there 
fore,  realise  a  value  of  3sh.,  for  which  he  h ad  p a id  no  equivalent.  These 
3sh.  would  constitute  the  surplus  value  or  profit,  pocketed  by  h i m.  T he  cap 
italist  would,  consequently,  realise  the  profit  of  3sh.,  n ot  by  selling  his  25Ì 
c o m m o d i ty  at  a  price  over  and  above  its  value,  b ut  by  selling  it  at  its  real 
value. 

therefore,  a m o u nt 

to 

T he  value  of  a  c o m m o d i ty  is  d e t e r m i n ed  by  the 

total  quantity  of  labour 
c o n t a i n ed  in  it.  But  part  of that  quantity  of l a b o ur  is  realised  in  a  value,  for 
which  an  equivalent  has  b e en  paid  in  the  form  of wages;  part  of  it  is  real 
ised  in  a  value,  for  which  no  equivalent  has  b e en  paid.  Part  of  the  labour; 
c o n t a i n ed  in  the  c o m m o d i t y,  is  paid  labour;  part  is  unpaid  labour.  By  sell 
ing,  therefore,  the  c o m m o d i ty  at  its  value,  t h at  is  as  the  crystallisation  of the 
total  quantity  of labour  bestowed  u p on  it,  the  capitalist  m u st  necessarily  sell 
it  at  a  profit.  He  sells  n ot  only,  what  has  cost  h im  an  equivalent,  b ut  he 
sells  also  what  has  cost  h im  nothing,  although  it  has  cost  the  labour  of his 
workman.  T he  cost  of the  c o m m o d i ty  to  the  capitalist,  a nd  its  real  cost,  are 

172 

Value,  price  and  profit 

different  things.  I  repeat,  therefore,  that  n o r m al  a nd  average  profits  are 
made  by  selling  c o m m o d i t i es  n ot  above,  b ut  at  their  real  values.  \

is  realised,  I  call 

The  surplusvalue,  or  that  part  of t he  total  value  of t he  c o m m o d i t y,  in  w h i ch 
the  surplus  labour  or  unpaid  labour  of  the  workingman 
Profit.  T he  whole  of t h at  profit  is  n ot  pocketed  by  the  employing  capitalist. 
The  monopoly  of  land  enables  the  landlord  to  vindicate  o ne  part  of  t h at 
surplusvalue,  u n d er  the  n a me  of  rent,  whether  the  land  be  used  for  agricul 
ture,  or  buildings,  or  railways,  or  for  any  other  productive  purpose.  On  the 
other  h a n d,  the  very  fact,  that  the  possession  of the  means  of labour,  enables 
the  employing  capitalist  to  p r o d u ce  a  surplus  value,  or  what  c o m es  to  the 
same,  to  appropriate  to  himself  a  certain  amount  of  unpaid  labour,  enables  the 
owner  of  the  m e a ns  of  labour,  which  he  lends  wholly  or  partly  to  the  e m 
ploying  capitalist,  enables  in  o ne  word  the  money  lending  capitalist  to  claim 
for  himself,  u n d er  the  n a me  of  interest,  another  part  of  t h at  surplus  value, 
so  that  there  r e m a i ns  to  the  employing  capitalist  as such  only  what  is  called 
industrial  or  commercial  profit. 

By  what  laws  this  division  of  the  total  a m o u nt  of  surplusvalue  a m o n g st 
these  three  categories  of  people  is  regulated,  is  a  question  quite  foreign 
from  our  subject.  This  m u c h,  however,  results  from  what  has  b e en  stated. 

Rent, 

Interest,  and  Industrial  Profit  are  only  different  names  for  different 
parts  of  the  surplus  value  of  t he  c o m m o d i t y,  or  the  unpaid  labour,  realised  in 
it,  and  they  are  equally  derived from  this  source,  and  from 
this  source  alone. 
They  are  n ot  derived  from  land  as  such,  n or  from  capital  as  such,  b ut  land 
and  capital  enable  their  owners  to  get  their  respective  shares  out  of  the  sur 
plus  value,  extracted  by  the  employing  capitalist  from  the  labourer.  F or  the 
labourer  himself,  it  is  a  m a t t er  of  subordinate  i m p o r t a n c e,  whether  t h at 
surplus  value,  the  result  of  his  surplus  labour  or  u n p a id  labour,  be  alto 
gether  pocketed  by 
latter  be 
obliged  to  pay  portions  of it,  u n d er  the  n a m es  of r e nt  a nd  interest,  away  to 
third  parties.  Suppose  the  employing  capitalist  to  use  only  h is  own  capital, 
and  to  be  his  own  landlord,  a nd  the  whole  surplusvalue  would  go  into  his 
pocket. 

t he  employing  capitalist,  or  whether  the 

It  is  the  employing  capitalist,  who  immediately  extracts  from  the  la 
bourer  this  surplusvalue,  whatever  part  of  it  he  m ay  ultimately  be  able  to 
keep  for  himself.  U p on  this  relation,  therefore,  between  the  employing  cap-

173 

Karl  Marx 

italist  and  t he  wages'  labourer,  the  whole  wages  system  a nd  t he  whole  pres 
ent  system  of p r o d u c t i on  hinge.  S o me  of the  citizens,  who  took  part  in  our 
debate,  were,  therefore,  wrong  in  trying  to  m i n ce  matters,  a nd  to  treat  this 
fundamental  relation  between  the  employing  capitalist  a nd  t he  working 
m an  as  a  secondary  question,  although  they  were  right  in  stating,  that,  un 
der  given  circumstances,  a  rise  of  prices  m i g ht  affect  in  very  u n e q u al  de 
grees  the  employing  capitalist,  the  landlord,  the  m o n i ed  capitalist,  and,  if 
you  please,  the  taxgatherer. 

A n o t h er  c o n s e q u e n ce  follows  from  what  h as  b e en  stated. 
T h at  part  of  t he  value  of  the  c o m m o d i t y,  which  presents  only  the  value  10.. 

of the  raw  materials,  the  machinery,  in  o ne  word,  the  value  of the  m e a ns  of 
production  used  u p,  forms  no  revenue  at  all,  b ut  replaces  only  capital.  But 
apart  from  this,  it  is  false  that  the  other  part  of the  value  of the  commodity, 
which forms  revenue,  or  m ay  be  spent  in  t he  form  of wages,  profits,  rents,  in 
terest,  is  constituted  by  the  value  of  wages,  the  value  of  rent,  the  value  of 
profit,  a nd  so  forth.  We  shall,  in  the  first  instance,  discard  wages,  and  only 
treat  industrial  profit,  interest,  a nd  rent.  We  have j u st  seen,  t h at  the  surplus-
value  c o n t a i n ed  in  the  commodity,  or  t h at  part  of its  value,  in  which  unpaid 
labour  is  realised,  dissolves  itself  into  different  fractions,  bearing  three  dif 
ferent  n a m e s.  But  it  would  be  quite  the  reverse  of the  t r u th  to  say,  thai  its  20-,f 
value  is  composed  of,  or  formed  by,  the  addition  of  t he  independent  values  of 
these 

three  constituents. 

If one  h o ur  of labour  realises  itself in  a  value  of 6d.,  if the  working  day  of 
the  labourer  comprises  12  hours,  if  half  of  this  t i me  is  u n p a id  labour,  that 
surplus  labour  will  a dd  to  the  c o m m o d i ty  a  surplus  value  of  3sh.,  that  is  of  25| 
value  for  w h i ch  no  equivalent  has  b e en  paid.  This  surplusvalue  of 3sh.  con 
stitutes  the  whole fund  which  the  employing  capitalist  m ay  divide,  in  what 
ever  proportions,  with  the  landlord  a nd  the  m o n ey  lender.  T he  value  of 
these  3sh.  constitutes  the  limit  of  the  value  they  have  to  divide  amongst 
each  other.  B ut  it  is  n ot  t he  employing  capitalist  who  a d ds  to  the  value  of  30j 
the  c o m m o d i ty  an  arbitrary  value  for  his  profit,  to  which  a n o t h er  value  is 
a d d ed  for  the  landlord,  and  so  forth,  so  that  the  a d d i t i on  of  those  arbi 
trarily  fixed  values  would  constitute  the  total  value.  Y ou  see,  therefore,  the 
fallacy  of  the  popular  notion,  which  confounds  t he  decomposition  of  a  giv 
en  value  into  three  different  parts,  with  the  formation  of  t h at  value  by  the 
addition  of  three  independent  values,  t h us  converting  t he  aggregate  value, 
from  which  rent,  profit,  a nd  interest  are  derived,  into  an  arbitrary  magni 
t u d e. 

If  the  total  profit,  realised  by  a  capitalist,  be  equal  to  100/.,  we  call  this 
s u m,  considered  as  an  absolute  m a g n i t u d e,  the  amount  of profit.  But  if  we 
calculate  the  ratio  which  those  100/.  b e ar  to  t he  capital  advanced,  we  call 

40| 

174 

Value,  price  and  profit 

this  relative  m a g n i t u d e,  the  rate  of  profit.  It  is  evident,  that  this  rate  of  profit 
may  be  expressed  in  a  d o u b le  way. 

Suppose  100/.  to  be  the  capital,  advanced  in  wages.  If  the  surplus  value 
created  is  also  /.  1 0 0 — a nd  this  would  show  us,  that  half the  working  day  of 
the  labourer  consists  of  unpaid  l a b o u r — a nd  if  we  m e a s u r ed  this  profit  by 
the  value  of  the  capital  advanced  in  wages,  we  should  say,  that  t he  rate  of 
profit  a m o u n t ed  to  100 %,  b e c a u se  t he  value  a d v a n c ed  would  be  100,  a nd 
the  value  realised  would  be  200. 

If,  on  the  other  h a n d,  we  should  n ot  only  consider  the  capital  advanced  in 
wages,  b ut  the  total  capital  advanced,  say  f.i.  500/.,  of  which  400/.  repre 
sented  the  value  of  raw  materials,  machinery,  a nd  so  forth,  we  should  say 
that  the  rate  of profit  a m o u n t ed  only  to  20%,  because  the  profit  of  100 
would  be  b ut  the  fifth  part  of  the  total  capital  advanced. 

The  first  m o de  of  expressing  the  rate  of  profit  is  the  only  o ne  which 
shows  you  the  real  ratio  between  paid  a nd  u n p a id  labour,  the  real  degree  of 
the  exploitation  (you  m u st  allow  me  this  F r e n ch  word)  of labour.  T he  other 
mode  of  expression  is  that  in  c o m m on  use,  a nd  is  i n d e ed  appropriate  for 
certain  purposes.  At  all  events,  it  is  very  useful  for  concealing  the  degree, 
in  which  the  capitalist  extracts  gratuitous  l a b o ur  from  the  workman. 

In  the  remarks  I  have  still  to  m a k e,  I  shall  u se  t he  word  Profit  for  t he 
whole  a m o u nt  of surplusvalue,  extracted  from  the  capitalist  without  any  re 
gard  to  the  division  of  that  surplusvalue  between  different  parties,  a nd  in 
using  the  words  Rate  of Profit,  I  shall  always  m e a s u re  profits  by  the  value  of 
the  capital  advanced  in  wages.  |

12  hours  of  average  labour  crystallise  themselves  in  an  a m o u nt  of  gold 
equal  to  6sh.,  this  additional  value  of  6sh.  is  the  only  value  his  l a b o ur  will 
have  created.  This  given  value,  d e t e r m i n ed  by  the  t i me  of his  labour,  is  the 
only  fund,  from  which,  b o th  he  a nd  the  capitalist,  have  to  draw  their  re 
spective  shares  or  dividends,  the  only  value  to  be  divided  into  wages  a nd 
profits.  It  is  evident  that  this  value  itself will  n ot  be  altered  by  the  variable 

175 

Karl  Marx 

proportions,  in  which  it  m ay  be  divided  a m o n g st  the  two  parties.  There  will 
also  be  n o t h i ng  changed,  if  in  the  place  of  o ne  workingman,  you  p ut  the 
whole  working  population,  12  millions  of working  days  f.i.,  instead  of one. 
Since  t he  capitalist  a nd  the  w o r k m an  have  only  to  divide  this  limited 
value,  t h at  is  the  value  m e a s u r ed  by  t he  total  labour  of  the  workingman, 
the  m o re  t he  o ne  gets,  the  less  will  the  other  get,  a nd  vice  versa.  Whenever 
a  quantity  is  given,  o ne  part  of  it  will  increase  inversely  as  t he  other  de 
creases.  If the  wages  change,  profits  will  c h a n ge  in  an  opposite  direction.  If 
wages  fall,  profits  will  rise,  and  if wages  rise,  profits  will  fall.  If the  working 
m a n,  on  our  former  supposition,  gets  3sh.,  e q u al  to  one  half of the  value  he 
has  created,  or  if  his  whole  working  day  consists  half  of  paid,  a nd  half  of 
u n p a id  labour,  the  rate  of  profit  will  be  100%,  b e c a u se  t he  capitalist  would 
also  get  3sh.  If  the  workingman  receives  only  2sh.,  or  works  only  %  of  the 
whole  day  for  himself,  the  capitalist  will  get  4sh.,  a nd  the  rate  of profit  will 
be  200  %.  If  the  working  m an  receives  4sh.,  t he  capitalist  will  only  receive 
two,  and  t he  rate  of profit  would  sink  to  50 %,  b ut  all  these  variations  will 
n ot  affect  the  value  of the  c o m m o d i t y.  A  general  rise  of wages  would,  there 
fore,  result  in  a  fall  of  the  general  rate  of  profit,  b ut  n ot  affect  values. 

But  although  the  values  of  commodities,  which  m u st  ultimately  regulate 
their  marketprices,  are  exclusively  d e t e r m i n ed  by  the  total  quantities  of la 
b o ur  fixed  in  t h e m,  a nd  n ot  by  the  division  of  that  quantity  into  paid  and 
u n p a id  labour,  it  does  by  no  m e a ns  follow,  that  the  values  of  the  single 
c o m m o d i t i es  or  lots  of  c o m m o d i t i es  p r o d u c ed  during  12  h o u rs  f.i.  will  re 
m a in  constant.  T he  number  or  m a ss  of  c o m m o d i t i e s,  p r o d u c ed  in  a  given 
t i me  of  labour,  or  by  a  given  quantity  of  labour,  d e p e n ds  u p on  the  produc 
tive  power  of  the  labour  employed,  a nd  n ot  u p on  its  extent,  or  length.  With 
o ne  degree  of t he  productive  power  of s p i n n i ng  labour  f.i.  a  working  day  of 
12  h o u rs  m ay  produce  121bs  of  yarn,  with  a  lesser  degree  of  productive 
power  only  21bs.  If t h en  12  h o u r s'  average  l a b o ur  were  realised  in  the  value 
of 6sh.,  in  the  o ne  case  t he  121bs  of yarn  would  cost  6sh.,  in  the  other  case 
the  21bs  of  yarn  would  also  cost  6sh.  O ne  lb  of yarn  would,  therefore,  cost 
6d.  in  t he  one  case,  a nd  3sh.  in  the  other.  T he  difference  of price  would  re 
sult  from  the  difference  in  the  productive  powers  of  the  l a b o ur  employed. 
O ne  h o ur  of  labour  would  be  realised  in  o ne  lb  of  yarn,  with  the  greater 
productive  power,  while  with  the  smaller  productive  power,  6  h o u rs  of  la 
b o ur  would  be  realised  in  l ib  of  yarn.  T he  price  of  a  lb  of  yarn  would,  in 
the  o ne  instance,  be  only  6d,  although  wages  were  relatively  high  and  the 
rate  of  profit  low;  it  would  be  3sh.  in  the  other  instance,  although  wages 
were  low  and  the  rate  of profit  high.  This  would  be  so,  b e c a u se  t he  price  of 
the  lb  of yarn  is  regulated  by  the  total  amount  of labour  worked  up  in  it,  and 
n ot  by 

the  proportional  division  of  that  total  amount  into  paid  and  unpaid  la-

13)  (Main  cases  of attempts  at  rising  wages 
or  resisting  their  fall.) 

1)  Let  us  n ow  seriously  consider  t he  m a in  cases  in  which  a  rise  of wages  is 
attempted  or  a  r e d u c t i on  of  wages  resisted. 

We  have  seen:  that  the  value  of  the  labouring  power,  or  in  m o re  popular 
parlance,  t he  value  of  labour,  is  d e t e r m i n ed  by  the  value  of  necessaries,  or 
the  quantity  of  labour  required  to  p r o d u ce  t h e m.  If  t h e n,  in  a  given  c o u n 
try,  the  value  of  the  daily  average  necessaries  of  the  labourer  represented 
6  hours  of  labour,  expressed  in  3sh.,  labourer  would  have  to  work  6  h o u rs 
daily  to  p r o d u ce  an  equivalent  for  his  daily  m a i n t e n a n c e.  If  t he  whole 
working  day  was  12  h o u r s,  the  capitalist  would  pay  h im  the  value  of his  la 
bour  by  paying  h im  3sh.  Half the  working  day  would  be  u n p a id  labour,  a nd 
the  rate  of profit  would  m o u nt  to  100  %.  But  now  suppose  that,  c o n s e q u e nt 
upon  a  decrease  of productivity,  m o re  labour  should  be  wanted  to  p r o d u ce 
say  the  s a me  a m o u nt  of  agricultural  p r o d u c e,  so  that  the  price  of  the  aver 
age  daily  necessaries  should  rise  from  3  to  4sh.  In  that  case  the  value  of la 
bour would  rise  by  ]/3  or  33¾  %.  Eight  h o u rs  of t he  working  day  would  be  re 
quired  to  p r o d u ce  an  equivalent  for  the  daily  m a i n t e n a n ce  of the  labourer, 
according  to  his  old  standard  of  living.  T he  surplus  labour  would  therefore 
sink  from  6  h o u rs  to  4,  a nd  the  rate  of profit  from  100  to  50  %.  But  in  insist 
ing  upon  a  rise  of wages,  the  labourer  would  only  insist  u p on  getting  the  in 
creased  value  of his  labour,  like  every  other  seller  of  a  c o m m o d i t y,  who,  the 
costs  of  his  c o m m o d i t i es  having  increased,  tries  to  get  its  increased  value 
paid.  If wages  did  n ot  rise,  or  not  sufficiently  rise,  to  c o m p e n s a te  for  the  in 
creased  values  of necessaries,  the  price  of  labour  would  sink  below  the  value 
of labour,  a nd  t he  labourer's  standard  of  life  would  deteriorate. 

But  a  change  m i g ht  also  take  place  in  an  opposite  direction.  By  virtue  of 
the  increased  productivity  of  labourer,  the  s a me  a m o u nt  of  the  average 
daily  necessaries,  m i g ht  sink  from  3sh.  to  2,  or  only  4  h o u rs  o ut  of  t he 
working  day,  instead  of 6,  be  wanted  to  r e p r o d u ce  an  equivalent  for  the  val-

177 

Karl Marx 

ue  of t he  daily  necessaries.  T he  w o r k i n g m an  would  now  be  able  to  b uy  with 
2sh.  as  m a ny  necessaries  as  he  did  before  with  3sh.  I n d e e d,  t he  value  of la­
bour  w o u ld  h a ve  sunk,  b ut  t h at  d i m i n i s h ed  value  w o u ld  c o m m a nd  the 
s a me  a m o u nt  of c o m m o d i t i es  as  before.  T h en  profits  w o u ld  rise  from  3sh. 
to  4,  a nd t he r a te  of profit,  from  100  to  200 %.  A l t h o u gh t he  labourer's  abso­
lute  s t a n d a rd  of life  would  have  r e m a i n ed  t he  s a m e,  his  relative  wages,  and, 
therewith,  his  relative  social  position,  as  c o m p a r ed  to  t h at  of  t he  capitalist, 
would  have  b e en  lowered.  If t he  working  m an  should  resist  t h at  reduction 
of relative  wages,  he  w o u ld  only  try  to  get  s o me  s h a re  in  t he  i n c r e a s ed  pro­
ductive  powers  of his  own  labour,  a nd  to  m a i n t a in  his  former  relative  posi-  % 
t i on  in  t he  social  scale.  T h u s,  after  t he  abolition  of t he  ||14|  Cornlaws,  and 
ί 
in  flagrant  violation  of  t he  m o st  s o l e mn  pledges  given  d u r i ng  t he  Anti-
C o rn  Law  Agitation,  t he  English  factory  lords  generally  r e d u c ed  wages  by

regained. 

2)  T he  values  of necessaries,  a nd  c o n s e q u e n t ly  the  value  of labour,  might

m i g ht  f.i.  cost  no  m o re  l a b o ur  to  p r o d u ce  t h an  o ne  o u n ce  did  before.  The 
value  of gold  would  t h en  be  depreciated  by  o ne  half  or  by  50  %.  As  t he  val­
ues  of all  o t h er  c o m m o d i t i es  would  t h en  be  expressed  in  twice  their  former 
moneyprices,  t h us  t he  s a me  value  of labour.  Twelve  h o u rs  of labour,  formerly 
expressed  in  6sh.,  would  now  be  expressed  in  12sh.  If  t he  workingman's  2"¾ 
wages  would  r e m a in  3sh.,  instead  of  rising  to  6sh.,  t he  moneyprice  of hü  la 
bour  w o u ld  only  be  e q u al  to  half  the  value  of his  labour,  a nd  h is  standard  of 
life  would  fearfully  deteriorate.  This  would  also  h a p p en  in  a  greater  or  ; 
lesser  degree,  if his  wages  should  rise,  but  n ot  proportionately  to  t he  fall  in 
t he  value  of gold.  In  such  a  case  n o t h i ng  would  have  b e en  changed,  neither  ; 
in  t he  productive  powers  of  labour,  nor  in  supply  and  d e m a n d,  n or  in  val-; 
u e s.  N o t h i ng  would  have  changed  except  t he  m o n ey  names  of those  values.  ? 
To  say,  t h at  in  s u ch  a  case,  t he  w o r k m an  o u g ht  n ot  to  insist  u p on  a  propor 
t i o n a te  rise  of  wages,  is  to  say,  that  he  m u st  be  c o n t e nt  to  be  paid  with 
n a m e s,  instead  of with  things.  All  past  history  proves,  that  whenever  such  a  M 
depreciation  of  m o n ey  occurs,  t he  capitalists  are  on  t he  alert  to  seize  this  3 
opportunity  for  defrauding  the  w o r k m e n.  A  very  large  school  of  Pol.  Econ-  M 
omists  asserts,  that,  c o n s e q u e nt  u p on  t he  new  discoveries  of goldlands,  the  m 
better  working  of  silver  mines,  a nd  t he  c h e a p er  supply  of  quicksilver,  the  m 
value  of  precious  m e t a ls  h as  b e en  again  depreciated.  This  would  explain 
t he  general  a nd  s i m u l t a n e o us  attempts,  on  the  c o n t i n e n t,  at  a  rise  of wages.

3)  We  have  till  now  supposed  t h at  t he  working  day  has  given  limits.  T he 
working  day,  however,  has,  by  itself,  no  constant  limits.  It  is  t he  constant 
tendency  of capital  to  stretch  it  to  its  u t m o st  physically  possible  length,  be 
cause  in  t he  s a me  degree  surpluslabour,  a nd  consequently  the  profit  result-
ing  therefrom,  will  be  increased.  T he  m o re  capital  succeeds  in  prolonging 
the  working  day,  the  greater  the  a m o u nt  of other  peoples'  labour  it  will  ap 
propriate.  D u r i ng  the  1 7t h,  a nd  even  the  two  first  thirds  of the  1 8th  century, 
a  10  h o u r s'  working  day  was  t he  n o r m al  working  day  all  over  England.  D u r 
ing  the  A n ti  J a c o b in  war,  which  was  in  fact  a  war  waged  by  the  British  Bar 

io  ons  against  the  British  working  masses,  capital  celebrated  its  bacchanalia, 
and  prolonged  the  working  day  from  10  to  12,  14,  18  h o u r s.  Malthus,  by  no

clared  in  a  pamphlet,  published  a b o ut  1815,  t h at  if this  sort  of thing  was  to 
go  on,  the  life  of  the  n a t i on  would  be  attacked  in  its  very  source.  A  few 
15  years  before  the  general  i n t r o d u c t i on  of  the  newly  invented  m a c h i n e r y, 
about  1765,  a  p a m p h l et  appeared  in  England  u n d er  the  title:  "An  Essay  on 
Trade".  T he  a n o n y m o us  author,  an  avowed  e n e my  of  the  working  classes, 
declaims  on  the  necessity  of  expanding  the  limits  of  the  working  day. 
Amongst  other  m e a ns  to  this  end,  he  proposes  working  houses,  which,  he 

) 

says,  ought  to  be  "Houses  of  Terror".  A nd  what  is  the  length  of t he  working 
day  he  prescribes  for  these  "Houses  of  Terror"?  Twelve  hours,  the  very  s a me 
time  which,  in  1832,  was  declared  by  capitalists,  political  economists,  a nd 
ministers,  to  be  n ot  only  the  existing,  b ut  t he  necessary  t i me  of l a b o ur  for  a

By  selling  his  labouring  power,  a nd  he  m u st  do  so  u n d er  the  present  sys

order  to  m a i n t a in  it,  apart  from  its  n a t u r al  tear  a nd  wear,  b ut  not  to  destroy 
it.  In  selling  his  labouring  power  at  its  daily  or  weekly  value,  it  is  u n d e r-
stood  that  in  o ne  day  or  o ne  week,  that  labouring  power  shall  n ot  be  s u b 
mitted  to  2  days  or  2  weeks  waste,  or  wear  and  tear.  Take  a  m a c h i n e,  worth 
1000/.  If  it  is  used  up  in  10  years,  it  will  a dd  to  the  value  of the  c o m m o d i 
ties,  in  whose  p r o d u c t i on  it  assists,  100/.  yearly.  If it  be  used  up  in  5  years, 
it  would  add  200/.  yearly,  or  the  value  of  its  a n n u al  wear  a nd  tear  is  in  in-
5  verse  ratio  to  t he  quickness  with  which  it  is  c o n s u m e d.  But  this  distin 
guishes  the  working  m an  from  the  m a c h i n e.  M a c h i n e ry  does  n ot  wear  out 
exactly  in  t he  s a me  ratio  in  which  it  is  u s e d.  M a n,  on  the  contrary,  decays 
in  a  greater  ratio  t h an  would  be  visible  from  t he  m e re  n u m e r i c al  addition

In  prolonging  t he  working  day,  t he  capitalist  m ay  p ay  higher  wages,  and

Even  with  given  limits  of  t he  working  day,  such  as  they  n ow  exist  in  all 

b r a n c h es  of  industry  subjected  to  t he  factory  laws,  a  rise  of  wages  m ay  be­

sity  of  labour,  t he  working  m an  only  resists  t he  d e p r e c i a t i on  of  his  labour, 

a nd  t he  d e t e r i o r a t i on  of  his  race. 

4)  All  of y ou  know  that,  from  reasons  I  have  n ot  now  to  explain,  capital­

istic  p r o d u c t i on  moves  t h r o u gh  certain  periodical  cycles.  It  m o v es  through  ν 

a  state  of  quiescence,  growing  a n i m a t i o n,  prosperity,  overtrade,  crisis,  and 

: 

stagnation.  T he  marketprices  of  c o m m o d i t i e s,  a nd  t he  m a r k et  rates  of 

180 

Value,  price  and  profit 

is  sure  to  have  his  wages 

profit,  follow  these  phases,  now  sinking  below  their  averages,  n ow  rising 
above  t h e m.  C o n s i d e r i ng  the  whole  cycle,  you  will  find  t h at  o ne  deviation 
of t he  m a r k e t p r i ce  is  being  c o m p e n s a t ed  by  t he  other,  a nd  that,  taking  t he 
average  of  the  cycle,  t he  marketprices  of  c o m m o d i t i es  are  regulated  by 
their  values.  Well!  D u r i ng  t he  phasis  of  sinking  marketprices,  a nd  the 
phases  of  crisis  a nd  stagnation,  the  working  m a n,  if  n ot  thrown  o ut  of  e m­
ployment  altogether, 
lowered.  To  n ot  be  de­
frauded,  he  must,  even  with  such  a  fall  of  marketprices,  d e b a te  with  the 
capitalist  in  w h at  degree  a  proportional  fall  of  wages  h as  b e c o me  necessary. 
If,  during  t he  phases  of prosperity,  w h en  extra  profits  are  m a d e,  he  battled 
not  for  a  rise  of wages,  he  would,  taking  t he  average  of o ne  industrial  cycle, 
not  even  receive  his  average  wages,  or  t he  value  of  his  labour.  It  is  t he  ut­
most  height  of  foolery  to  d e m a n d,  t h at  while  his  wages  are  necessarily  af­
fected  by  t he  adverse  phases  of t he  cycle,  he  should  exclude  himself from  a 
compensation  d u r i ng  the  prosperous  phases  of t he  cycle.  Generally,  t he  val­
ues  of all  c o m m o d i t i es  are  only  realised  by  t he  c o m p e n s a t i on  of t he  contin­
uously  changing  marketprices,  springing  from  t he  c o n t i n u o us  fluctuations 
of  d e m a nd  a nd  supply.  On  t he  basis  of t he  present  system,  labour  is  only  a 
commodity  like  others.  It  m u s t,  therefore,  pass  t h r o u gh  t he  s a me  fluctua-
tions  to  fetch  an  average  price  corresponding  to  its  value.  It  would  be  ab­
surd  to  treat  it  on  t he  o ne  h a nd  as  a  c o m m o d i t y,  a nd  to  w a nt  on  t he  o t h er 
hand  to  e x e m pt  it  from  t he  laws  which  regulate  the  prices  of  c o m m o d i t i e s. 
The  slave  receives  a  p e r m a n e nt  a nd  fixed  a m o u nt  of  m a i n t e n a n c e;  the 
wages  labourer  does  n o t.  He  m u st  try  to  get  a  rise  of  wages  in  t he  o ne  in-
stance,  if only  to  c o m p e n s a te  for  a  fall  of wages,  in  t he  other.  If he  resigned 
himself  to  accept  the  will,  t he  dictates  of  t he  capitalist  as  a  p a r a m o u nt 
economical  law,  he  would  share  in  all  the  miseries  of  the  slave,  without  the 
security  of  t he  slave.

5)  In  all  the  cases  I  have  considered,  a nd  they  form  99  o ut  of  100,  you 
have  seen  t h at  a  struggle  for  a  rise  of wages  follows  only  in  t he  track  of pre­
vious  changes,  a nd  as  their  necessary  offspring,  of  previous  changes  in  the 
amount  of p r o d u c t i o n,  the  productive  power  of labour,  t he  value  of  labour, 
the  value  of  m o n e y,  t he  extent  or  the  intensity  of  t he  l a b o ur  extracted,  the 
fluctuations  of  m a r k et  prices,  d e p e n d e nt  u p on  t he  fluctuations  of  d e m a nd 
and  supply,  a nd  coexistent  with  the  different  phases  of the  industrial  cycle; 
Τ 
in  one  word,  as  reactions  of  labour  against  t he  previous  a c t i on  of  capital. 
èri  By  treating  the  struggles  for  a  rise  of  wages  i n d e p e n d e n t ly  of  all  these  cir-
cumstances,  by  looking  only  u p on  the  change  of wages,  a nd  overlooking  all 
I 
the  other  changes  from  w h i c h , t h ey  e m a n a t e,  you  proceed  from  a  false

premise  in  order  to  arrive  at  false  conclusions.

14)  (The  struggle  between  capital  and  labour, 
and  its  results.) 

1)  Having  shown,  that  the  periodical  resistance  on  the  part  of t he  working-
m en  against  a  r e d u c t i on  of wages,  a nd  their  periodical  attempts  at  getting  a 
rise  of  wages,  are  inseparable  from  the  wages  system,  a nd  dictated  by  the 
very  fact  of  l a b o ur  being  assimilated  to  c o m m o d i t i e s,  a nd  therefore  subject 
to  t he  laws  regulating  the  general  m o v e m e nt  of prices;  having,  furthermore, 
shown  that  a  general  rise  of wages  would  result  in  a  fall  of the  general  rate 
of  profit,  b ut  n ot  affect  the  average  prices  of  c o m m o d i t i e s,  or  their  values; 
the  question  now,  ultimately,  arises,  how  far,  in  this  incessant  struggle  be 
tween  capital  a nd  labour,  the  latter  is  likely  to  prove  successful? 

I  might  answer  by  a  generalisation,  and  say  that,  as  with  all  other  com 
modities,  so  with  labour,  its  market price  will,  in  the  long  run,  adapt  itself to 
its  value;  that,  therefore,  despite  all  the  ups  a nd  downs,  a nd  do  what  he 
may,  the  working  m an  will,  on  an  average,  only  receive  t he  value  of  his  la 
bour,  which  dissolves  into  the  value  of his  labouring  power,  which  is  deter 
m i n ed  by  the  value  of  the  necessaries  required  for  its  m a i n t e n a n ce  a nd  re 
production,  which  value  of necessaries,  finally,  is  regulated  by  t he  quantity 
of  labour  wanted  to  produce  t h e m. 

But  there  are  some  peculiar  features  which  distinguish  the  value  of the  la 
bouring  power,  or  the  value  of labour,  from  the  values  of  all  other  c o m m o d i 
ties.  T he  value  of  the  labouring  power  is  formed  by  two  elements,  the  one 
m a i n ly  physical,  the  other  historical  or  social.  Its  ultimate  limit  is  deter 
m i n ed  by  the  physical  element,  that  is  to  say,  to  m a i n t a in  a nd  r e p r o d u ce  it 
self,  to  p e r p e t u a te  its  physical  existence,  the  working  class  m u st  receive  the 
necessaries  absolutely  indispensable  for  living  a nd  multiplying.  T he  value 
of  those  indispensable  necessaries  forms,  therefore,  the  u l t i m a te  limit  of 
the  value  of labour.  On  the  other  h a n d,  the  length  of the  working  day  is  also 
limited  by  u l t i m a t e,  although  very  elastic  b o u n d a r i e s.  Its  u l t i m a te  limit  is 
given  by  t he  physical  force  of the  labouring  m a n.  If the  daily  exhaustion  of 
his  vital  forces  exceeds  a  certain  degree,  it  can  n ot  be  exerted  anew,  day  by 
day.  However,  as  I  said,  this  limit  is  very  elastic.  A  quick  succession  of un 
healthy  a nd  shortlived  generations  will  keep  t he  labour  m a r k et  as  well  sup 
plied  as  a  series  of vigorous  a nd  longlived  generations. 

Besides  this  mere  physical  element,  the  value  of labour  is  in  every  coun 
try  d e t e r m i n ed  by  a  traditional  standard  of life.  It  is  n ot  m e re  physical  life, 
b ut  it  is  the  satisfaction  of  certain  wants  springing  from  the  social  condi 
tions  in  which  people  are  placed  and  reared  u p.  T he  English  standard  of 
life  m ay  be  r e d u c ed  to  the  Irish  standard,  the  standard  of  life  of  a  G e r m an 

182 

Value,  price  and  profit 

peasant  to  t h at  of  a  Livonian  peasant.  T he  important  part  which  historical 
tradition  a nd  social  h a b i t u de  play  in  this  respect,  y ou  m ay  learn  from  M r. 
Thornton's  work  o n:  "Overpopulation",  where  he  shows 
t he  average 
wages  in  different  agricultural  districts  of  E n g l a nd  still  n ow  a  days  differ 
5  more  or  less  according  to  the  m o re  or  less  favourable  circumstances,  u n d er 

t h at 

which  they  h ad  emerged  from  the  state  of  serfdom. 

10 

This  historical  or  social  element,  entering  into  the  value  of  labour,  m ay 
be  expanded,  or  contracted,  or  altogether  extinguished,  so  that  n o t h i ng  re 
mains  b ut  t he  physical  limit.  D u r i ng  the  t i me  of  the  Anti  Jacobin  War,  u n d e r-
taken,  as  the  incorrigible  taxeater  a nd  synecurist,  Old  George  Rose,  used  to 
say,  to  save  the  comforts  of  O ur  Holy  Religion  from  t he  inroads  of  the 
French  infidels,  the  h o n e st  English  farmers,  so  tenderly  h a n d l ed  in  a  for 
mer  sitting  of  ours,  depressed  the  wages  of  the  agricultural  labourers,  even 
beneath  that  mere  physical  minimum,  b ut  m a de  up  by  poortaxes  t he  r e m a i n-
15  der necessary  for  the  physical  p e r p e t u a t i on  of t he  race.  This  was  a  glorious 
way  to  convert  the  wages  labourer  into  a  slave  and  Shakespeare's  p r o ud 
yeoman  into  a  pauper. 

20 

By  c o m p a r i ng  the  standard  wages  or  values  of  labour  in  different  coun 
tries,  and  by  comparing  t h em  in  different  historical  epochs  of  the  s a me 
country,  you  will  find  that  the  value  of labour  itself is  n ot  a  fixed,  b ut  a  vari 
able  m a g n i t u d e,  even  supposing  t he  values  of  all  other  c o m m o d i t i es  to  re 
main  constant. 

A  similar  comparison  would  prove  that  not  only  the  marketrates  of  profit 

change,  b ut  its  average  rates. 

25 

But  as  to  profits,  there  exists  no  law  which  determines  their  minimum.  We 
cannot  say  which  is  the  ultimate  limit  of  their  decrease.  A nd  why  can  we 
not  fix  that  limit?  Because,  a l t h o u gh  we  c an  fix  the  minimum  of wages,  we 
cannot  fix  their  maximum.  We  can  only  say,  that  the  limits  of  the  working 
day  being  given,  the  maximum  of  profit  corresponds  to  the  physical  minimum 
30  of  wages;  a nd  that  wages  being  given,  the  maximum  of  profit  corresponds  to 
such  a  prolongation  of  the  working  day,  as  is  compatible  with  the  physical 
forces  of  the  labourer.  T he  m a x i m um  of  profit  is  therefore  limited  by  the 
physical  m i n i m um  of  wages  a nd  the  physical  m a x i m um  of  the  working 
day.  It  is  evident  that  between  the  two  limits  of  this  maximum  rate  of  profit, 
35  an  i m m e n se  scale  of variations  is  possible.  T he  fixation  of its  actual  degree 
is  only  settled  by  the  c o n t i n u o us  struggle  between  capital  a nd  labour;  t he 
capitalist  constantly  tending  to  r e d u ce  wages  to  their  physical  m i n i m u m, 
and  to  extend  the  working  day  to  its  physical  m a x i m u m,  while  the  working-
man  constantly  presses  in  the  opposite  direction. 

40 

The  question  resolves  itself  into  a  question  of  the  respective  powers  of 

the  c o m b a t a n t s. |

1161  2)  As  to  t he  limitation  of  the  working  day,  in  England,  as  in  all  other 

countries,  it  has  never  b e en  settled  except  by  legislative  interference.  With 
out  the  workingmen's  c o n t i n u o us  pressure  from  without,  t h at  interference 
would  never  have  t a k en  place.  But,  at  all  events,  the  result  was  n ot  to  be  at 
tained  by  private  settlement  between  the  workingmen  a nd  the  capitalists. 
This  very  necessity  of  general  political  action  affords  the  proof  that,  in  its 
merely  e c o n o m i c al  action,  capital  was  the  stronger  side. 

As  to  t he  limits  of  the  value  of  labour,  its  actual  settlement  always  de 
p e n ds  u p on  supply  a nd  d e m a n d,  I  m e an  the  d e m a nd  for  labpur  on  the  part 
of  capital,  a nd  the  supply  of  labour  by  t he  working  m e n.  In  colonial  coun 
tries,  the  law  of  supply  and  d e m a nd  favours  the  workingmen.  H e n ce  the 
relatively  h i gh  s t a n d a rd  of wages  in  the  U n.  States.  Capital  m ay  there  try  its 
u t m o s t.  It  c a n n ot  prevent  the  labour  m a r k et  from  being  continuously  emp 
tied  by  the  c o n t i n u o us  conversion  of  wages  labourers  into  independent, 
self-sustaining  peasants.  T he  function  of  a  wages'  labourer  is,  for  a  very 
large  part  of  the  A m e r i c an  people,  b ut  a  probational  state,  w h i ch  they  are 
sure  to  leave  within  a  longer  or  shorter  term.  To  m e nd  this  colonial  state  of 
things,  the  paternal  British  government  accepted  for  s o me  t i me  what  is 
called  the  m o d e rn  Colonisation  Theory,  a nd  which  consists  in  putting  an 
artificial  high  price  u p on  colonial  land,  in  order  to  prevent  t he  too  quick 
conversion  of  the  w a g e s ' l a b o u r er  into  t he  i n d e p e n d e nt  peasant. 

B ut  let  us  now  c o me  to  old  civilised  countries,  in  which  capital  domi 
neers  over  t he  whole  process  of production.  T a ke  f.i.  the  rise  in  England  of 
agricultural  wages  from  1849  to  1859.  W h at  was  its  c o n s e q u e n c e?  The 
farmers  could  not,  as  our  friend  W e s t on  would  have  advised  t h e m,  raise  the 
value  of  wheat,  n or  even  its  marketprices.  T h ey  h a d,  on  the  contrary,  to 
s u b m it  [to]  their  fall.  But  during  these  11  years,  they  i n t r o d u c ed  machinery 
of  all  sorts,  adopted  m o re  scientifick  m e t h o d s,  converted  part  of  arable 
land  into  pasture,  increased  the  size  of farms,  and,  with  it,  t he  scale  of pro 
duction,  a nd  by  these  and  other  processes,  d i m i n i s h i ng  the  d e m a nd  for  la 
bour  by  increasing  its  productive  power,  m a de  t he  agricultural  population 
again  relatively  r e d u n d a n t.  This  is  the  general  m e t h od  in  which  a  reaction, 
quicker  or  slower,  of  capital  against  a  rise  of  wages  takes  place  in  old  set 
tled  countries.  Ricardo  has  justly  remarked  that  m a c h i n e ry  is  in  constant 
c o m p e t i t i on  with  labour  a nd  can  often  be  only  introduced,  w h en  the  price 
of  l a b o ur  has  reached  a  certain  height,  b ut  the  appliance  of  machinery  is 
b ut  o ne  of  the  m a ny  m e t h o ds  for  increasing  the  productive  powers  of  la 
bour.  This  very  s a me  development,  which  m a k es  c o m m on  l a b o ur  relatively 
r e d u n d a n t,  simplifies,  on  the  other  h a n d,  skilled  labour,  a nd  t h us  depre 
ciates  it. 

T he  s a me  law  obtains  in  an  other  form.  W i th  the  d e v e l o p m e nt  of the  pro-

184 

Value,  price  and  profit 

ductive  powers  of  labour,  t he  a c c u m u l a t i on  of  capital  will  be  accelerated, 
even  despite  a  relatively  high  rate  of  wages.  H e n ce  o ne  m i g ht  infer,  as 
A.  Smith,  in  whose  days  m o d e rn  industry  was  still  in  its  infancy,  d id  infer, 
that  this  accelerated  a c c u m u l a t i on  of  capital  m u st  t u rn  the  b a l a n ce  in  fa-
5  vour  of  the  workingman,  by  securing  a  growing  d e m a nd  for  h is  labour. 
From  this  s a me  standpoint,  m a ny  contemporary  writers  have  wondered 
that,  English  capital  having  grown  in  these  last  20  years  so  m u ch  quicker 
than  English  population,  wages  should  n ot  have  b e en  m o re  e n h a n c e d.  But 
simultaneously  with  t he  progress  of  a c c u m u l a t i o n,  t h e re  t a k es  p l a ce  a  pro-
gressive  change  in  the  composition  of capital.  T h at  part  of  the  aggregate  capi 
tal,  which  consists  of fixed  capital,  machinery,  raw  materials,  m e a ns  of pro 
duction  in  all  possible  forms,  progressively  increases  as  c o m p a r ed  to  t h at 
other  part  of  capital  which  is  laid  out  in  wages,  or  in  the  p u r c h a se  of  la 
bour.  This  law  h as  b e en  stated  in  a  m o re  or  less  accurate  m a n n er  by  Mr. 
15  Barton,  R i c a r d o,  Sismondi,  Prof.  R i c h a rd  Jones,  Prof.  R a m s a y,  Cherbuliez, 

10 

and  others. 

If  the  proportion  of  those  two  elements  of  capital  was  originally  o ne  to 
one,  it  will,  in  the  progress  of industry,  b e c o me  5  to  1,  a nd  so  forth.  If of a 
total  capital  of  600,  300  is  laid  o ut  in  i n s t r u m e n t s,  raw  materials,  a nd  so 
forth,  a nd  300  in  wages,  the  total  capital  wants  only  to  be  d o u b l ed  to  create 
a  d e m a nd  for  600  w o r k i n g m en  instead  of for  300.  B ut  if of a  capital  of 600, 
500  is  laid  out  in  m a c h i n e r y,  materials,  a nd  so  forth,  a nd  100  only  in 
wages,  the  same  capital  m u st  increase  from  600  to  3600,  in  order  to  create 
a  d e m a nd  for  600  w o r k m en  instead  of for  100.  In  the  progress  of  industry, 
the  d e m a nd  for  l a b o ur  keeps,  therefore,  no  pace  with  the  a c c u m u l a t i on  of 
capital.  It  will  still  increase,  b ut  increase  in  a  constantly  d i m i n i s h i ng  ratio 
as  compared  to  t he  increase  of  capital. 

These  few  h i n ts  will  suffice  to  show,  t h at  t he  very  d e v e l o p m e nt  of  m o d 
ern  industry  m u st  progressively  t u rn  the  scales  in  favour  of  the  capitalist 
against  t he  workingman,  a nd  that,  consequently  the  general  t e n d e n cy  of 
capitalistic  p r o d u c t i on  is  n ot  to  raise,  b ut  sink  the  average  s t a n d a rd  of 
wages,  or  to  p u sh  the  value  of labour  m o re  or  less  to  its  minimum  limit.  S u ch 
being  the  t e n d e n cy  of  things  in  this  system,  is  this  to  say  t h at  t he  working 
class  ought  to  r e n o u n ce  their  resistance  against  the  e n c r o a c h m e n ts  of  capi-
tal,  and  a b a n d on  their  attempts  at  m a k i ng  the  best  of  the  occasional 
chances  for  their  temporary  i m p r o v e m e n t?  If  they  did,  they  would  be  de 
graded  to  o ne  level  m a ss  of b r o k e n d o wn  wretches  past  salvation.  I  think,  I 
have  shown,  that  their  struggles  for  the  standard  of wages  are  incidents  in 
separable  from  the  whole  wages  system,  t h at  in  99  cases  o ut  of  100,  their  ef-
forts  at  rising  wages  are  only  efforts  at  m a i n t a i n i ng  the  given  value  of  la 
bour,  a nd  t h at  the  necessity  of  debating  their  price  with  the  capitalist  is

i n h e r e nt  to  their  condition  of having  to  sell  themselves  as  c o m m o d i t i e s.  By 
cowardly  giving  way  in  their  every  days'  conflicts  with  capital,  they  would 
certainly  disqualify  themselves  for  the  initiative  of  any  larger  m o v e m e n t. 

At  the  s a me  t i m e,  a nd  quite  apart  from  the  general  servitude  involved  in 
the  wages  system,  the  working  class  ought  n ot  to  exaggerate  to  themselves 
the  u l t i m a te  working  of  those  every  days'  struggles.  They  o u g ht  n ot  to  for 
get,  t h at  they  are  fighting  with  effects,  b ut  n ot  with  the  causes  of  those  ef 
fects;  that  they  are  retarding  the  downward  m o v e m e n t,  b ut  n ot  changing  its 
direction;  t h at  they  are  applying  palliatives,  n ot  curing  the  m a l a d y.  They 
ought,  therefore,  n ot  to  be  exclusively  absorbed  in  those  u n a v o i d a b le  gue

of capital  or  changes  of the  market.  They  ought  to  u n d e r s t a nd  that,  with  all 
the  miseries  it  imposes  u p on  them,  the  present  system  s i m u l t a n e o u s ly  en 
genders 
the  material  conditions  a nd  the  social  forms  necessary  for  an  eco 
n o m i c al  reconstruction  of  society.  I n s t e ad  of  the  conservative  m o t t o:  "A fair 
day's  wages for  a fair  day's  work!",  they  ought  to  inscribe  on  their  b a n n er  the 
revolutionary  watchword:  "Abolition  of  the  wages'  System!" 

After  this  very  long,  and  I  fear  t e d i o us  exposition,  which  I  was  obliged  to 

enter  into  to  do  some  justice  to  the  subject  matter,  I  shall  c o n c l u de  by  pro 
posing  the  following  resolutions: 

/s i l0  A  general  rise  in  the  rate  of wages  would  result  in  a  fall  of the  gen 
eral  rate  of  profit,  but,  broadly  speaking,  n ot  affect  the  prices  of commodi 
ties; 

2n d l y)  T he  general  tendency  of  capitalistic  p r o d u c t i on  is  n ot  to  raise,  but 

to  sink  the  average  standard  of  wages; 

jjrdiy)  Tr ade s'  U n i o ns  work  well  as  centres  of  resistance  against  the  en 
c r o a c h m e n ts  of  capital.  They  fail  partially  from  an  injudicious  u se  of  their 
power.  T h ey  fail  generally  from 
to  a  guerilla  war 
against  the  effects  of  the  existing  System,  instead  of  simultaneously  trying 
to  change  it,  instead  of  using  their  organised  forces  as  a  lever  for  the  final 
e m a n c i p a t i on  of  the  working  class,  t h at  is  to  say,  the  u l t i m a te  abolition  of 
the  wages'  system.  |

Sir,—Wherever  the  working  classes  have  t a k en  a  part  of their  own  in  politi 
cal  m o v e m e n t s,  there,  from  the  very  beginning,  their  foreign  policy  was  ex 
pressed  in  the  few  words—Restoration  of Poland.  This  was  t he  case  with  t he 
Chartist  m o v e m e nt  so  long  as  it  existed;  this  was  the  case  with  t he  F r e n ch 
working  m en  long  before  1848,  as  well  as  during  that  m e m o r a b le  year, 
10  when  on  t he  15th  of M ay  they  m a r c h ed  on  to  the  N a t i o n al  Assembly  to  t he 

cry  of  'Vive  la  Pologne!"—Poland  for  ever!  This  was  the  case  in  G e r m a n y, 
when,  in  1848  a nd  '49,  the  organs  of the  working  class  d e m a n d ed  war  with 
Russia  for  the  restoration  of Poland.  It  is  the  case  even  now;—with  o ne  ex 
ception—of  which  m o re  a n o n — t he  working  m en  of  E u r o pe  u n a n i m o u s ly 
15  proclaim  the  restoration  of  Poland  as  a  part  a nd  parcel  of  their  political 
programme,  as  t he  most  comprehensive  expression  of  their  foreign  policy. 
The  middle-class,  too,  have  had,  a nd  have  still,  "sympathies"  with  the 
Poles;  which  sympathies  have  not  prevented  t h em  from  leaving  the  Poles  in 
the  lurch  in  1831,  in  1846,  in  1863,  nay,  have  not  even  prevented  t h em 
20  from  leaving  the  worst  e n e m i es  of  Poland,  s u ch  as  Lord  Palmerston,  to 
manage  m a t t e rs  so  as  to  actually  assist  R u s s ia  while  they  talked  in  favour 
of Poland.  But  with  the  working  classes  it  is  different.  They  m e an  interven 
tion,  not  n o n i n t e r v e n t i o n;  they  m e an  war  with  Russia  while  Russia  m e d 
dles  with  P o l a n d;  a nd  they  have  proved  it  every  t i me  the  Poles  rose  against 
their  oppressors.  A nd  recently,  the  I n t e r n a t i o n al  Working  M e n 's  Associa 
tion  has  given  a  fuller  expression  to  this  universal  instinctive  feeling  of t he 
body  it  claims  to  represent,  by  inscribing  on  its  b a n n e r,  "Resistance  to  R u s 
sian  e n c r o a c h m e n ts  u p on  E u r o p e — R e s t o r a t i on  of  Poland."

This  p r o g r a m me  of the  foreign  policy  of the  working  m en  of W e s t e rn  and 
Central  E u r o pe  h as  found  a  u n a n i m o us  c o n s e nt  a m o ng  the  class  to  whom 
it  was  addressed,  with  one  exception,  as  we  said  before.  There  are  among 
the  working  m en  of  F r a n ce  a  small  minority  who  belong  to  the  school  of 
t he  late  P. J. P r o u d h o n.  This  school  differs  in  toto  from  the  generality  of the 
advanced  a nd  thinking  working  m e n;  it  declares  t h em  to  be  ignorant  fools, 
a nd  m a i n t a i n s,  on  most  points,  opinions  q u i te  contrary  to  theirs.  This 
holds  good  in  their  foreign  policy  also.  T he  P r o u d h o n i s t s,  sitting  in  judg 
m e nt  on  oppressed  Poland, 
the  verdict  of  the  Staleybridge  jury, 
"Serves  her  right."  They  a d m i re  R u s s ia  as  the  great  land  of  the  future,  as 
the  m o st  progressive  nation  u p on  the  face  of t he  earth,  at  t he  side  of which 
s u ch  a  paltry  country  as  the  U n i t ed  States  is  n ot  worthy  of  b e i ng  n a m e d. 
They  have  charged  t he  Council  of  the  I n t e r n a t i o n al  Association  with  set 
ting  up  the  Bonapartist  principle  of  nationalities,  a nd  with  declaring  that 
m a g n a n i m o us  R u s s i an  people  without  the  pale  of  civilised  E u r o p e;  such 
being  a  grievous  sin  against  the  principles  of universal  d e m o c r a cy  and  the 
fraternity  of  all  n a t i o n s.  These  are  the  charges.  Barring  t he  democratic 
phraseology  at  t he  wind-up,  they  coincide,  it  will  be  seen  at  o n c e,  verbally 
a nd  literally  with  what  the  extreme  Tories  of all  countries  have  to  say  about 
Poland  a nd  Russia.  S u ch  charges  are  n ot  worth  refuting;  but,  as  they  come 
from  a  fraction  of  the  working  classes,  be  it  ever  so  small  a  one,  they  may 
r e n d er  it  desirable  to  state  again  the  case  of  Poland  a nd  Russia,  a nd  to 
vindicate  what  we  m ay  henceforth  call  the  foreign  policy  of  the  united 
working  m en  of  Europe. 

B ut  why  do  we  always  n a me  Russia  alone  in  c o n n e c t i on  with  Poland? 
Have  n ot  two  G e r m an  Powers,  Austria  and  Prussia,  shared  in  the  plunder? 
Do  n ot  they,  too,  hold  parts  of Poland  in  b o n d a g e,  and,  in  c o n n e c t i on  with 
Russia,  do  they  n ot  work  to  keep  down  every  n a t i o n al  Polish  m o v e m e n t? 

It  is  well  known  how  h a rd  Austria  has  struggled  to  keep  o ut  of the  Polish 
business;  how  long  she  resisted  the  plans  of Russia  a nd  Prussia  for  the  par 
tition.  Poland  was  a  n a t u r al  ally  of  Austria  against  Russia.  W h en  Russia 
o n ce  b e c a me  formidable,  n o t h i ng  could  be  m o re  in  the  interest  of Austria 
t h an  to  k e ep  Poland  alive  between  herself  a nd  t he  newly-rising  Empire.  It 
was  only  w h en  Austria  saw  that  Poland's  fate  was  settled,  that  with  or  with 
o ut  her,  t he  other  two  Powers  were  d e t e r m i n ed  to  a n n i h i l a te  her,  it  was 
only  t h en  t h at  in  self-protection  she  went  in  for  a  share  of the  territory.  But 
as  early  as  1815  she  held  out  for  the  restoration  of an  i n d e p e n d e nt  Poland; 
in  1831  a nd  in  1863  she  was  ready  to  go  to  war  for  that  object,  a nd  give  up 
her  own  share  of  Poland,  provided  England  a nd  F r a n ce  were  prepared  to 
j o in  her.  T he  s a me  during  the  C r i m e an  war.  This  is  n ot  said  in justification 
of the  general  policy  of the  Austrian  G o v e r n m e n t.  A u s t r ia  has  shown  often

enough  that  to  oppress  a  weaker  n a t i on  is  congenial  work  to  her  rulers.  B ut 
in  the  case  of Poland  t he  instinct  of self-preservation  was  stronger  t h an  t he 
desire  for  new  territory  or  the  habits  of G o v e r n m e n t.  A nd  this  puts  A u s t r ia 
out  of  court  for  the  present. 

As  to  Prussia,  h er  share  of  Poland  is  too  trifling  to  weigh  m u ch  in  t he 
scale.  H er  friend  a nd  ally,  Russia,  h as  m a n a g ed  to  ease  h er  of  n i n e - t e n t hs 
of  what  she  got  during  the  three  partitions.  B ut  what  little  is  left  to  her 
weighs  as  an  i n c u b us  u p on  her.  It  has  chained  h er  to  the  t r i u m p h al  car  of 
Russia,  it  h as  b e en  t he  m e a ns  of  enabling  her  G o v e r n m e n t,  even  in  1863 
and  '64,  to  practise  u n c h a l l e n g e d,  in  Prussian-Poland,  those  b r e a c h es  of 
the  law,  those  infractions  of  individual  liberty,  of  the  right  of  m e e t i n g,  of 
the  liberty  of the  press,  which  were  so  soon  afterwards  to  be  applied  to  the 
rest  of  t he  country;  it  h as  falsified  the  whole  middle-class  Liberal  m o v e 
ment  which,  from  fear  of  risking  the  loss  of  a  few  square  miles  of  land  on 
the  eastern  frontier,  allowed  the  G o v e r n m e nt  to  set  all  law  aside  with  re 
gard  to  the  Poles.  T he  working  m e n,  n ot  only  of  Prussia,  b ut  of  all  Ger 
many,  have  a  greater  interest  t h an  those  of any  other  country  in  t he  restora 
tion  of Poland,  a nd  they  have  shown  in  every  revolutionary  m o v e m e nt  t h at 
they  know  it.  R e s t o r a t i on  of Poland,  to  t h e m,  is  e m a n c i p a t i on  of t h e ir  own 
country  from  R u s s i an  vassalage.  A nd  this,  we  think,  puts  Prussia  out  of 
court,  too.  W h e n e v er  the  working  classes  of R u s s ia  (if there  is  s u ch  a  thing 
in  that  country,  in  the  sense  it  is  u n d e r s t o od  in  W e s t e rn  Europe)  form  a 
political  p r o g r a m m e,  a nd  t h at  p r o g r a m me  c o n t a i ns  the  liberation  of  P o

Sir,—It  is  said  that  to  claim  i n d e p e n d e n ce  for  P o l a nd  is  to  acknowledge  the 
"principle  of nationalities,"  a nd  that  the  principle  of nationalities  is  a  Bon-
30  apartist  invention  concocted  to  prop  up  the  N a p o l e o n ic  d e s p o t i sm  in 

France.  N ow  what  is  this  "principle  of  nationalities"? 

By  the  treaties  of  1815  the  b o u n d a r i es  of  t he  various  States  of  E u r o pe 
were  drawn  merely  to  suit  diplomatic  convenience,  a nd  especially  to  suit 
« 
the  convenience  of  t he  t h en  strongest  c o n t i n e n t al  Power—Russia.  No  ac-

ties  of  the  populations.  T h u s,  Poland  was  divided,  G e r m a ny  was  divided, 
Italy  was  divided,  n ot  to  speak  of the  m a ny  smaller  nationalities  inhabiting 
south-eastern  Europe,  a nd  of which  few  people  at  that  t i me  knew  anything. 
T he  c o n s e q u e n ce  was  that  for  Poland,  G e r m a n y,  a nd  Italy,  t he  very  first 
step  in  every  political  m o v e m e nt  was  to  attempt  the  restoration  of that  na- 
tional  unity  without  which  n a t i o n al  life  was  b ut  a  shadow.  A nd  when,  after 
the  suppression  of  the  revolutionary  attempts  in  Italy  a nd  Spain,  1 8 2 1 - 2 3, 
a nd  again,  after  the  revolution  of July,  1830,  in  F r a n c e,  the  e x t r e me  politi 
cians  of  the  greater  part  of  civilised  E u r o pe  c a me  into  contact  with  each 
other,  and  attempted  to  work  out  a  kind  of c o m m on  p r o g r a m m e,  t he  libera-  10 
tion  a nd  unification  of  the  oppressed  a nd  subdivided  n a t i o ns  b e c a me  a 
watchword  c o m m on  to  all  of them.  So  it  was  again  in  1848,  when  the  n u m 
ber  of oppressed  n a t i o ns  was  increased  by  a  fresh  one,  viz.,  Hungary.  There 
could,  indeed,  be  no  two  opinions  as  to  the  right  of  every  o ne  of  the  great 
n a t i o n al  subdivisions  of  E u r o pe  to  dispose  of  itself,  i n d e p e n d e n t ly  of  its  15= 
neighbours,  in  all  internal  matters,  so  long  as  it  did  not  e n c r o a ch  u p on  the 
liberty  of the  others.  This  right  was,  in  fact,  o ne  of t he  f u n d a m e n t al  condi 
tions  of t he  internal  liberty  of all.  How  could,  for  instance,  G e r m a ny  aspire 
to  liberty  and  unity,  if  at  the  s a me  t i me  she  assisted  Austria  to  keep  Italy 
in  b o n d a g e,  either  directly  or  by  her  vassals?  W h y,  the  total  breaking-up  20-
of  the  A u s t r i an  m o n a r c hy  is  the  very  first  c o n d i t i on  of  the  unification  of 
G e r m a n y! 

< 

This  right  of  the  great  national  subdivisions  of  E u r o pe  to  political  inde 
p e n d e n c e,  acknowledged  as  it  was  by  the  E u r o p e an  democracy,  could  not 
b ut  find  the  s a me  acknowledgment  with  the  working  classes  especially.  It  25. 
was,  in  fact,  n o t h i ng  m o re  t h an  to  recognise  in  other  large  n a t i o n al  bodies 
of u n d o u b t ed  vitality  the  s a me  right  of individual  n a t i o n al  existence  which 
the  working  m en  of each  separate  country  claimed  for  themselves.  But  this 
recognition,  a nd  the  sympathy  with  these  n a t i o n al  aspirations,  were  re 
stricted  to  the  large  a nd  well-defined  historical  n a t i o ns  of E u r o p e;  there  was  30? 
Italy,  Poland,  G e r m a n y,  Hungary.  F r a n c e,  Spain,  England,  Scandinavia, 
were  n e i t h er  subdivided  n or  u n d er  foreign  control,  a nd  therefore  but  indi

Moreover,  no  state  b o u n d a ry  coincides  with  the  n a t u r al  b o u n d a ry  of  n a

Here,  t h e n,  we  perceive  t he  difference  between  the  "principle  of  national

great  E u r o p e an  nations  to  separate  a nd  i n d e p e n d e nt  existence.  T he  "princi

right  of  n a t i o n al  existence  for  the  historic  peoples  of  E u r o p e;  nay,  if  it 
touches  it,  it  is  merely  to  disturb  it.  T he  principle  of nationalities  raises  two 
sorts  of  q u e s t i o n s;  first  of  all,  questions  of  b o u n d a ry  between  these  great 
historic  peoples;  a nd  secondly,  questions  as  to  the  right  to  i n d e p e n d e nt  n a

Shallow  as  the  thing  is,  it  required  cleverer  brains  t h an  Louis  N a p o l e o n 's 
to  invent  it.  T he  principle  of nationalities,  so  far  from  being  a  Bonapartist 
invention  to  favour  a  resurrection  of Poland,  is  n o t h i ng  b ut  a  Russian  inven 
tion  concocted  to  destroy  Poland.  Russia  has  absorbed  t he  greater  part  of  an 
cient  P o l a nd  on  the  plea  of  the  principle  of  nationalities,  as  we  shall  see 
hereafter.  T he  idea  is  m o re  t h an  a  h u n d r ed  years  old,  a nd  R u s s ia  uses  it 
now  every  day.  W h at  is  Panslavism  but  the  application,  by  Russia,  a nd  in

R u t h e n e s,  Slovaks,  Czechs,  a nd  other  r e m n a n ts  of  bygone  Slavonian  peo

extreme  N o r th  of Europe,  u n d er  R u s s i an  protection,  of course.  T he  "cry  of 
anguish"  of the  oppressed  Laplanders  is  raised  very  loud  in  the  R u s s i an  pa-  20.·

a nd  i n d e ed  it  is  a  frightful  oppression,  to  i n d u ce  these  poor  Laplanders  to 
learn  the  civilised  Norwegian  or  Swedish  language,  instead  of  confining 
themselves  to  their  own  barbaric,  half  E s q u i m a ux  idiom!  T he  principle  of 
nationalities,  indeed,  could  be  invented  in  Eastern  E u r o pe  alone,  where  the

braided  e a ch  other  for  having  d o ne  so,  a nd  sold  themselves  a nd  their  coun 
try  to  the  foreigner.  Polish  history,  from  1700  to  1772,  is  n o t h i ng  b ut  a  rec 
ord  of R u s s i an  u s u r p a t i on  of  d o m i n i on  in  Poland,  rendered  possible  by  the 
corruptibility  of  the  nobles.  Russian  soldiers  were  almost  constantly  occu 
pying  the  country,  a nd  the  Kings  of  Poland,  if  not  willing  traitors  them 
selves,  were  placed  m o re  a nd  more  u n d er  the  t h u mb  of the  R u s s i an  Ambas 
sador.  So  well  h ad  this  g a me  succeeded,  a nd  so  long  h ad  it  b e en  played, 
that,  when  P o l a nd  at  last  was  annihilated,  there  was  no  outcry  at  all  in  Eu 
rope,  and,  indeed,  people  were  astonished  at  this  only,  t h at  R u s s ia  should 
have  the  generosity  of  giving  such  a  large  slice  of  the  territory  to  Austria 
a nd  Prussia. 

T he  way  in  which  this  partition  was  brought  about,  is  particularly  inter 
esting.  T h e re  was,  at  t h at  time,  already  an  enlightened  "public  o p i n i o n"  in 
Europe.  A l t h o u gh  the  Times  newspaper  h ad  n ot  yet  b e g un  to  manufacture 
that  article,  there  was  that  kind  of  public  o p i n i on  which  h ad  b e en  created 
by  the  i m m e n se  influence  of  Diderot,  Voltaire,  R o u s s e a u,  a nd  the  other 
F r e n ch  writers  of the  eighteenth  century.  Russia  always  knew  that  it  is  im 
portant  to  have  public  opinion  on  one's  side,  if  possible;  a nd  Russia  took 
care  to  have  it,  too.  T he  Court  of  C a t h e r i ne  II  was  m a de  the  head-quarters 
of the  enlightened  m en  of the  day,  especially  F r e n c h m e n;  the  m o st  enlight 
ened  principle  was  professed  by  the  Empress  a nd  her  Court,  a nd  so  well  did 
she  succeed  in  deceiving  t h em  that  Voltaire  a nd  m a ny  others  sang  the 
praise  of  the  " S e m i r a m is  of  the  N o r t h ,"  a nd  proclaimed  Russia  the  most 
progressive  country  in  the  world,  t he  h o me  of  liberal  principles,  the  cham 
pion  of  religious  toleration. 

Religious  t o l e r a t i o n — t h at  was  the  word  wanted  to  p ut  down  Poland.  Po 
land  h ad  always  b e en  extremely  liberal  in  religious  m a t t e r s;  witness  the 
asylum  t he  Jews  found  there  while  they  were  persecuted  in  all  other  parts 
of  Europe.  T he  greater  portion  of  the  people  in  t he  Eastern  provinces  be 
longed  to  the  G r e ek  faith,  while  the  Poles  proper  were  R o m an  Catholics.  A 
considerable  portion  of  these  G r e ek  Catholics  h ad  b e en  i n d u c e d,  during 
the  sixteenth  century,  to  acknowledge  the  supremacy  of the  Pope,  and  were 
called  U n i t ed  Greeks;  but  a  great  m a ny  c o n t i n u ed  true  to  their  old  Greek 
religion  in  all  respects.  They  were  principally  the  serfs,  their  noble  masters 
being  almost  all  R o m an  Catholics,  they  were  Little  Russians  by  nationality. 
Now,  this  R u s s i an  G o v e r n m e n t,  which  did  n ot  tolerate  at  h o me  any  other 
religion  b ut  t he  Greek,  a nd  p u n i s h ed  apostasy  as  a  c r i m e;  which  was 
conquering  foreign  nations  and  a n n e x i ng  foreign  provinces  right  and  left; 
a nd  which  was  at  that  t i me  engaged  in  riveting  still  firmer  the  fetters  of the 
Russian  serf—this  s a me  Russian  G o v e r n m e nt  c a me  soon  u p on  Poland  in

Greek  Catholics;  in  the  n a me  of t he  principle  of nationalities,  because  the 
inhabitants  of  these  Eastern  provinces  were  Little  Russians,  a nd  ought, 
therefore,  to  be  a n n e x ed  to  Great  Russia;  and  in  the  n a me  of  the  right  of 
revolution  a r m i ng  the  serfs  against  their  masters.  Russia  is  not  at  all  scru 
pulous  in  the  selection  of her  m e a n s.  Talk  a b o ut  a  war  of class  against  class 
as  something  extremely  revolutionary;—why,  Russia  set  such  a  war  on  foot 
in  Poland  nearly  100  years  ago,  a nd  a  fine  specimen  of  a  class-war  it  was, 
when  R u s s i an  soldiers  a nd  Little  Russian  serfs  went  in  c o m p a ny  to  b u rn 
down  the  castles  of the  Polish  lords,  merely  to  prepare  R u s s i an  a n n e x a t i o n, 
which  being  o n ce  accomplished,  the  s a me  R u s s i an  soldiers  p ut  the  serfs 
back  again  u n d er  the  yoke  of  their  lords. 

(Samodergetz  vseckh  Rossyiskikh), 

All  this  was  d o ne  in  the  cause  of religious  toleration,  because  the  princi 
ple  of nationalities  was  not  t h en  fashionable  in  W e s t e rn  Europe.  B ut  it  was 
held  up  before  t he  eyes  of  t he  Little  R u s s i an  p e a s a n ts  at  t he  t i m e,  a nd  h as 
played  an  i m p o r t a nt  part  since  in  Polish  affairs.  T he  first  a nd  foremost  a m 
bition  of R u s s ia  is  the  u n i on  of all  R u s s i an  tribes  u n d er  the  Czar,  who  calls 
himself  the  Autocrat  of  all  the  R u s s i a ns 
and  a m o ng  these  she  includes  W h i te  a nd  Little  Russia.  A nd  in  order  to 
prove  that  h er  a m b i t i on  went  no  further,  she  took  very  good  care,  during 
the  three  partitions,  to  a n n ex  n o ne  b ut  W h i te  a nd  Little  R u s s i an  provinces; 
leaving  the  country  i n h a b i t ed  by  Poles,  a nd  even  a  portion  of Little  Russia 
(Eastern  Galicia)  to  h er  accomplices.  But  how  do  matters  stand  now?  T he 
greater  portion  of  the  provinces  a n n e x ed  in  1793  a nd  1794  by  Austria  a nd 
Prussia  are  now  u n d er  R u s s i an  d o m i n i o n,  u n d er  the  n a me  of the  K i n g d om 
of Poland,  a nd  from  t i me  to  t i me  hopes  are  raised  a m o ng  the  Poles,  that  if 
they  will  only  s u b m it  to  R u s s i an  supremacy,  a nd  r e n o u n ce  all  claims  to  the 
ancient  L i t h u a n i an  provinces,-  they  m ay  expect  a  r e u n i on  of  all  other  Pol 
ish  provinces  a nd  a  restoration  of  Poland,  with  the  R u s s i an  E m p e r or  for  a

T he  following  n o t es  are 
i n t e n d ed  to  c o m m e nt  impartially,  a nd  from  a 
strictly  military  point  of  view,  u p on  the  current  events  of  the  war,  and,  as 
far  as  possible,  to  point  out  their  probable  influence  u p on  i m p e n d i ng  op 
erations. 

T he  locality  where  the  first  decisive  blows  m u st  be  struck  is  the  frontier 
of  Saxony  a nd  B o h e m i a.  T he  war  in  Italy  can  scarcely  lead  to  any  decisive 
results  so  long  as  the  Quadrilateral  r e m a i ns  u n t a k e n,  and  to  take  that  will 
be  rather  a  lengthy  operation.  There  may  be  a  good  deal  of  warlike  action 
in  W e s t e rn  G e r m a n y,  b ut  from  the  strength  of t he  forces  engaged,  it  will  be 
altogether  s u b o r d i n a te  in  its  results  to  the  events  on  t he  B o h e m i an  frontier. 
To  this  n e i g h b o u r h o o d,  therefore,  we  shall,  for  the  present,  exclusively  di 
rect  our  attention. 

In  order  to  j u d ge  of  the  strength  of  the  c o n t e n d i ng  armies  it  will  suffice, 
for  all  practical  purposes,  if we  take  into  account  the  infantry  only,  keeping 
in  m i n d,  however,  t h at  the  strength  of  the  Austrian  cavalry  will  be  to  the 
Prussian  as  three  to  two.  T he  artillery  will  be,  in  b o th  armies,  in  about  the 
same  proportion  as  the  infantry,  say  three  g u ns  per  1,000  m e n. 

T he  Prussian  infantry  consists  of  253  battalions  of  the  line,  8 3½  depot 
battalions,  a nd  116  battalions  of  the  landwehr  (first  levy,  containing  the 
m en  from  27  to  32  years  of  age).  Of  these,  t he  depot  battalions  a nd  land 
wehr  form  the  garrisons  of  the  fortresses,  a nd  are  i n t e n d e d,  besides,  to  act 
against  the  smaller  G e r m an  states,  while  the  line  is  m a s s ed  in  a nd  around 
Saxony  to  oppose  the  Austrian  army  of the  north.  D e d u c t i ng  a b o ut  15  bat 
talions  occupying  Schleswig-Holstein,  a nd  a n o t h er  15  b a t t a l i o n s — t he  late 
garrisons  of  Rastadt,  M a i n z,  a nd  Frankfort,  now  concentrated  at  Wetzlar— 
there  r e m a in  about  220  battalions  for  the  m a in  army.  W i th  cavalry  and  ar-

tillery,  a nd  such  landwehr  as  m ay  be  drawn  from  the  n e i g h b o u r i ng  for 
tresses,  this  army  will  c o n t a in  a b o ut  300,000  m e n,  in  n i ne  army  corps. 

T he  A u s t r i an  army  of t he  n o r th  counts  seven  army  corps,  each  of  which 
is  considerably  stronger  t h an  a  Prussian  o n e.  We  know  very  little  at  present 
of their  composition  and  organisation,  b ut  there  is  every  reason  to  believe 
that  they  form  an  army  of from  320,000  to  350,000  m e n.  N u m e r i c al  superi 
ority,  therefore,  seems  assured  to  the  Austrians.

t he  c o m m a nd 

The  Prussian  army  will  be  u n d er 

t he 
King,—that  is  to  say,  of  a  p a r a de  soldier  of  at  best  very  m e d i o c re  capaci 
ties,  a nd  of  weak,  but  often  obstinate,  character.  He  will  be  s u r r o u n d e d, 
firstly,  by  the  general  staff of the  army,  u n d er  G e n e r al  M o l t k e,  an  excellent 
officer;  secondly,  by  his  "private  military  cabinet,"  c o m p o s ed  of  personal 
favourites;  and,  thirdly,  by  s u ch  other  u n a t t a c h ed  general  officers  as  he 
may  call  to  his  suite.  It  is  impossible  to  invent  a  more  efficient  system  for 
ensuring  defeat  at  the  very  head-quarters  of  an  army.  H e re  is,  at  t he  very 
beginning,  the  n a t u r al  jealousy  between  t he  staff  of  the  army  a nd  t he  C a b 
inet  of the  King,  e a ch  of w h i ch  sections  will  struggle  for  s u p r e me  influence 
and  will  concoct  and  advocate  its  own  pet  p l an  of  operations.  This  alone 
would  render  almost  impossible  all  singleness  of purpose,  all  consistent  ac 
tion.  But  t h en  c o me  t he  i n t e r m i n a b le  councils  of  war,  which  are  u n a v o i d 
able  u n d er  s u ch  circumstances,  a nd  which,  in  n i ne  cases  o ut  of ten,  e nd  in 
the  adoption  of  some  half  m e a s u r e — t he  very  worst  course  in  war.  T he  or 
ders  of  to-day,  in  s u ch  cases,  generally  contradict  those  of  yesterday,  a nd 
when  matters  b e c o me  complicated  or  t h r e a t en  to  go  wrong,  no  orders  at  all 
are  given  out,  a nd  things  take  their  own  course.  "Ordre,  contre-ordre,  désor 
dre, " as  N a p o l e on  used  to  say.  N o b o dy  is  responsible,  because  the  irrespon 
sible  K i ng  takes  all  responsibility  u p on  himself,  and,  therefore,  n o b o dy 
does  anything  u n t il  distinctly  ordered  to  do  so.  T he  c a m p a i gn  of  1806  was 
commanded  in  a  similar  way  by  the  father  of t he  present  King;  t he  defeats 
30  of  J e na  a nd  Auerstädt,  a nd  the  destruction  of  the  whole  Prussian  army 
within  three  weeks,  was  the  c o n s e q u e n c e.  There  is  no  reason  to  suppose 
that  the  present  King  is  superior  in  m e t t le  to  his  father;  a nd  if he  h as  found 
in  C o u nt  Bismarck  a  m an  whose  political  direction  he  can  implicitly  fol 
low,  there  is  no  m an  of  sufficient  standing  in  the  army  to  take  exclusive 
charge,  in  a  similar  way,  of  military  matters. 

The  A u s t r i an  army  is  u n d er  t he  u n c o n d i t i o n al  c o m m a nd  of  G e n e r al 
Benedek,  who  is  an  experienced  officer  a nd  who,  at  least,  knows  his  m i n d. 
The  superiority  of  s u p r e me  c o m m a nd  is  decidedly  on  the  side  of  t he  A u s 
trians. 

w 

The  Prussian  troops  are  subdivided  into  two  "armies;"  the  first,  u n d er 
Prince  Frederick  Charles,  composed  of  t he  1st,  2d,  3d,  4th,  7th,  a nd  8th 

207 

Friedrich  Engels 

corps;  t he  second,  u n d er  t he  Crown  Prince,  of  t he  5th  a nd  6th  corps.  The 
G u a r d s,  forming  the  general  reserve,  will  probably  j o in  the  first  army.  Now 
this  subdivision  n ot  only  breaks  the  u n i ty  of c o m m a n d,  b ut  it  also  induces, 
very  often,  the  two  armies  to  m o ve  on  two  different  lines  of  operation,  to 
m a ke  c o m b i n ed  m o v e m e n t s,  to  lay  their  m u t u al  point  of j u n c t i on  within 
t he  reach  of  t he  e n e m y;  in  other  words,  it  t e n ds  to  keep  t h em  separated 
whereas  they  ought,  as  m u ch  as  possible,  to  keep  together.  T he  Prussians  in 
1806,  a nd  the  Austrians  in  1859,  u n d er  very  similar  circumstances,  fol 
lowed  the  s a me  course,  a nd  were  b e a t e n.  As  to  the  two  c o m m a n d e r s,  the 
Crown  P r i n ce  is  an  u n k n o wn  m a g n i t u de  as  a  soldier;  a nd  Prince  Frederick 
Charles  certainly  did  n ot  show  himself  to  be  a  great  c o m m a n d er  in  the 
D a n i sh  war. 

T he  A u s t r i an  army  has  no  s u ch  subdivision;  the  c o m m a n d e rs  of  the 
army  corps  are  placed  directly  u n d er  G e n e r al  Benedek.  T h ey  are,  therefore, 
again  superior  to  their  o p p o n e n ts  as  far  as  the  organisation  of  the  army 
goes. 

T he  Prussian  soldiers,  especially  t he  m en  of  the  reserve  a nd  s u ch  land-
wehr  m en  as  h ad  to  be  t a k en  to  fill  up  vacancies  in  the  line  (and  there  are 
m a n y)  go  to  war  against  their will;  t he  Austrians,  on  the  contrary,  have  long 
wished  for  a  war  with  Prussia,  a nd  await  with  i m p a t i e n ce  the  order  to  move. 
They  have,  therefore,  also  the  advantage  in  the  morale  of  the  troops. 

Prussia  has  h ad  no  great  war  for  fifty  years;  her  army  is,  on  t he  whole,  a 
peace  army,  with  t he  pedantry  a nd  m a r t i n e t i sm  i n h e r e nt  to  all  peace  ar 
m i e s.  No  d o u bt  a  great  deal  has  b e en  d o ne  latterly,  especially  since  1859, 
to  get  rid  of  this;  b ut  the  habits  of forty  years  are  n ot  so  easily  eradicated, 
a nd  a  great  n u m b er  of  incapable  a nd  p e d a n t ic  m en  m u st  still  be  found, 
particularly  in  the  most  important  places—those  of  the  field  officers.  Now 
the  Austrians  have  b e en  fundamentally  cured  of  this  c o m p l a i nt  by  the  war 
of  1859,  a nd  have  t u r n ed  their  dearly-bought  experience  to  the  very  best 
use.  No  d o u b t,  in  organisation  of  detail,  in  adaptation  for,  a nd  experience 
in,  warfare,  the  Austrians  again  are  superior  to  the  Prussians. 

W i th  the  exception  of  the  Russians  the  Prussians  are  the  only  troops 
whose  n o r m al  formation  for  fighting  is  the  d e ep  close  c o l u m n.  Imagine  the 
eight  c o m p a n i es  of  an  English  battalion  in  a  quarter-distance  c o l u m n,  but 
two  c o m p a n i es  instead  of  one  forming  t he  front,  so  that  four  rows  of  two 
c o m p a n i es  e a ch  form  the  column,  a nd  y ou  have  the  "Prussian  column  of 
attack."  A  better  target  for  rifled  fire-arms  t h an  this  could  not  be  imagined, 
and,  since  rifled  c a n n on  can  throw  a  shell  i n to  it  at  2,000  yards  range,  such 
a  formation  m u st  r e n d er  it  almost  impossible  to  r e a ch  the  e n e my  at  all.  Let 
o ne  single  shell  explode  in  the  m i d st  of this  mass,  a nd  see  whether  that  bat 
talion  is  fit  for  anything  afterwards  on  that  day.

T he  Austrians  h a ve  a d o p t ed  the  loose  o p en  c o l u mn  of the  F r e n c h,  which 
is  scarcely  to  be  called  a  c o l u m n;  it  is  m o re  like  two  or  three  lines  following 
each  other  at  20  or  30  yards  distance,  a nd  is  scarcely,  if anything  m o re  ex 
posed  to  losses  by  artillery  t h an  a  deployed  line.  T he  advantage  of tactical 
formation  is,  again,  on  the  side  of the  A u s t r i a n s. 

5 

Against  all  these  advantages  the  Prussians  have  b ut  two  points  to  set  off. 
Their  commissariat  is  decidedly  better,  a nd  the  troops  will  therefore  be  bet 
ter  fed.  T he  A u s t r i an  commissariat,  like  all  Austrian  administration,  is  o ne 
den  of bribery  a nd  p e c u l a t i on  scarcely  better  t h an  in  Russia.  E v en  now  we 
10  hear  of  the  troops  being  badly  a nd  irregularly  fed;  in  the  field  a nd  in  t he 
fortresses  it  will  be  worse  still,  a nd  the  A u s t r i an  A d m i n i s t r a t i on  m ay  h a p 
pen  to  be  a  m o re  dangerous  e n e my  to  t he  fortresses  in  the  Quadrilateral 
than  the  Italian  artillery.

T he  second  set-off  t he  Prussians  have  is  their  superior  a r m a m e n t.  Al-
though  their  rifled  artillery  is  decidedly  better  t h an  t h at  of the  A u s t r i a n s, 
this  will  m a ke  very  little  difference  in  the  o p en  field.  T he  range,  trajectory, 
and  accuracy  of the  Prussian  a nd  A u s t r i an  rifles  will  be  about  on  a  par;  b ut 
the  Prussians  have  breech-loaders,  a nd  can  deliver  a  steady  well-aimed  fire 
in  the  ranks  at  least  four  t i m es  in  a  m i n u t e.  T he  i m m e n se  superiority  of 
this  a rm  has  b e en  proved  in  t he  D a n i sh war,  a nd  there  is  no  d o u bt  t he  A u s 
trians  will  experience  it  in  a  far  higher  degree.  If they,  as  it  is  said  B e n e d ek 
has  instructed  t h em  to  do,  will  n ot  lose  m u ch  t i me  with  firing,  b ut  go  at  t he 
enemy  at  o n ce  with  the  bayonet,  they  will  have  e n o r m o us  losses.  In  t he 
Danish  war,  the  loss  of  the  Prussians  was  never  m o re  t h an  o ne  fourth, 
sometimes  only  o ne  t e n t h,  of  that  of  the  D a n e s;  and,  as  a  military  corre 
spondent  of  the  Times  a  short  t i me  ago  very  correctly  p o i n t ed  out,  t he 
Danes  were  almost  everywhere  b e a t en  by  a  minority  of  troops  actually  en 
gaged. 

Still,  in  spite  of the  n e e d le  gun,  the  odds  are  against  the  Prussians;  a nd  if 
they  refuse  to  be  b e a t en  in  t he  first  great  battle  by  the  superior  leadership, 
organisation,  tactical  formation,  a nd  morale  of  t he  Austrians,  a nd  last,  n ot 
least,  by  their  own  c o m m a n d e r s,  t h en  they  m u st  certainly  be  of  a  different 
mettle  from  t h at  of  which  a  peace  army  of  50  years'  standing  m ay  be  ex 
pected  to  b e.

People  begin  to  grow  i m p a t i e nt  at  the  apparent  inactivity  of  the  two  great 
armies  on  the  B o h e m i an  frontier.  But  there  are  plenty  of  reasons  for  this 
delay.  Both  the  Austrians  a nd  the  Prussians  are  perfectly  aware  of  the  im 
p o r t a n ce  of  the  i m p e n d i ng  collision,  which  m ay  decide  the  result  of  the 
whole  campaign.  B o th  are  hurrying  up  to  the  front  whatever  m en  they  can 
lay  their  h a n ds  o n;  t he  A u s t r i a ns  from  their  new  formations  (the  fourth  and 
fifth  battalions  of the  infantry  regiments),  the  Prussians  from  t he  landwehr, 
which  at  first  was  i n t e n d ed  for  garrison  duty  only. 

5 

At  the  s a me  time,  there  appears  to  be  on  either  side  an  a t t e m pt  to  out-  10 

manoeuvre  the  opposing  army,  a nd  to  enter  u p on  the  c a m p a i gn  u n d er  the 
m o st  favourable  strategical  conditions.  To  u n d e r s t a nd  this,  we  shall  have  to 
look  at  t he  m ap  a nd  e x a m i ne  the  country  in  which  these  armies  are  placed. 
Taking  it  for  granted  t h at  Berlin  and  V i e n na  are  the  n o r m al  points  of re 
treat  of  the  two  armies,  a nd  that  therefore  t he  A u s t r i a ns  will  a im  at  the  15 
conquest  of  Berlin  a nd  the  Prussians  at  t h at  of  V i e n n a,  there  are  three 
routes  by  which  they  m i g ht  operate.  A  large  a r my  requires  a  certain  extent 
of  country  from  the  resources  of  which  it  h as  to  live  on  t he  m a r c h,  and  is 
compelled,  in  order  to  m o ve  quickly,  to  m a r ch  in  several  c o l u m ns  on  as 
m a ny  parallel  roads;  its  front  will,  therefore,  be  extended  on  a  line  which  20 
m ay  vary  between,  say  sixty  a nd  sixteen  miles,  according  to  the  proximity 
of t he  e n e my  and  t he  distance  of the  roads  from  each  other.  This  will  have 
to  be  kept  in  m i n d. 

T he  first  route  would  be  on  the  left  b a nk  of  the  Elbe  a nd  M o l d a u,  by 
Leipsic  a nd  Prague.  It  is  evident  that  on  this  r o u te  e a ch  of t he  belligerents  25 
: 
would  have  to  cross  t he  river  twice,  the  second  t i me  in  t he  face  of the  en- 
emy.  Supposing  either  army  to  attempt  to  turn,  by  this  r o u t e,  t he  flank  of 
its  opponent,  the  latter,  having  t he  shorter,  b e c a u se  straighter  road,  could 
still  anticipate  t he  turning  force  on  the  line  of the  river,  a nd  if successful  in 
repelling  it,  could  m a r ch  straight  u p on  the  e n e m y 's  capital.  This  route,  30 
equally  disadvantageous  to  b o th  parties,  m ay  therefore  be  dismissed  from 
consideration. 

T he  second  r o u te  is  on  the  right  b a nk  of the  Elbe,  between  it  and  the  Su-
detic  m o u n t a in  c h a in  which  divides  Silesia  from  B o h e m ia  a nd  Moravia. 
T h is  is  almost  on  t he  straight  line  from  Berlin  to  V i e n n a;  t he  portion  now  35 
lying  between  the  two  armies  is  m a r k ed  o ut  by  the  railway  from  L o b au  to 
P a r d u b i t z.  This  railway  passes  through  that  portion  of  B o h e m ia  which  is 

210 

Notes on the War (1866) •  II 

b o u n d ed  by  the  Elbe  to  the  s o u th  a nd  west,  a nd  the  m o u n t a i ns  to  the 
north-east.  It  has  plenty  of good  roads,  and  if the  two  armies  were  to  m a r ch 
straight  at  e a ch  other,  here  would  be  the  point  of  collision. 

T he  third  r o u te  is  t h at  by  Breslau,  a nd  t h e n ce  across  the  Sudetic  chain. 
This  chain,  of no  considerable  elevation,  on  the  M o r a v i an  frontier,  where  it 
is  crossed  by  several  good  roads,  rises  to  greater  elevation  a nd  abruptness 
in  the  Riesengebirge,  which  forms  the  b o u n d a ry  of  B o h e m i a.  H e re  there 
are  b ut  few  roads  across;  in  fact,  between  T r a u t e n au  a nd  Reichenberg,  a 
distance  of  forty  miles,  t he  whole  n o r t h - e a s t e rn  p o r t i on  of t he  range  is  n ot 
traversed  by  a  single  military  road.  T he  only  road  in  existence  there,  t h at 
from  Hirschberg  to  the  valley  of  t he  Iser,  stops  short  at  the  Austrian  fron 
tier.  It  follows,  then,  t h at  this  whole  barrier  of forty  miles  in  length,  is  i m 
passable,  at  least  for  a  large  army,  with  its  i n n u m e r a b le  i m p e d i m e n t a,  a nd 
that  an  advance  u p on  or  by  Breslau  m u st  pass  the  m o u n t a i ns  to  the  south 
west  of  t he  Riesengebirge. 

Now,  what  are  the  relative  positions  of  the  two  armies,  with  regard  to 

their  c o m m u n i c a t i o n s,  if  engaged  on  this  route? 

T he  Prussians,  by  advancing  due  s o u th  from  Breslau,  lay  o p en  their  com 
munications  with  Berlin.  T he  Austrians  might,  if  strong  e n o u gh  to  com 
mand  the  almost  absolute  certainty  of victory,  leave  t h em  to  advance  as  far 
as  t he  i n t r e n c h ed  c a mp  of  O l m u t z,  w h i ch  would  stop  t h e m,  while  they 
themselves  could  m a r ch  u p on  Berlin,  trusting  to  re-open  any  temporarily-
interrupted  c o m m u n i c a t i o ns  by  a  decisive  victory;  or  they  might  m e et  t he 
Prussian  c o l u m ns  singly  as  they  d e b o u ch  from  the  m o u n t a i n s,  and,  if  suc 
cessful,  drive  t h em  back  u p on  Glogau  a nd  Posen,  whereby  Berlin  a nd  the 
greater  portion  of  the  Prussian  states  would  be  at  their  mercy.  T h us  an  ad 
vance  by  Breslau  would  be  advisable  for  t he  Prussians  in  case  of a  great  n u 
merical  superiority  only. 

T he  A u s t r i a ns  are  in  a  far  different  position.  They  have  the  advantage 
that  the  bulk  of  the  m o n a r c hy  lies  south-east  of  Breslau;,  that  is,  in  the  di 
rect prolongation  of  a  line  drawn  from  Berlin  to  Breslau.  Having  fortified  t he 
northern  b a nk  of the  D a n u be  n e ar  V i e n n a,  so  as  to  shelter  t he  capital  from 
a  surprise,  they, m a y,  temporarily  a nd  even  for  a  length  of  t i m e,  sacrifice 
their  direct  c o m m u n i c a t i on  with  V i e n n a,  and  draw  their  supplies  of  m en 
and  stores  from  Hungary.  They  can,  therefore,  with  e q u al  safety  operate  by 
way  of  L o b au  a nd  by  way  of  Breslau,  to  the  n o r th  or  to  the  s o u th  of  t he 
hills;  they  h a ve  far  greater  freedom  in  manoeuvring  t h an  their  o p p o n e n t s. 

T he  Prussians,  moreover,  have  further  reasons  to  be  cautious.  F r om  t he 
northern  frontier  of B o h e m i a,  the  distance  to  Berlin  is  n ot  m u ch  m o re  t h an 
half of that  to  V i e n n a;  Berlin  is  so  m u ch  m o re  exposed.  V i e n na  is  sheltered 
by  the  D a n u b e,  b e h i nd  which  a  b e a t en  a r my  c an  find  protection;  by  t he 

211 

Friedrich  Engels 

fortifications  erected  to  the  north  of that  river;  a nd  by  t he  i n t r e n c h ed  c a mp 
of O l m u t z,  which  t he  Prussians  could  n ot  pass  u n n o t i c ed  with  i m p u n i t y,  if 
the  m a ss  of  the  A u s t r i an  army,  after  a  defeat,  were  to  take  up  a  position 
there.  Berlin  has  no  protection  of  any  kind,  except  the  a r my  in  t he  field. 
U n d er  these  circumstances,  and  those  detailed  in  our  first  n u m b e r,  t he  part 
destined  for  the  Prussians  appears  to  be  clearly  m a r k ed  out  as  a  defensive 
o n e. 

5 

T he  s a me  series  of circumstances,  and  strong  political  necessity  besides, 
almost  compels  Austria  to  act  on  the  offensive.  A  single  victory  m ay  ensure 
to  her  great  results,  while  her  defeat  would  n ot  break  h er  power  of  resis-  10 
tance. 

T he  strategical  plan  of  the  c a m p a i gn  in  its  f u n d a m e n t al  features  is  nec 
essarily  very  simple.  Whichever  of the  two  attacks  first,  he  has  only  this  al 
ternative:  either  a  false  attack  north-west  of  the  Riesengebirge,  a nd  the  true 
attack  south-east  of it,  or  vice  versa.  T he  forty-mile  barrier  is  the  decisive  15 
feature  of the  seat  of war,  and  round  it  the  armies  m u st  gravitate.  We  shall 
hear  of  fighting  at  b o th  its  extremities,  a nd  a  very  few  days  afterwards  will 
clear  up  t he  direction  of  the  true  attack,  a nd  probably  the  fate  of  the  first 
campaign.  Yet,  with  two  s u ch  unwieldy  armies  opposed  to  e a ch  other,  we 
feel  inclined  to  think  that  t he  most  direct  route  is  the  safest,  a nd  that  the  20  · 
difficulty  a nd  danger  of m o v i ng  s u ch  large  b o d i es  of  troops  in  separate  co 
l u m ns  on  different  roads  through  a  difficult  m o u n t a in  country,  will  almost 
naturally  draw  b o th  opposing  armies  on  the  route  L o b a u - P a r d u b i t z. 

T he  actual  m o v e m e n ts  which  have  t a k en  place  are  as  follows:—The 
Prussians,  in  the  first  week  of J u n e,  m a s s ed  their  army  of Saxony  along  the  25  j 
Saxon  frontier,  from  Zeitz  to  Görlitz,  a nd  their  Silesian  a r my  from  Hirsch 
berg  to  N e i s s e.  By  t he  10th  J u ne  they  drew  n e a r er  together,  having  their 
right  wing  on  the  Elbe  n e ar  Torgau,  a nd  their  extreme  left  n e ar  W a l d e n 
burg.  F r om  the  12th  to  the  16th,  the  army  of  Silesia,  now  consisting  of  the 
1st,  5th,  a nd  6th  corps  a nd  the  G u a r d s,  were  again  e x t e n d ed  to  the  east, 
this  t i me  as  far  as  Ratibor,  that  is  to  say,  into  the  extreme  south-eastern 
corner  of  Silesia.  This  looks  like  a  feint,  especially  t he  parading  of  the 
G u a r d s,  which  are  supposed  to  be  always  with  the  m a in  army.  If it  be  more 
t h an  a  feint,  or  if m e a s u r es  have  not  b e en  t a k en  to  m o ve  these  four  corps 
back  towards  Görlitz  at  the  shortest  n o t i ce  a nd  in  the  shortest  time,  then 
this  massing  of  m o re  t h an  120,000  m en  in  a  r e m o te  corner  is  a  palpable 
m i s t a k e;  they  m ay  be  cut  off  from  all  possibility  of  retreat  a nd  certainly 
from  all  c o n n e c t i on  with  the  r e m a i n d er  of  t he  army.

head-quarters  were  to  be  shifted  to  T r u b a u,  on  the  frontier  between  Mora

not  look  exceedingly  like  a  canard  sent  on  to  L o n d on  with  t he  i n t e n t i on  of 
being  t h e n ce  telegraphed  to  t he  Prussian  head-quarters  in  order  to  mislead 
them.  A  general  who  acts  with  such  secrecy  as  Benedek,  a nd  who  has  s u ch 
objections  to  newspaper  correspondents,  is  n ot  likely  to  inform  t h em  on  t he 
19th  where  his  head-quarters  will  be  on  t he  21st,  unless  he  has  his  reasons 
for  it.

Before  concluding,  we  m ay  be  allowed  to  cast  a  glance  at  the  operations 
in  North-western  G e r m a n y.  T he  Prussians  h ad  m o re  troops  here  t h an  was 
at  first  known.  T h ey  h ad  15  battalions  disposable  in  Holstein,  12 
in 
M i n d e n,  a nd  18  in  Wetzlar.  By  rapid  concentric  moves,  during  which  t he 
troops  showed  a  q u i te  u n e x p e c t ed  capability  of supporting  forced  m a r c h e s, 
they  took  possession  in  two  days  of all  t he  country  n o r th  of a  line  from  Co-
blentz  to  Eisenach,  a nd  of  every  line  of  c o m m u n i c a t i on  between  the  east 
ern  a nd  western  provinces  of  the  kingdom.  T he  Hessian  troops,  a b o ut 
7,000  strong,  m a n a g ed  to  escape,  b ut  the  H a n o v e r i a n s,  10,000  or  12,000, 
had  their  direct  line  of retreat  towards  Frankfort  cut  off,  a nd  already  on  the 
17th  the  rest  of  the  7th  Prussian  army  corps,  12  battalions,  together  with 
the  two  Coburg  battalions,  arrived  in  E i s e n a ch  from  t he  E l b e.  T h us  t he 
Hanoverians  appear  to  be  h e m m ed  in  on  all  sides,  a nd  could  escape  only 
by  a  miracle  of stupidity  on  the  part  of the  Prussians.  As  soon  as  their  fate 
will  be  settled,  a  force  of 50  Prussian  battalions  will  be  available  against  t he 
25  Federal  a r my  which  Prince  A l e x a n d er  of  D a r m s t a dt  is  forming  at  Frank 
fort,  and  which  will  consist  of a b o ut  23,000  Wurtembergers,  10,000  D a r m-
stadters,  6,000  N a s s a u e r s,  13,000  B a d e n e rs  (only  mobilising  now),  7,000 
Hessians,  a nd  12,000  Austrians,  now  on  t he  r o ad  from  Salzburg;  in  all 
about  65,000  m e n,  who  m ay  be  possibly  reinforced  by  from  10,000  to 
30  20,000  Bavarians.  A b o ut  60,000  m en  of these  are  now  reported  as  already 
concentrated  at  Frankfort,  a nd  Prince  A l e x a n d er  has  ventured  u p on  a  for 
ward  move  by  re-occupying  Glessen  on  t he  22d.  This,  however,  is  of  no 
consequence.  T he  Prussians  will  n ot  advance  against  h im  u n t il  they  are 
well  concentrated,  a nd  t h e n,  with  70,000  m en  of  all  arms,  a nd  their  supe-

T he  first  great  battle  has  b e en  fought,  not  in  B o h e m i a,  b ut  in  Italy,  a nd  the 
Quadrilateral  has  again  given  the  Italians  a  lesson  in  strategy.  T he  strength 
of  this  famous  position,  as  indeed  of  all  fortified  positions  of  any  value, 
consists,  n ot  so  m u ch  in  the  high  defensive  capabilities  of  its  four  for 
tresses,  b ut  in  their  being  so  grouped  in  a  country  with  strongly-marked 
military  features  that  the  attacking  force  is  almost  always  i n d u c e d,  a nd  of 
t en  compelled,  to  divide  itself  and  attack  on  two  different  points,  while  the 
defending  force  can  send  its  whole  c o m b i n ed  strength  against  o ne  of  these 
attacks,  crush  it  by  superior  n u m b e r s,  a nd  t h en  t u rn  against  t he  other.  The 
Italian  a r my  has  been  i n d u c ed  to  c o m m it  this  fault.  T he  King  stood  with 
eleven  divisions  on  t he  M i n c i o,  while  Cialdini  with  five  divisions  faced  the 
Lower  Po,  n e ar  P o n te  Lagoscuro  a nd  Polesella.  An  Italian  division  counts 
17  battalions  of  700  m en  each;  consequently,  Victor  E m m a n u el  would 
have,  with  cavalry  a nd  artillery,  at  least  120,000  or  125,000  m e n,  a nd  Cial 
d i ni  about  half  that  n u m b e r.  While  the  King  crossed  the  M i n c io  on  the 
23d,  Cialdini  was  to  cross  the  Lower  Po  a nd  act  u p on  the  rear  of the  Austri 
a n s;  b ut  up  to  t he  m o m e nt  we  write,  no  certain  news  have  arrived  of  this 
latter  m o v e m e nt  having  b e en  effected.  At  all  events,  the  60,000  m en  whose 
presence  might,  and  probably  would,  have  t u r n ed  the  scale  on  Sunday  last 
at  Custozza,  cannot,  so  far,  have  o b t a i n ed  any  advantage  at  all  c o m m e n s u 
rate  to  the  loss  of  a  great  battle. 

T he  Lake  of  G a r da  lies  encased  between  two  spurs  of  the  Alps,  forming, 
to  the  south  of  it,  two  clusters  of hills,  between  which  the  M i n c io  forces  its 
way  towards  the  lagoons  of M a n t u a.  B o th  of these  groups  form  strong  mili 
tary  positions;  their  slopes  towards  the  s o u th  overlook  the  L o m b a rd  plain, 
a nd  c o m m a nd  it  within  gun-range.  T h ey  are  well  k n o wn  in  military  history. 
T he  western  group,  between  Peschiera  a nd  L o n a t o,  was  the  scene  of  the 
battles  of  Castiglione  a nd  L o n a to  in  1797,  a nd  of  Solferino  in  1859;  the 
eastern  group,  between  Peschiera  a nd  Verona,  was  contested  during  three  30| 
days  in  1848,  a nd  again  in  the  battle  of  last  Sunday. 

This  eastern  group  of  hills  slopes  down  on  o ne  side  towards  the  Mincio, 

where  it  e n ds  in  the  p l a in  at  Valleggio;  on  t he  other  side,  in  a  long  arc,  fac 
ing  south-east,  towards  the  Adige,  which  it  reaches  at  Bussolengo.  It  is  di 
vided,  from  n o r th  to  south,  in  two  a b o ut  e q u al  portions  by  a  deep  ravine,  4 
t h r o u gh  which  flows  the  rivulet  T i o n e;  so  t h at  a  force  advancing  from  the 
M i n c io  will  have  first  to  force  the  passage  of t he  river,  a nd  i m m e d i a t e ly  af-

terwards  find  itself  again  arrested  by  this  ravine.  On  t he  edge  of  t he  slope, 

facing  t he  plain,  a nd  east  of  t he  ravine,  are  t he  following  villages:—Cus-

tozza,  on  t he  s o u t h e rn  extremity;  further  north, 

in  succession,  S o m ma 

C a m p a g n a,  Sona,  a nd  S a n ta  G i u s t i n a.  T he  railway  from  P e s c h i e ra  to  Ver-

In  1848,  after  t he  P i e d m o n t e se  h ad  t a k en  Peschiera,  they  b l o c k a d ed 

M a n t ua  a nd  e x t e n d ed  their  army  from  b e y o nd  t h at  place  to  Rivoli,  on  the 

Lake  of  G a r d a,  their  centre  occupying  t he  hills  in  q u e s t i o n.  On  the  23d

are  rather  contradictory;  but,  with  t he  assistance  of  t h o se  from  t he  o t h er 

side,  we  get  a  pretty  clear  insight  i n to  t he  c i r c u m s t a n c es  u n d er  w h i ch  it  was 

fought.  Victor  E m m a n u el  i n t e n d ed  his  1st  corps  ( G e n e r al  D u r a n d o,  four 

divisions  or  68  battalions),  to  take  up  a  position  between  Peschiera  a nd 

Verona,  so  as  to  be  able  to  cover  a  siege  of t he  former  place.  This  p o s i t i on 

20  must,  of  course,  be  S o na  a nd  S o m ma  C a m p a g n a.  T he  2d  corps  ( G e n e r al 

Cucchiari,  three  divisions  or  51  battalions)  a nd  3d  corps  ( G e n e r al  Delia 

Rocca,  of  t he  s a me  strength  as  t he  second)  were  to  cross  t he  M i n c io  at  t he 

same  t i m e,  to  cover  t he  o p e r a t i o ns  of  t he  1st.  T he  1st  corps  m u st  have 

crossed  n e ar  or  s o u th  of  Salionce,  a nd  t a k en  t he  road  of  t he  hills  at  o n c e;

the  2d  seems  to  have  crossed  at  Valleggio,  a nd  t he  3d  at  G o i t o,  a nd  ad­

vanced  in  t he  plain.  T h is  took  place  on  Saturday  the  23d.  T he  A u s t r i an  bri­

the  anniversary  of  Solferino, 

t he  whole  of  t he 

Austrian  army  d e b o u c h ed  from  V e r o na  to  m e et  the  e n e m y.  T h ey  appear  to 

30  have  arrived  in  t i me  to  occupy  the  heights  of  S o na  a nd  S o m ma  C a m p a g n a,

the  s o u t h e rn  extremity  t he  two  corps  in  t he  p l a in  could  co-operate  with  t he 

1st  I t a l i an  corps  in  the  hills,  a nd  t h us  Custozza  fell  i n to  their  h a n d s.  G r a d-

Austrians  would  send  troops  to  m e et  t h e m.  T h us  t he  front  lines  of t he  two 

armies,  w h i ch  were  originally 

facing  east  a nd  west  respectively,  would 

wheel  r o u nd  a  quarter  circle,  the  Austrians  facing  s o u th  a nd  t he  Italians 

40  north.  But,  as  t he  hills  retreat  from  C u s t o z za  to  the  north-east,  this  flank 

m o v e m e nt  of  t he  I t a l i an  2d  a nd  3d  corps  could  n ot  i m m e d i a t e ly  affect  t he

position  of their  1st  corps  in  t he  hills,  because  it  could  n ot  be  e x t e n d ed  far 
e n o u gh  without  d a n g er  to  the  flanking  troops  themselves.  T h us  the  Austri 
ans  appear  merely  to  have  occupied  the  2d  and  3d  corps  by  troops  suffi 
cient  to  break  their  first  i m p e t u s,  while  they  l a u n c h ed  every  available  m an

fectly  successful;  the  first  corps  was  repulsed,  after  a  gallant  struggle,  and  at 
last  Custozza  was  stormed  by  the  Austrians.  By  this,  the  Italian  right  wing 
advanced  east  a nd  north-east  b e y o nd  Custozza,  appears  to  have  b e en  seri 
ously  e n d a n g e r e d;  consequently  a  new  struggle  for  t he  village  took  place, 
during  which  t he  lost  c o n n e c t i on  m u st  have  b e en  restored,  a nd  t he  Aus-

We  give  this  sketch  of the  battle,  not  as  a  historical  account—for  which 
every  detail  is  as  yet  w a n t i n g — b ut  merely  as  an  attempt,  m ap  in  h a n d,  to 
reconcile  t he  various  telegrams  relating  to  it  a m o n g st  e a ch  other,  a nd  with  15  * 
military  c o m m on  sense;  and  if the  telegrams  were  anything  like  correct  and 
complete,  we  feel  confident  that  t he  general  outline  of t he  battle  would  ap 
pear  to  be  n ot  very  different  from  what  we  have  stated. 

T he  Austrians  lost  a b o ut  600  prisoners,  t he  Italians  2,000,  a nd  a  few 
guns.  This  shows  the  battle  to  have  b e en  a  defeat,  b ut  no  disaster.  T he  for-  20. 
ces  m u st  have  b e en  pretty  equally  m a t c h e d,  although  it  is  very  probable 
t h at  the  A u s t r i a ns  h ad  less  troops  u n d er  fire  t h an  their  o p p o n e n t s.  T he  Ital 
ians  have  every  reason  to  congratulate  themselves  that  they  were  n ot  driven 
back  into  t he  M i n c i o;  the  position  of  the  1st  corps  between  t h at  river  and 
the  ravine,  on  a  strip  of land  between  two  a nd  four  miles  wide,  a nd  a  supe-  25 J 
rior  e n e my  in  front,  m u st  have  b e en  one  of  considerable  danger.  It  was  un 
d o u b t e d ly  a  m i s t a ke  to  send  the  m a in  b o dy  of  the  troops  i n to  the  plain; 
while  the  c o m m a n d i ng  heights,  the  decisive  points,  were  neglected;  b ut  the 
greatest  m i s t a ke  was,  as  we  pointed  out  before,  to  divide  the  army,  to  leave 
Cialdini  with  60,000  m en  on  the  Lower  Po,  a nd  to  attack  with  t he  remain-  30  ' 
der  alone.  Cialdini  could  h a ve  contributed  to  a  victory  before  Verona,  and 
then,  m a r c h i ng  back  to  the  Lower  Po,  have  effected  his  passage  m u ch  more 
easily,  if  this  c o m b i n ed  m a n œ u v re  was  to  be  insisted  u p on  at  all  hazards. 
As  it  is,  he  seems  no  further  advanced  t h an  on  the  first  day,  a nd  m ay  now 
have  to  m e et  stronger  forces  t h an  h i t h e r t o.  T he  Italians  ought,  by  this  time,  35 
to  know  t h at  they  have  a  very  tough  o p p o n e nt  to  deal  with.  At  Solferino, 
Benedek,  with  26,000  Austrians,  h e ld  the  whole  P i e d m o n t e se  a r my  of fully 
d o u b le  t h at  n u m b er  at  bay  for  the  whole  day,  u n t il  he  was  ordered  to  re 
treat  in  c o n s e q u e n ce  of  the  defeat  of  the  other  corps  by  t he  F r e n c h.  That 
P i e d m o n t e se  army  was  m u ch  superior  to  t he  p r e s e nt  Italian  army;  it  was 
better  schooled,  m o re  h o m o g e n e o u s,  a nd  better  officered.  T he  present

Suppose  a  y o u ng  Prussian  ensign  or  cornet,  u n d er  e x a m i n a t i on  for  a  lieu 
tenancy,  to  be  asked  what  would  be  the  safest  plan  for  a  Prussian  a r my  to 
invade  B o h e m i a?  Suppose  our  y o u ng  officer  were  to  answer,—"Your  best 
15  way  will  be  to  divide  your  troops  into  two  about  equal  bodies,  to  send  one 
round  by  t he  east  of  the  Riesengebirge,  the  other  to  the  west,  a nd  effect 
their  j u n c t i on  in  G i t s c h i n ."  W h at  would  t he  e x a m i n i ng  officer  say  to  this? 
He  would  inform  the  y o u ng  g e n t l e m an  that  this  plan  sinned  against  the 
two  very  first  laws  of  strategy:—Firstly,  never  to  divide  your  troops  so  that 
they  c a n n ot  support  e a ch  other,  b ut  to  keep  t h em  well  together;  and,  se 
condly,  in  case  of an  advance  on  different  roads,  to  effect  t he j u n c t i on  of the 
different  c o l u m ns  at  a  point  which  is  n ot  within  reach  of  the  e n e m y;  that, 
therefore,  t he  p l an  proposed  was  t he  very  worst  of  all;  t h at  it  could  only  be 
taken  into  consideration  at  all  in  case  B o h e m ia  was  quite  u n o c c u p i ed  by 
25  hostile  troops;  a nd  that,  consequently,  an  officer  proposing  such  a  p l an  of 

20 

campaign  was  n ot  fit  to  hold  even  a  l i e u t e n a n t 's  commission. 

Yet,  this  is  t he  very  plan  which  the  wise  a nd  learned  staff of the  Prussian 
army  have  adopted.  It  is  almost  incredible;  b ut  it  is  so.  T he  m i s t a ke  for 
which  the  Italians  h ad  to  suffer  at  Custozza,  has  b e en  again  c o m m i t t ed  by 
the  Prussians,  a nd  u n d er  circumstances  which  m a de  it  ten-fold  worse.  T he 
Italians  knew  at  least  that,  with  ten  divisions,  they  would  be  numerically 
superior  to  the  enemy.  T he  Prussians  m u st  have  k n o wn  t h at  if  they  kept 
their  n i ne  corps  together  they  would  be  at  best  barely  on  a  par,  as  far  as 
numbers  went,  with  Benedek's  eight  corps;  a nd  that  by  dividing  their 
troops  they  exposed  the  two  armies  to  t he  almost  certain  fate  of  being 
crushed  in  succession  by  superior  n u m b e r s.  It  would  be  completely  inexpli-

cable  how  s u ch  a  plan  could  ever  -be  discussed,  m u ch  less  adopted,  by  a 
body  of s u ch  u n q u e s t i o n a b ly  capable  officers  as  form  the  Prussian  staff—if 
it  was  not  for  the  fact  of  King  William  being  in  chief  c o m m a n d.  But  no 
body  could  possibly  expect  that  the  fatal  c o n s e q u e n c es  of kings  a nd  princes 
taking  high  c o m m a nd  would  c o me  out  so  soon  a nd  so  strong.  T he  Prus 
sians  are  now  fighting,  in  Bohemia,  a  life-and-death  struggle.  If  the  junc 
tion  of the  two  armies  at  or  about  G i t s c h in  is  prevented,  if each  of t he  two, 
being  beaten,  h as  to  retire  o ut  of  Bohemia,  and,  by  retiring,  to  get  further 
away  again  from  the  other,  t h en  the  c a m p a i gn  m ay  be  said  to  be  virtually 
over.  T h en  B e n e d ek  m ay  leave  the  army  of  the  Crown  Prince  unnoticed  10 
while  it  retires  towards  Breslau,  a nd  follow  u p,  with  all  his  forces,  the  army 
of  Prince  Frederic  Charles,  which  can  hardly  escape  u t t er  destruction. 

T he  question  is,  Will  this  j u n c t i on  have  b e en  prevented?  Up  to  the  mo 
m e nt  we  write  we  have  no  news  of  events  later  t h an  Friday  evening,  the 
29th.  T he  Prussians,  b e a t en  o ut  of  Gitschin  (the  n a me  of the  place,  in  Bo-  15 
h e m i a n,  is  spelt  Jicin)  on  the  28th  by  G e n e r al  Edelsheim,  claim  to  have 
stormed  the  town  again  on  the  29th,  and  this  is  the  last  information  we  pos 
sess.  T he j u n c t i on  was  n ot  t h en  effected;  at  least  four  A u s t r i an  a nd  parts  of 
the  Saxon  army  corps  h ad  t h en  b e en  engaged  against  a b o ut  five  or  six  Prus 
sian  corps. 

20 

T he  various  c o l u m ns  of the  army  of the  Crown  Prince,  as  they  descended 
into  the  valley  on  the  B o h e m i an  side  of t he  hills,  were  m et  by  the  Austrians 
at  favourable  points  where  the  valley,  widening  out,  allowed  t h em  to  offer  a 
larger  front  to  the  Prussian  columns,  a nd  to  a t t e m pt  to  prevent  t h em  from 
deploying;  while  the  Prussians  would  send  troops,  wherever  practicable,  25;-
t h r o u gh  the  lateral  valleys,  to  take  their  o p p o n e n ts  in  flank  a nd  rear.  This  is 
always  the  case  in  m o u n t a in  warfare,  a nd  accounts  for  t he  great  n u m b er  of 
prisoners  that  are  always  m a de  u n d er  s u ch  circumstances.  On  the  other 
side,  the  armies  of  Prince  Frederick  Charles  a nd  Herwarth  von  Bittenfeld 
appear  to  h a ve  got  through  the  passes  almost  u n o p p o s e d;  the  first  engage-  30: 
m e n ts  took  place  on  the  line  of  the  Iser  river,  that  is  almost  midway  be 
tween  the  starting  points  of the  two  armies.  It  would  be  idle  to  try  to  disen 
tangle  a nd  bring  into  h a r m o ny  the  fearfully  contradictory,  a nd  often  totally 
u n a u t h e n t i c a t e d,  telegrams  which  have  c o me  to  h a nd  these  last  three  or 
four  days.

T he  fighting  has  b e en  necessarily  very  m u ch  c h e q u e r ed  in  its  results;  as 
new  forces  c a me  u p,  victory  favoured  first  o ne  a nd  t h en  t he  other  side.  Up 
to  Friday,  however,  the  general  result  appears  to  have  b e e n,  so  far,  in  favour 
of  t he  Prussians.  If  they  m a i n t a i n ed  themselves  in  Gitschin,  no  doubt  the 
j u n c t i on  was  effected  on  Saturday  or  Sunday,  a nd 
t h en  their  greatest 
danger  would  be  passed.  The  final  fight  for  t he j u n c t i on  would  probably  be 

218 

Notes on the War (1866)  ·  IV 

fought  with  concentrated  masses  on  b o th  sides,  and  decide  the  c a m p a i gn 
for  s o me  time,  at  least.  If  the  Prussians  were  victorious,  they  would  be  at 
once  out  of  all  their  self-begotten  difficulties,  b ut  they  m i g ht  have  o b t a i n ed 
the  same,  a nd  even  greater,  advantages  without  exposing  themselves  to 
such  unnecessary  dangers. 

T he  fighting  appears  to  have  b e en  severe.  T he  very  first  A u s t r i an  brigade 
which  m et  the  Prussians  in  battle,  was  the  "black  a nd  yellow"  brigade, 
which,  in  Schleswig,  stormed  the  Königsberg,  n e ar  Oberselk,  the  day  before 
the  evacuation  of  the  D a n n e v i r k e.  It  is  called  black  a nd  yellow  after  t he 
facings  of t he  two  regiments  composing  it,  a nd  was  always  considered  o ne 
of the  best  brigades  in  t he  service.  They  were,  however,  b e a t en  by  t he  n e e 
dle-gun,  a nd  above  500  m en  of  o ne  of  its  regiments  (Martini)  were  t a k en 
prisoners  after  they  h ad  charged  the  Prussian  lines  five  t i m es  in  vain.  In  a 
later  engagement,  the  colours  of the  3d  battalion  of the  D e u t s c h m e i s t er reg 
iment  were  taken.  This  regiment,  recruited  in  V i e n na  exclusively,  is  con 
sidered  the  best  in  the  whole  army.  T h us  the  very  best  troops  have  b e en  al 
ready  in  action.  T he  Prussians  m u st  h a ve  behaved  splendidly  for  an  old 
peace  army.  W h en  war  was  actually  declared,  a  totally  different  spirit  c a me 
over  the  army,  brought  on,  chiefly,  by  the  clearing-out  of  the  small  fry  of 
potentates  in  the  north-west.  It  gave  the  troops—rightly  or  wrongly,  we 
merely  register  t he  fact—the  idea  t h at  they  were  asked  to  fight,  this  t i m e, 
for  the  unification  of  G e r m a n y,  a nd  the  hitherto  sullen  a nd  sulky  m en  of 
the  reserve  a nd  landwehr  t h en  crossed  the  frontier  of  Austria  with  l o ud 
cheers.  It  is  owing  to  this  chiefly  t h at  they  fought  so  well;  b ut  at  t he  s a me 
time  we  m u st  ascribe  t he  greater  portion  of whatever  success  they  have  h ad 
to  their  breech-loaders;  a nd  if  they  ever  get  o ut  of  the  difficulties  into 
which  their  generals  so  wantonly  placed  t h e m,  they  will  have  to  t h a nk  t he 
needle  g un  for  it.  T he  reports  as  to  its  i m m e n se  superiority  over  t he  m u z 
zle-loaders  are  again  u n a n i m o u s.  A  sergeant  from  the  M a r t i ni  regiment, 
taken  prisoner,  said  to  the  correspondent  of  the  Cologne  Gazette :  " We  h a ve 
surely  d o ne  whatever  m ay  be  expected  from  brave  soldiers,  but  no  m an  can 
stand  against  t h at  rapid  fire."  If  the  Austrians  are  beaten,  it  will  be  n ot  so 
m u ch  G e n e r al  B e n e d ek  or  G e n e r al  R a m m i ng  as  G e n e r al  R a m r od  who  is  to 
blame  for  t he  result. 

In  the  north-west,  the  Hanoverians,  brought  to  a  sense  of  their  position 
by  a  sharp  attack  from  G e n e r al  Manteuffel's  advanced  guard  u n d er  G e n 
eral  Flies,  have  surrendered,  a nd  thereby  59  Prussian  battalions  will  be  at 
liberty  to  act  against  the  Federal  troops.  It  was  high  t i m e,  too,  that  this 
should  be  d o ne  before  Bavaria  h ad  completed  all  her  a r m a m e n t s,  for  other

T he  c a m p a i gn  which  the  Prussians  o p e n ed  with  a  signal  strategic  blunder 
has  b e en  since  carried  on  by  t h em  with  s u ch  a  terrible  tactical  energy  that 
it  was  brought  to  a  victorious  close  in  exactly  eight  days. 

We  said  in  our  last  n o te  that  the  only  case  in  which  the  Prussian  plan  of 
invading  B o h e m ia  by  two  armies  separated  by  t he  Riesengebirge  could  be  10 
justified  was  that  in  which  B o h e m ia  was  u n o c c u p i ed  by  hostile  troops.  The 
mysterious  p l an  of  G e n e r al  B e n e d ek  appears  to  have  m a i n ly  consisted  in 
creating  a  situation  of  that  sort.  There  appear  to  have  b e en  b ut  two  Aus 
trian  army  corps—the  1st  (Clam  Gallas)  a nd  t he  6th  ( R a m m i n g ) — in  the 
north-western  corner  of  Bohemia,  where,  from  the  beginning,  we  expected 
the  decisive  actions  would  be  fought.  If this  was  i n t e n d ed  to  draw  the  Prus 
sians  into  a  trap,  B e n e d ek  has  succeeded  so  well  that  he  got  caught  in  it 
himself.  At  all  events,  t he  Prussian  advance  on  two  lines,  with  from  forty  to 
fifty  miles  of  impassable  ground  between  t h e m,  towards  a  point  of  junction, 
two 
lines,—this  advance  r e m a i ns  a  highly  dangerous  m a n œ u v re  u n d er  all  cir 
c u m s t a n c e s,  a nd  one  which  would  have  b e en  followed  by  signal  defeat  but

troops,  and  for  their  breech-loading  rifles.

T he  advance  of Prince  Frederick  Charles  took  place  with  three  corps  (the 
3d,  4th,  a nd  2d,  t he  latter  in  reserve),  by  Reichenberg,  n o r th  of  a  difficult 
range  of  hills,  on  the  southern  side  of  which  G e n e r al  Herwarth  advanced 
with  a  corps  a nd  a  half  (the  8th  a nd  o ne  division  of  the  7th).  At  the  same 
time,  the  Crown  Prince  stood,  with  the  1st,  5th,  a nd  6th  corps,  a nd  the 
G u a r d s,  in  the  m o u n t a i ns  about  Glatz.  T h us  t he  army  was  divided  into  30 
three  c o l u m n s — o ne  on  the  right,  of  45,000,  o ne  in  the  centre,  of  90,000, 
a nd  o ne  on  the  left,  of  120,000  m e n — n o ne  of  which  could  support  either 
of the  others  for  at  least  several  days.  H e r e,  if ever,  there  was  a  c h a n ce  for  a

and  beat  t he  6th  A u s t r i an  corps  ( R a m m i n g)  severely;  on  the  28th,  the  only 
slightly  u n l u c ky  day  for  the  Prussians,  Prince  Frederick  Charles's  advance 
guard  took  Gitschin,  b ut  was  again  dislodged  by  G e n e r al  E d e l h e i m 's  cav 
alry,  while  the  1st  corps  of the  army  of t he  Crown  Prince  was  checked  with 
some  loss  at  T r a u t e n au  by  t he  10th  Austrian  corps  of  G a b l e n z,  a nd  only 
disengaged  by  the  advance  of the  G u a r ds  towards  Eipel,  on  an  i n t e r m e d i a te 
road  between  the  1st  a nd  5th  Prussian  corps.  On  the  29th,  Prince  Frederick 
Charles  stormed  Gitschin,  a nd  the  army  of  t he  Crown  P r i n ce  totally  de 
feated  the  6th,  8th,  a nd  10th  A u s t r i an  corps.  On  the  30th,  a  fresh  a t t e m pt  of 
Benedek's  to  re-take  G i t s c h in  by  the  1st  corps  a nd  the  Saxon  a r my  was  sig 
nally  foiled,  and  t he  two  Prussian  armies  effected  a  j u n c t i o n.  T he  A u s t r i an 
loss  represents  m en  to  t he  n u m b er  of  at  least  a  corps  a nd  a  half,  while  t h at 
of the  Prussians  is  less  t h an  o ne  fourth  t h at  n u m b e r. 

T h us  we  find  that  on  the  27th  there  were  only  two  A u s t r i an  army  corps, 
of  about  33,000  m en  each,  at  h a n d;  on  t he  28th,  three;  on  the  29th,  four, 
and  if o ne  Prussian  telegram  be  correct,  part  of a  fifth  (the  4 th  corps);  while 
on  the  30th  the  Saxon  army  corps  only  h ad  b e en  able  to  c o me  up  in  sup 
port.  There  were,  t h e n,  two,  if  n ot  three,  corps  absent  from  the  contested 
ground  during  all  that  t i m e,  while  the  Prussians  brought  every  m an  down 
into  B o h e m i a.  In  fact,  up  to  t he  evening  of the  29th,  the  whole  of the  A u s 
trian  troops  on  t he  spot  were  barely  superior  in  n u m b e rs  to  either  of  t he 
two  Prussian  armies,  a nd  being  brought  into  line  successively,  the  supports 
arriving  after  the  defeat  only  of the  troops  first  engaged,  the  result  was  dis 
astrous. 

The  3d  army  corps  (Archduke  Ernest),  which  fought  at  Custozza,  is  re 
ported  to  have  b e en  sent  to  the  n o r th  by  rail  i m m e d i a t e ly  after  t h at  battle, 
and  is,  in  some  accounts,  set  down  a m o ng  Benedek's  available  forces.  This 
corps,  which  would  m a ke  t he  whole  force,  including  the  Saxons,  n i ne 
corps,  could  not  have  b e en  up  in  t i me  for  the  battles  in  the  latter  days  of 
June. 

The  Prussians,  whatever  the  faults  of their  plan  of operations  were,  m a de 
up  for  t h em  by  their  rapidity  a nd  energy  of  action.  No  fault  c an  be  found 
with  the  operations  of either  of their  two  armies.  Short,  sharp,  and  decisive 
were  all  their  blows,  a nd  completely  successful.  N or  did  this  energy  forsake 
them  after  the  two  armies  were  j o i n e d;  on  they  m a r c h e d,  a nd  already  on 
the  3d  they  m et  B e n e d e k 's  c o m b i n ed  forces  with  the  whole  of  theirs,  a nd 
gave  t h em  a  last  crushing  blow. 

It  is  hardly  possible  to  suppose  that  B e n e d ek  accepted  this  battle  of  his 

221 

Friedrich  Engels 

own  free  will.  No  d o u bt  the  rapid  pursuit  of t he  Prussians  compelled  h im  to 
take  a  strong  position  with  all  his  army,  in  order  to  re-form  his  troops,  and 
to  give  a  day's  start  to  his  retiring  army  train,  expecting  n ot  to  be  attacked 
in  force  during  t he  day,  a nd  to  be  able  to  draw  off during  the  night.  A  man 
in  his  position,  with  four  of  his  corps  completely  shattered,  a nd  after  such 
t r e m e n d o us  losses,  c a n n ot  have  desired,  there  a nd  t h e n,  to  deliver  a  deci 
sive  battle,  if he  could  draw  off  in  safety.  B ut  t he  Prussians  appear  to  have 
compelled  h im  to  fight,  a nd  the  result  was  the  complete  r o ut  of the  Austri 
ans,  who,  if  t he  armistice  be  n ot  granted,  will  now  be  trying  to  m a ke  to 
wards  O l m u tz  or  V i e n n a,  u n d er  the  most  disadvantageous  circumstances, 
for  t he  slightest  out-flanking  m o v e m e nt  of the  Prussians  on  their  right  must 
cut  off  n u m e r o us  d e t a c h m e n ts  from  the  direct  road,  a nd  drive  t h em  into 
the  hills  of  Glatz,  to  be  m a de  prisoners.  T he  "army  of the  n o r t h ,"  as  splen 
did  a  host  as  there  was  in  E u r o pe  ten  days  ago,  has  ceased  to  exist. 

No  d o u bt  the  n e e d le  gun,  with  its  rapid  fire,  has  d o ne  a  great  part  of this. 
It  m ay  be  d o u b t ed  whether  without  it  the  j u n c t i on  of  the  two  Prussian  ar 
m i es  could  have  b e en  effected;  a nd  it  is  quite  certain  t h at  this  immense 
a nd  rapid  success  could  n ot  have  b e en  o b t a i n ed  without  s u ch  superior  fire, 
for  the  A u s t r i an  a r my  is  habitually  less  subject  to  p a n ic  t h an  m o st  Euro 
p e an  armies.  But  there  were  other  circumstances  co-operating.  We  have  al 
ready  m e n t i o n ed  the  excellent  dispositions  a nd  u n h e s i t a t i ng  action  of  the 
two  Prussian  armies,  from  the  m o m e nt  they  entered  B o h e m i a.  We  m ay  add 
t h at  they  also  deviated,  in  this  campaign,  from  the  c o l u mn  system,  and 
b r o u g ht  t h e ir  masses  forward  principally  in  deployed  lines,  so  as  to  bring 
every  rifle  into  activity,  a nd  to  save  their  m en  from  the  fire  of  artillery.  We 
m u st  acknowledge  that  the  m o v e m e n ts  b o th  on  the  m a r ch  a nd  before  the 
e n e my  were  carried  o ut  with  an  order  and  punctuality  which  no  m an  could 
have  expected  from  an  army  a nd  a d m i n i s t r a t i on  covered  with  the  rust  of 
fifty  years'  p e a c e.  A n d,  finally,  all  the  world  m u st  have  b e en  surprised  at 
the  dash  displayed  by  t h e se  young  troops  in  e a ch  a nd  every  engagement 
without  exception.  It  is  all  very  well  to  say  t he  breech-loaders  did  it,  but 
they  are  n ot  self-acting,  they  want  stout  hearts  a nd  strong  a r ms  to  carry 
t h e m.  T he  Prussians  fought  very  often  against  superior  n u m b e r s,  and  were 
almost  everywhere  t he  attacking  party;  the  Austrians,  therefore,  had  the 
choice  of g r o u n d.  A nd  in  attacking  strong  positions  a nd  barricaded  towns, 
the  advantages  of  t he  breech-loader  almost  disappear;  the  bayonet  has  to 
do  the  work,  a nd  there  has  b e en  a  good  deal  of  it.  T he  cavalry,  moreover, 
acted  with  the  same  dash,  a nd  with  t h em  cold  steel  a nd  speed  of horse  are 
the  only  weapons  in  a  charge.  T he  F r e n ch  canards  of P r u s s i an  cavalry  lines 
first  peppering  their  o p p o n e n ts  with  carbine  fire  (breech-loading  or  other 
wise)  and  t h en  rushing  at  t h em  sword  in  h a n d,  could  only  originate  among

been  p u n i s h ed  for  it  by  being  b o r ne  down  by  the  superior  i m p e t us  of  t he 
charging  e n e m y.  T h e re  is  no  mistaking  it,  the  Prussian  army  has,  within  a

without  any  noteworthy  check,  has  b e en  obtained,  except  that  campaign  of

feat  of  Ligny,  the  c a m p a i gn  of  Waterloo.

Instructions  for  the  Delegates 
of the  Provisional  General  Council. 
The  different  questions. 

1.—Organisation  of the  International  Association. 

Upon  the  whole,  the  Provisional  Central  C o u n c il  r e c o m m e nd  the  plan  of 
Organisation  as  traced  in  the  Provisional  Statutes.  Its  s o u n d n e ss  a nd  facili 
ties  of adaptation  to  different  countries  without  prejudice  to  unity  of action 
have  b e en  proved  by  two  years'  experience.  F or  the  n e xt  year  we  recom 
mend  L o n d on  as  t he  seat  of the  Central  Council,  the  C o n t i n e n t al  situation 
looking  unfavourable  for  change. 

The  m e m b e rs  of  the  Central  Council  will  of  course  be  elected  by  Con 

gress  (5  of  t he  Provisional  Statutes)  with  power  to  add  to  their  n u m b e r. 

The  General Secretary  to  be  chosen  by  Congress  for  o ne  year  a nd  to  be  t he 

only  paid  officer  of the  Association.  We  propose  £2  for  his  weekly  salary. 

The  u n i f o rm  annual  contribution  of  each 

individual  member  of  the  Associa 
tion  to  be  one  halfpenny  (perhaps  o ne  penny).  T he  costprice  of  cards  of 
membership  (carnets)  to  be  charged  extra. 

While  calling  u p on  t he  m e m b e rs  of  the  Association  to  form  benefit  so 
cieties  a nd  c o n n e ct  t h em  by  an  international  link,  we  leave  the  initiation  of 
this  question  (établissement  des  sociétés  de  secours  m u t u e l s.  A p p ui  m o r al 
et  matériel  accordé  a ux  orphelins  de  l'association)  to  t he  Swiss  who  origi 
nally  proposed  it  at  the  conference  of  S e p t e m b er  last.

2.—International  combination  of  efforts, 
by  the  agency  of the  Association, 
in  the  struggle  between  labour  and  capital. 

a. F r om  a  general  point  of view,  this  question  embraces  the  whole  activ 
ity  of  the  I n t e r n a t i o n al  Association  w h i ch  a i ms  at  c o m b i n i ng  a nd  genera 
lising  the  till  n ow  disconnected  efforts  for  e m a n c i p a t i on  by  the  working 
classes  in  different  countries. 

b. To  counteract  the  intrigues  of  capitalists  always  ready,  in  cases  of 
strikes  a nd  lockouts  to  m i s u se  the  foreign  w o r k m an  as  a  tool  against  the 
native  w o r k m a n,  is  o ne  of  the  particular  functions  which  o ur  society  has 
hitherto  performed  with  success.  It  is  o ne  of the  great  purposes  of the  Asso 
ciation  to  m a ke  t he  w o r k m en  of  different  countries  n ot  only  feel  b ut  act  as 
brethren  a nd  c o m r a d es  in  the  army  of  e m a n c i p a t i o n. 

c. O ne  great  " I n t e r n a t i o n al  c o m b i n a t i on  of efforts"  which  we  suggest  is  a 

the  situation  of  the  working  classes  of  all  countries  to  be 

statistical  enquiry  into 
instituted  by  the  working  classes  themselves.  To  act  with  any  success,  t he  mate 
rials  to  be  acted  u p on  m u st  be  known.  By  initiating  so  great  a  work,  the 
w o r k m en  will  prove  their  ability  to  take  their  own  fate  into  their  own 
h a n d s.  We  propose  therefore, 

T h at  in  each  locality,  where  b r a n c h es  of o ur  Association  exist,  t he  work 
be  i m m e d i a t e ly  c o m m e n c e d,  and  evidence  collected  on  the  different  points 
specified  in  the  subjoined  s c h e me  of  inquiry. 

T h at  the  Congress  invite  all  w o r k m en  of E u r o pe  a nd  the  U n i t ed  States  of 
A m e r i ca  to  collaborate  in  gathering  the  elements  of  the  statistics  of  the 
working  class;  that  reports  a nd  evidence  be  forwarded  to  the  Central  Coun 
cil.  T h at  the  Central  Council  elaborate  t h em  i n to  a  general  report,  adding 
the  evidence  as  an  appendix. 

T h at  this  report  together  with  its  a p p e n d ix  be  laid  before  the  n e xt  annual 
Congress,  a nd  after  having  received  its  sanction,  be  printed  at  t he  expence 
of  the  Association.

w h i ch  m ay  of  course  be  modified  by  e a ch  locality.

3.—Limitation  of the  working  day. 

A  preliminary  condition,  without  which  all  further  attempts  at  improve 
ment  and  e m a n c i p a t i on  m u st  prove  abortive,  is  the  limitation  of the  working 
day. 

20 

It  is  n e e d ed  to  restore  the  health  a nd  physical  energies  of  t he  working 
class,  t h at  is  the  great  body  of  every  n a t i o n,  as  well  as  to  secure  t h em  t he 
possibility  of  intellectual  development,  sociable  intercourse,  social  a nd  p o 
litical  action. 

25 

We  propose  8  hours  work  as  the  legal  limit  of  the  working  day.  This  limi-
tation  being  generally  claimed  by  the  w o r k m en  of  the  U n i t ed  States  of 
America,  the  vote  of  the  Congress  will  raise  it  to  the  c o m m on  platform  of 
the  working  classes  all  over  t he  world. 

30 

For  the  information  of  c o n t i n e n t al  m e m b e r s,  whose  experience  of  fac 
tory  law  is  comparatively  short  dated,  we  add  t h at  all  legal  restrictions  will 
fail  and  be  b r o k en  t h r o u gh  by  Capital  if  t he  period  of the  day  during  which 
the  8  working  h o u rs  m u st  be  taken,  be  n ot  fixed.  T he  length  of t h at  period 
ought  to  be  d e t e r m i n ed  by  the  8  working  h o u rs  a nd  the  a d d i t i o n al  pauses 
for  meals.  F or  instance,  if  the  different  interruptions  for  m e a ls  a m o u nt  to 
one  hour,  t he  legal  period  of  the  day  ought  to  e m b r a ce  9  hours,  say  from 
35  7 a.m.  to  4 p.m.,  or  from  8  a.m.  to  5  p.m.,  etc.  Nightwork  to  be  b ut  excep 
tionally  permitted,  in  trades  or  b r a n c h es  of  trades  specified  by  law.  T he 
tendency  m u st  be  to  suppress  all  nightwork.

4.—Juvenile  and  children's  labour  (both  sexes). 

We  consider  the  t e n d e n cy  of  m o d e rn  industry  to  m a ke  children  a nd  juve 
nile  persons  of b o th  sexes  co-operate  in  the  great  work  of social  production, 
as  a  progressive,  s o u nd  and  legitimate  tendency,  although  u n d er  capital  it 
was  distorted  into  an  a b o m i n a t i o n.  In  a  rational  state  of  society  every  child 
whatever,  from  the  age  of  9  years,  ought  to  b e c o me  a  productive  labourer  in 
the  s a me  way  that  no  able-bodied  adult  person  ought  to  be  e x e m p t ed  from 
the  general  law  of n a t u r e,  viz.:  to  work  in  order  to  be  able  to  eat,  a nd  work 
not  only  with  the  b r a in  but  with  the  h a n ds  too. 

However,  for  the  present,  we  have  only  to  deal  with  the  children  and 
y o u ng  persons  of  b o th  sexes  belonging  to  t he  working  people.  T h ey  ought 
to  be  divided  into  three  classes,  to  be  treated  differently;  the  first  class  to 
range  from  9  to  12;  the  second,  from  13  to  15  years;  a nd  the  third,  to  com 
prise  the  ages  of  16  a nd  17  years.  We  propose  t h at  the  e m p l o y m e nt  of  the 
first  class  in  any  workshop  or  housework  be  legally  restricted  to  two ;  that  of 
t he  second,  to  four;  a nd  t h at  of  the  third,  to  six  h o u r s.  F or  the  third  class, 
there  m u st  be  a  break  of at  least  o ne  h o ur  for  meals  or  relaxation. 

It  m ay  be  desirable  to  begin  elementary  school  instruction  before  the  age 
of  9  years;  but  we  deal  here  only  with  the  m o st  indispensable  antidotes 
against  t he  t e n d e n c i es  of  a  social  system  which  degrades  t he  working  m an 
into  a  m e re  i n s t r u m e nt  for  the  a c c u m u l a t i on  of capital,  a nd  transforms  par 
ents  by  their  necessities  into  slave-holders,  sellers  of  their  own  children. 
T he  right  of  children  a nd  juvenile  persons  m u st  be  vindicated.They  are  un 
able  to  act  for  themselves.  It  is,  therefore,  t he  duty  of society  to  act  on  their 
behalf. 

If  the  m i d d le  a nd  higher  classes  neglect  their  duties  toward  their  off-  30 

spring,  it  is  their  own  fault.  Sharing  the  privileges  of these  classes,  the  child 
is  c o n d e m n ed  to  suffer  from  their  prejudices. 

T he  case  of t he  working  class  stands  quite  different.  T he  working  m an  is 
no  free  agent.  In  too  m a ny  cases,  he  is  even  too  ignorant  to  u n d e r s t a nd  the 
t r ue  interest  of his  child,  or  the  n o r m al  c o n d i t i o ns  of h u m an  developement.  35 
However,  the  m o re  enlightened  part  of  t he  working  class  fully  understands 

230 

Instructions for  the  Delegates  of the  Provisional  General  Council 

that  the  future  of  its  class,  and,  therefore,  of  m a n k i n d,  altogether  d e p e n ds 
u p on  the  formation  of  t he  rising  working  generation.  T h ey  knpw  that,  b e 
fore  everything  else,  t he  c h i l d r en  a nd  juvenile  workers  m u st  be  saved  from 
the  crushing  effects  of t he  present  system.  This  can  only  be  effected  by  con-
verting  social  reason  i n to  social force,  and,  u n d er  given  circumstances,  there 
exists  no  other  m e t h od  of  doing  so,  t h an  t h r o u gh  general  laws,  enforced  by 
the  power  of t he  state.  In  enforcing  such  laws,  t he  working  class  do  not  for 
tify  g o v e r n m e n t al  power.  On  the  contrary,  they  transform  t h at  power,  n ow 
used  against  t h e m,  into  their  own  agency.  They  effect  by  a  general  act  what 
they  would  vainly  a t t e m pt  by  a  m u l t i t u de  of isolated  individual  efforts.

Proceeding  from  this  standpoint,  we  say  that  no  parent  a nd  no  employer 
ought  to  be  allowed  to  use  juvenile  labour,  except  when  c o m b i n ed  with  ed 
ucation. 

By  e d u c a t i on  we  u n d e r s t a nd  three  things. 

15 

Firstly:  Mental  education. 

Secondly:  Bodily  education,  s u ch  as  is  given  in  schools  of gymnastics,  a nd 

by  military  exercise. 

20 

25 

Thirdly:  Technological  training,  which  imparts  the  general  principles  of  all 
processes  of production,  and,  simultaneously  initiates  the  child  and  young 
person  in  t he  practical  use  a nd  h a n d l i ng  of  the  elementary  i n s t r u m e n ts  of 
all  trades. 

A  gradual  a nd  progressive  course  of mental,-  gymnastic,  a nd  technologi 
cal  training  ought  to  correspond  to  the  classification  of t he  juvenile  labour 
ers.  T he  costs  of  t he  technological  schools  ought  to  be  partly  m et  by  the 
sale  of their  products. 

T he  c o m b i n a t i on  of  paid  productive  labour,  m e n t al  e d u c a t i o n,  bodily 
exercise  a nd  polytechnic  training,  will  raise  the  working  class  far  above  the 
level  of  the  higher  and  m i d d le  classes. 

It  is  self-understood  t h at  the  e m p l o y m e nt  of  all  persons  from  9  a nd  to 
30  17  years  (inclusively)  in  nightwork  and  all  health-injuring  trades  m u st  be 

strictly  prohibited  by  law. 

5.  Co-operative  labour. 

It  is  the  business  of  t he  I n t e r n a t i o n al  Working  M e n 's  Association  to  c o m 
bine  and  generalize  the  spontaneous  movements  of  the  working  classes,  b ut 
35  not  to  dictate  or  i m p o se  any  doctrinary  system  whatever.  T he  Congress 
should,  therefore,  p r o c l a im  no  special  system  of  co-operation,  b ut  limit  itself 
to  the  e n u n c i a t i on  of  a  few  general  principles, 

( a)  We  acknowledge  t he  co-operative  m o v e m e nt  as  o ne  of the  transform-

231 

Karl  Marx 

ing  forces  of  the  p r e s e nt  society  based  u p on  class  a n t a g o n i s m.  Its  great 
merit  is  to  practically  show,  that  the  present  pauperising,  a nd  despotic  sys 
t em  of the  subordination  of labour  to  capital  can  be  superseded  by  the  repub 
lican  and  beneficent  system  of  the  association  of  free  and  equal  producers. 

(b)  Restricted,  however,  to  the  dwarfish  forms  into  which  individual 
wages  slaves  c an  elaborate  it  by  their  private  efforts,  t he  co-operative  sys 
t em  will  never  transform  capitalistic  society.  To  convert  social  production 
into  o ne  large  a nd  h a r m o n i o us  system  of free  a nd  co-operative  labour,  gen 
eral  social  changes  are  wanted,  changes  of  the  general  conditions  of  society, 
never  to  be  realised  save  by  the  transfer  of  the  organised  forces  of  society, 
viz.  the  State  power,  from  capitalists  a nd  landlords  to  t he  p r o d u c e rs  them 
selves. 

(c)  We  r e c o m m e nd  to  the  working  m en  to  e m b a rk  in  co-operative  produc 
tion  rather  t h an  in  co-operative  stores.  T he  latter  t o u ch  b ut  the  surface  of the 
present  e c o n o m i c al  system,  the  former  attacks  its  groundwork. 

(d)  We  r e c o m m e nd  to  all  co-operative  societies  to  convert  o ne  part  of 
their  j o i nt  i n c o me  into  a  fund  for  propagating  their  principles  by  example 
as  well  as  by  precept,  in  other  words,  by  p r o m o t i ng  the  establishment  of 
new  co-operative  fabrics,  as  well  as  by  teaching  a nd  preaching. 

(e)  In  order  to  prevent  co-operative  societies  from  degenerating  into  or 
dinary  m i d d le  class  j o i nt  stock  c o m p a n i es  (sociétés  par  actions),  all  work 
m en  employed,  whether  shareholders  or  not,  ought  to  share  alike.  As  a 
m e re  temporary  expedient,  we  are  willing  to  allow  shareholders  a  low  rate 
of  interest. 

6. Trades'  Unions.  Their past,  present  and  future. 

25; 

(a)  Their  past. 
Capital  is  concentrated  social  force,  while  the  w o r k m an  has  only  to  dis 
pose  of  h is  working  force.  T he  contract  between  capital  a nd  l a b o ur  can 
therefore  never  be  struck  on  equitable  t e r m s,  equitable  even  in  t he  sense  of 
\ 
a  society  which  places  the  ownership  of  the  material  m e a ns  of  life  and  la-  30] 
jj 
bour  on  o ne  side  and  the  vital  productive  energies  on  the  opposite  side, 
T he  only  social  power  of the  w o r k m en  is  their  n u m b e r.  T he  force  of num- 
I 
bers,  however,  is  broken  by  disunion.  T he  d i s u n i on  of  t he  w o r k m en  is 
created  a nd  perpetuated  by  their  unavoidable  competition  amongst  themselves. 

I 

Trades'  U n i o ns  originally  sprung  up  from  the  spontaneous  attempts  of  35j 

w o r k m en  at  removing  or  at  least  checking  that  competition,  in  order  to 
c o n q u er  s u ch  t e r ms  of  contract  as  m i g ht  raise  t h em  at  least  above  the  con 
dition  of  m e re  slaves.  T he  i m m e d i a te  object  of  T r a d e s'  U n i o ns  was  there-

fore  confined  to  everyday  necessities,  to  expediencies  for  the  obstruction  of 
the  incessant  e n c r o a c h m e n ts  of capital,  in  o ne  word,  to  questions  of wages 
and  t i me  of  labour.  This  activity  of  the  T r a d e s'  U n i o ns  is  n ot  only  legiti 
mate,  it  is  necessary.  It  c a n n ot  be  dispensed  with  so  long  as  the  p r e s e nt  sys-
tern  of p r o d u c t i on  lasts.  On  the  contrary,  it  m u st  be  generalised  by  the  for 
m a t i on  a nd  the  c o m b i n a t i on  of  T r a d e s'  U n i o ns  t h r o u g h o ut  all  countries. 
On  the  other  h a n d,  u n c o n s c i o u s ly  to  themselves,  t he  Trades'  U n i o ns  were 
forming  centres  of organisation  of the  working  class,  as  the  m e d i e v al  m u n i c i 
palities  a nd  c o m m u n es  did  for  the  m i d d le  class.  If  the  Trades'  U n i o ns  are 
required  for  the  guerilla  fights  between  capital  and  labour,  they  are  still 
more  i m p o r t a nt  as  organised  agencies for  superseding  the  very  system  of wages 
labour  and  capital  rule. 
(b)  Their  present. 
T oo  exclusively  b e nt  u p on  the  local  a nd  i m m e d i a te  struggles  with  capi-
tal,  the  Trades'  U n i o ns  have  not  yet  fully  understood  their  power  of acting 
against  t he  system  of  wages  slavery  itself.  T h ey  therefore  kept  too  m u ch 
aloof  from  general  social  a nd  political  m o v e m e n t s.  Of  late,  however,  they 
seem  to  awaken  to  some  sense  of their  great  historical  mission,  as  appears, 
for  instance,  from  their  participation,  in  England,  in  the  recent  political 
20  movement,  from  the  enlarged  views  t a k en  of  their  function  in  t he  U n i t ed 
States,  a nd  from  the  following  resolution  passed  at  the  recent  great  confer 
ence  of  Trades'  delegates  at  Sheffield:  "That  this  conference,  fully  appre 
ciating  the  efforts  m a de  by  the  I n t e r n a t i o n al  Association  to  u n i te  in  o ne 
c o m m on  b o nd  of  brotherhood  the  working  m en  of  all  countries,  m o st  ear-
25  nestly  r e c o m m e nd  to  various  societies  here  represented,  the  advisability  of 

15 

becoming  affiliated  to  t h at  body,  believing  t h at  it  is  essential  to  t he  prog 
ress  a nd  prosperity  of  t he  entire  working  c o m m u n i t y ." 

30 

35 

(c)  Their  future. 
Apart  from  their  original  purposes,  they  m u st  now  learn  to  act  delib-
erately  as  organising  centres  of the  working  class  in  the  broad  interest  of its 
complete  emancipation.  They  m u st  aid  every  social  a nd  political  m o v e m e nt 
tending  in  that  direction.  Considering  themselves  a nd  acting  as  t he  c h a m 
pions  and  representatives  of the  whole  working  class,  they  c a n n ot  fail  to  en 
list  the  non-society  m en  into  their  ranks.  They  m u st  look  carefully  after  the 
interests  of  the  worst  paid  trades,  such  as  the  agricultural  labourers,  ren 
dered  powerless  by  exceptional  circumstances.  They  m u st  convince  the 
world  at  large  that  their  efforts,  far  from  being  narrow  a nd  selfish,  a im  at 
the  e m a n c i p a t i on  of  the  d o w n t r o d d en  millions.

7. Direct  and  indirect  Taxation. 

(α)  No  m o d i f i c a t i on  of  t he  form  of  t a x a t i on  c an  p r o d u ce  any  i m p o r t a nt 

c h a n ge  in  t he  relations  of  labour  a nd  capital. 

(b)  Nevertheless,  having  to  choose  between  two  systems  of  taxation,  we 

r e c o m m e nd  t he  total  abolition  of indirect  taxes,  a nd  t he  general  substitution  of 

5 

direct 

taxes. 

Because  direct  taxes  are  cheaper  to  collect  a nd  do  n ot  interfere  with  pro­

d u c t i o n;  b e c a u se  indirect  taxes  e n h a n ce  t he  prices  of  c o m m o d i t i e s,  the 

t r a d e s m en  a d d i ng  to  t h o se  prices  n ot  only  t he  a m o u nt  of t he  i n d i r e ct  taxes, 

b ut  t he  interest  a nd  profit  u p on  t he  capital  a d v a n c ed  in  their  p a y m e n t; 

10 

Because  indirect  taxes  conceal  from  an  i n d i v i d u al  what  he  is  paying  to 

t he  state,  whereas  a  direct  tax  is  undisguised,  u n s o p h i s t i c a t e d,  a nd  n ot  to 

be  m i s u n d e r s t o od  by  t he  m e a n e st  capacity.  D i r e ct  t a x a t i on  p r o m p ts  there­

fore  every  individual  to  control  t he  governing  powers  while  i n d i r e ct  taxa­

9. Polish Question. 

( a)  W hy  do  t he  w o r k m en  of E u r o pe  take  up  this  q u e s t i o n?  In  t he  first  in­

stance,  b e c a u se  t he  m i d d le  class  writers  a nd  agitators  conspire  to  suppress  20 

it,  a l t h o u gh  they  patronise  all  sorts  of nationalities,  on  the  c o n t i n e n t,  even 

I r e l a n d.  W h e n ce  this  reticence?  Because  b o t h,  aristocrats  a nd  bourgeois, 

look  u p on  t he  dark  Asiatic  power  in  t he  b a c k g r o u nd  as  a  last  resource 

against  t he  advancing  tide  of  working  class  a s c e n d e n c y.  T h at  power  can 

only  be  effectually  p ut  down  by  t he  r e s t o r a t i on  of  P o l a nd  u p on  a  demo-  25 

cratic  basis. 

(b)  In  t he  present  c h a n g ed  state  of  c e n t r al  E u r o p e,  a nd  especially  Ger­

m a n y,  it  is  m o re  t h an  ever  necessary  to  h a ve  a  d e m o c r a t ic  P o l a n d.  Without 

it,  G e r m a ny  will  b e c o me  t he  outwork  of  t he  H o ly  Alliance,  with  it,  t he  co-

operator  with  r e p u b l i c an  F r a n c e.  T he  working  class  m o v e m e nt  will  contin-  30 

u o u s ly  be  interrupted,  checked,  a nd  retarded,  u n t il  this  great  E u r o p e an 

q u e s t i on  be  set  at  rest.

(c)  It  is  especially  t he  duty  of  the  G e r m an  working  class  to  take  the  in 
itiative  in  this  matter,  because  G e r m a ny  is  o ne  of  the  partitioners  of  Po 
land. 

10. Armies. 

5 

(a)  T he  deleterious  influence  of  large  standing  armies  u p on  production, 

has  b e en  sufficiently  exposed  at  m i d d le  class  congresses  of  all  d e n o m i n a 
tions,  at  peace  congresses,  e c o n o m i c al  congresses,  statistical  congresses, 
philanthropical  congresses,  sociological  congresses.  We  t h i nk  it,  therefore, 
quite  superfluous  to  expatiate  u p on  this  point. 

10 

(b)  We  propose  the  general  a r m a m e nt  of the  people  a nd  their  general  in 

struction  in  the  use  of  arms. 

( c ) We  accept  as  a  transitory  necessity  small  standing  armies  to  form 
schools  for  the  officers  of the  militia;  every  m a le  citizen  to  serve  for  a  very 
limited  t i me  in  those  armies.

Ladies  a nd  G e n t l e m e n, 

W h en  the  last  Russian  ukases  for  the  abolition  of Poland  b e c a me  k n o wn  in 
this  country,  the  organ  of the  leading  purses  exhorted  the  Poles  to  t u rn  into 
Muscovites.  W hy  should  they  not,  if it  were  only  to  give  further  security  for 
the  six  mill.  1.  st.  j u st  lent  to  the  Czar  by  t he  English  capitalists? 

S o me  30  years  ago,  a  Revolution  broke  o ut  in  F r a n c e.  It  was  an  event 
n ot  foreseen  by  the  St.  Petersburg  providence  which  h ad  j u st  concluded  a 
secret  treaty  with  Charles  X  for  the  better  a d m i n i s t r a t i on  a nd  geographical 
a r r a n g e m e nt  of Europe.  On  the  arrival  of t he  awkward  news,  t he  Czar  Nico-
laus  s u m m o n ed  t he  officers  of  his  horseguard  a nd  addressed  t h em  a  short, 
warlike  speech,  culminating  in  the  words:  à  cheval,  Messieurs!  This  was  no 
empty  threat.  Paskiewitch  was  despatched  to  Berlin  there  to  settle  t he  inva 
sion  of  F r a n c e.  A  few  m o n t hs  later,  all  was  ready.  T he  Prussians  were  to 
concentrate  on  t he  R h i n e,  the  Polish  army  to  m a r ch  into  Prussia,  a nd  the 
Muscovites  to  follow  in  the  rear.  But  t h e n,  as  Lafayette  said  in  the  French 
C h a m b er  of  D e p u t i e s — « l ' a v a nt  garde  t o u r n a it  contre  le  gros  de  l ' a r m é e », 
the  advanced  guard  t u r n ed  r o u nd  u p on  the  m a in  body.  T he  insurrection  of 
Warsaw  saved  E u r o pe  from  a  second  A n t i - J a c o b in  war. 

Eighteen  years  later,  there  was  a n o t h er  eruption  of the  revolutionary  vol 
cano,  or  rather  an  e a r t h q u a ke  shaking  the  whole  continent.  Even  the  Ger 
m a ns  began  to  fidget,  despite  the  m a t e r n al  leading-strings  in  which  Russia 
h ad  kept  t h em  ever  since  their  so-called  war  of  i n d e p e n d e n c e.  Still  more 
strange.  Of  all  G e r m an  cities,  V i e n na  was  the  first  to  try  its  h a n ds  at  barri 
cade  building,  and  successfully  too.  This  t i m e,  and,  perhaps,  for  t he  first 
t i me  in  his  history,  t he  R u ss  lost  his  temper.  T he  Czar  N i c o l a us  did  no 
longer  address  his  horseguard.  He  issued  a  manifesto  to  h is  people,  telling 
t h em  t h at  t he  F r e n ch  plague  h ad  infected  even  the  G e r m a n s,  t h at  it  ap 
p r o a c h ed  t he  frontiers  of  the  Empire  a nd  t h at  Revolution,  in  its  madness, 
casts  its  delirious  eyes  u p on  Holy  Russia.  No  wonder!  he  exclaimed.  This 
s a me  G e r m a ny  has  b e en  the  hotbed  of  infidelity  for  m a ny  years  past.  The 

244 

Draft for a  speech  at the  Polish  Meeting  in  London  January  22,  1867 

cancer  of  a  sacrilegious  philosophy  has  e a t en  into  the  vitals  of t h at  appar 
ently  solid  people.  A nd  t h e n,  he  winds  up  with  t he  following  apostrophe  to 
the  G e r m a n s:  "With  us  is  G o d!  K n ow  that,  ye  h e a t h e n s,  a nd  s u b m it  to  us, 
for  G od  is  with  u s !"  Very  soon  after,  through  t he  h a n ds  of his  trusted  ser-
vant  Nesselrode,  he  sent  another  bull  to  the  G e r m a n s,  b ut  quite  overflow 
ing  with  t e n d e r n e ss  for  that  h e a t h e n i sh  people.  W h e n ce  this  change? 

Why,  the  Berliners  h ad  n ot  only  m a de  a  Revolution,  they  h ad  proclaim 
ed  the  restauration  of Poland,  a nd  the  Prussian  Poles  deceived  by  t he  p o p u 
lar  e n t h u s i a sm  were  forming  military  c a m ps 
t he 
courtesies  of t he  Czar.  It  was  again  Poland,  the  i m m o r t al  Knight  of E u r o p e, 
that  h ad  warned  off the  M o n g o l!  Only  after  the  betrayal  of the  Poles  by  t he 
G e r m a n s,  especially  the  G e r m an  N a t i o n al  Assembly  at  Frankfort,  R u s s ia 
recovered  h er  forces  a nd  waxed  strong  e n o u gh  to  stab  the  Revolution  of 
1848  in  its  last  asylum,  H u n g a r y.  A nd  even  here,  the  last  m an  who  bestrode 
the  battlefield  against  her,  was  a  Pole,  G e n e r al  Bern. 

in  Posnania.  H e n ce

Now  there  are  m a ny  people  silly  e n o u gh  to  believe  t h at  all  this  h as 
changed,  t h at  Poland  h as  ceased  to  be  " u ne  n a t i on  nécessaire",  as  a  F r e n ch 
writer  calls  it,  a nd  dwindled  to  a  s e n t i m e n t al  souvenir,  a nd  you  know  t h at 
sentiments  a nd  souvenirs  are  n ot  q u o t ed  at  the  Stock  Exchanges.  B ut  I  ask 
20  you,  what  h as  changed?  Has  the  danger  grown  less?  N o.  Only  the  judicial 
blindness  of t he  governing  classes  of  E u r o pe  h as  reached  its  climax. 

25 

In  the  first  instance,  the  policy  of  Russia  is  u n c h a n g e a b l e,  as  averred  by 
her  official  historian,  t he  Muscovite  K a r a m z i n.  H er  m e t h o d s,  h er  tactics, 
her  manœuvering  m ay  change,  b ut  the  leading  star  of  her  policy  is  a  fixed 
star—the  empire  of the  world.  Only  a  civilized  g o v e r n m e nt  swaying  barbar 
ian  masses  c an  nowadays  h a t ch  such  a  plan,  a nd  execute  it.  As  the  greatest 
Russian  diplomatist  of  m o d e rn  times,  P o z zo  di  Borgo,  wrote  to  A l e x a n 
der  I,  at  t he  epoch  of t he  V i e n na  Congress,  P o l a nd  is  t he  great  tool  for  t he 
execution  of  the  world-embracing  schemes  of  Russia,  b ut  also  her  invinci-
30  ble  obstacle,  u n t il  t he  Pole,  fatigued  by  the  a c c u m u l a t ed  treacheries  of E u 

rope,  b e c o m es  her  scourge  in  the  h a nd  of  the  Muscovite. 

Now,  apart  from  the  dispositions  of the  Polish  people,  has  anything  h a p 

pened  to  thwart  t he  plans  of  Russia  or  paralyse  h er  a c t i o n? 

I  need  n ot  tell  you  t h at  in  Asia,  h er  progress  of conquest  is  c o n t i n u o u s.  I 
.35  need  not  tell  you,  that  the  so-called  A n g l o - F r e n ch  war  against  R u s s ia 
handed  over  to  h er  t he  m o u n t a in  forteresses  of  Caucasus,  the  d o m i n a t i on 
of  the  Black  Sea,  a nd  the  m a r i t i me  rights  which  Catherine  II,  P a ul  a nd 
Alexander  I  h ad  vainly  tried  to  wrest  from  England.  Railways  are  connect 
ing  a nd  concentrating  her  vastly  disseminated  b o n d s.  H er  material  re-
sources  in  Congress  Poland,  which  forms  h er  e n t r e n c h ed  c a mp  in  E u r o p e, 
have  enormously  increased.  T he  fortifications  of  Warsaw,  M o d l i n,  Ivan-

course  of  the  Vistula  a nd  constitute  a  formidable  basis  of  attack  to  the 
North,  West  a nd  South.  T he  Panslavonian  p r o p a g a n da  has  kept  pace  with 
the  enfeeblement  of Austria  a nd  Turkey,  a nd  what  that  Panslavonian  prop 
aganda  m e a n s,  you  h ad  some  foretaste  in  1 8 4 8 - 4 9,  when  H u n g a ry  was 
overrun,  V i e n na  laid  waste,  Italy  c o u n t e r ed  by  the  Slavs,  fighting  u n d er  the 
banners  of  Jellachich,  Windischgrätz  a nd  Radetzky!  A nd  besides  all  this, 
England's  wrongs  against  Ireland  have  raised  a  new  powerful  ally  of Russia 
on  the  other  side  of  the  Atlantic.

T he  plan  of R u s s i an  policy  r e m a i ns  u n c h a n g e a b l e,  h er  m e a ns  of  action 
have  wonderfully  increased  even  since  1848,  b ut  as  yet  t h e re  is  o ne  thing 
out  of reach,  a nd  Peter  the  First  hit  t he  weak  point  when  he  exclaimed  that 
to  conquer  t he  world,  the  Muscovites  wanted  n o t h i ng  but  souls.  Well,  this 
living  spirit,  which  Russia  lacks,  will  be  infused  into  her  carcass  the  mo 
m e nt  t he  Poles  t u rn  into  Russian  subjects.  W h at  t h en  will  you  have  to  15  ¿i 
throw  into  the  opposite  balance!

A  c o n t i n e n t al  E u r o p e an  will,  perhaps,  answer  t h at  Russia,  by  the  eman 
cipation  of  the  serfs,  has  entered  the  family  of  civilized  n a t i o n s,  that  the 
G e r m an  power  recently  concentrated  in  Prussian  h a n ds  c an  stand  any 
Asiatic  shock,  and,  lastly,  that  Social  R e v o l u t i on  in W e s t e rn  E u r o pe  will  do  20·. 
away  with  all  "international"  conflicts.  A  m e re  T i m e s — r e a d i ng  English 
m an  m ay  tell  me  that,  let  the  worst  arrive  to  the  worst,  a nd  Russia  seize 
Constantinople,  E n g l a nd  will  then  appropriate  Egypt  and  t h us  secure  the 
road  to  h er  great  I n d i an  market. 

In  the  first  instance,  the  e m a n c i p a t i on  of the  serfs,  has  e m a n c i p a t ed  the  25¾ 

supreme  government  from  t he  i m p e d i m e n ts  the  nobles  were  able  to  oppose 
to  its  centralized  action.  It  has  created  a  vast  recruiting  place  for  its  army, 
broken  up  the  c o m m on  property  of  the  R u s s i an  peasants,  insulated  them, 
and,  above  all,  strengthened  their  faith  in  their  pope-autocrat.  It  has  not  de 
odorized  their  Asiatic  barbarism,  the  slow  growth  of  centuries.  A ny  attempt 
at  raising  their  m o r al  standard  is  p u n i s h ed  as  a  crime.  I  r e m i nd  you  only  of 
the  official  provocations  against  the  t e m p e r a n ce  societies  w h i ch  h ad  under 
taken  to  wean  the  Muscovite  from  what  F e u e r b a ch  calls  t he  practical  sub 
stance  of  his  religion,  n a m e ly  brandy.  However  it  m ay  work  in  the  future, 
for  the  present  t he  serf e m a n c i p a t i on  has  increased  the  disposable  forces  of  35 
the  Czar. 

Now,  as  to  Prussia.  O n ce  a  vassal  of  Poland,  she  has  b ut  grown  into  a 
first  rate  power  u n d er  the  auspices  of  Russia,  a nd  by  the  partition  of  Po 
land.  If  she  lose  to-morrow  her  Polish  booty,  she  would  m e r ge  into  Ger 
m a ny  instead  of  absorbing  it.  To  m a i n t a in  herself  as  a  power  distinct  from  40, 
G e r m a n y,  she  m u st  fall  back  u p on  the  Muscovite.  H er  recent  access  of do-

246 

Draft for a  speech  at the  Polish  Meeting  in  London January  22,  1867 

main,  instead  of loosening  these  ties,  have  rendered  t h em  indissoluble,  be 
cause  it  has  h e i g h t e n ed  h er  a n t a g o n i sm  to  F r a n ce  a nd  Austria.  At  t he  s a me 
time  Russia  is  the  prop  u p on  which  the  arbitrary  rule  of the  H o h e n z o l l e rn 
dynasty  a nd  its  feudal  retainers  rest.  This  is  their  safeguard  against  popular 
disaffection.  Prussia  is,  therefore,  n ot  a  bulwark  against  the  Muscovite  b ut 
his  predestined  tool  for  t he  invasion  of F r a n ce  a nd  the  enslavement  of Ger 
many. 

5 

As  to  social  revolution,  what  does  it  m e an  if n ot  a  struggle  of classes?  It 
is  possible  t h at  the  struggle  between  the  w o r k m en  a nd  the  capitalist  will  be 
less  fierce  a nd  bloody  t h an  the  struggles  between  the  feudal  lord  a nd  t he 
capitalist  proved  in  E n g l a nd  and  in  France. 

10 

15 

We  will  h o pe  so.  But  at  all  events,  a l t h o u gh  s u ch  a  social  crisis  m ay 
rouse  the  energies  of  the  Western  peoples,  it  will,  like  all  internal  feuds, 
also  invite  aggression  from  abroad.  It  will  clothe  anew  R u s s ia  with  t he  char-
acter  she  bore  during  the  Anti-Jacobin  war  a nd  since  the  Holy  Alliance, 
that  of  t he  predestined  saviour  of  order.  It  will  enlist  in  her  ranks  all  the 
privileged  classes  of  E u r o p e.  Already  during  the  revolution  of  F e b r u a ry  it 
was  not  only  the  C o u nt  of M o n t a l e m b e r t,  w ho  laid  his  ear  to  the  g r o u nd  to 
listen  whether  there  was  a  distant  troop  of  Cossack  horses.  It  was  n ot  only 
20  Prussian  squires  who  proclaimed  in  the  m i d st  of  G e r m an  representative 
bodies  the  Czar  their  "Oberlandesvater".  It  was  all  the  Stock  Exchanges  of 
Europe  that  rose  with  every  R u s s i an  victory  over  the  Magyars  a nd  fell  at 
every  Russian  defeat. 

25 

Lastly,  as  to  the  " T i m e s"  saying  that  R u s s ia  m ay  seize  Constantinople,  if 
she  does  n ot  prevent  E n g l a nd  from  seizing  u p on  Egypt,  what  does  it  all 
mean?  T h at  England  will  surrender  Constantinople  to  Russia,  if R u s s ia  al 
lows  E n g l a nd  to  have  a  fight  with  F r a n ce  over  Egypt.  This  is  the  comfort 
able  vista  opened  to  y ou  by  the  Times.  As  to  R u s s i an  love  for  E n g l a n d, 
fond  as  she  is  of  British  f  .s.d.,  it  suffices  to  quote  the  words  of  t he  Gazette 
de  Moscou,  d.d.  D e c.  1 8 3 1:  « N o n,  il  faut  q ue  le  tour  de  perfide  A l b i on 
vienne,  et  dans  q u e l q ue  t e m ps  n o us  ne  devons  plus  faire  de  traité  avec  ce 
peuple  q u 'à  Calcutta.  »  (No,  it  is  necessary  t h at  the  t u rn  of  perfidious  Al 
bion  c o m e,  and  soon  we  shall  conclude  no  m o re  treaty  with  that  people, 
save  at  Calcutta.) 

35 

There  is  only  o ne  alternative  left  for  E u r o p e.  Asiatic  b a r b a r i sm  u n d er 
Muscovite  leadership  will  burst  over  h er  head  like  a  lawine,  or  she  m u st 
restore  Poland,  t h us  placing  between  herself  a nd  Asia  20  millions  of  h e 
roes,  and  gaining  breathing  t i me  for  the  a c c o m p l i s h m e nt  of  her  social  re 
generation.

Prolétaires, 

P a r mi  les  correspondances  q ue  n o us  recevons  n o us  voyons  q ue  les  mem 
bres  de  l'association  c o n t i n u e nt  à  propager  les  principes  et  à  a u g m e n t er  le 
n o m b re  des  b r a n c h es  de  l'association  internationale.  Ce  travail  est  surtout 
r e m a r q u a b le  en  Suisse,  où  la  plupart  de  n os  b r a n c h es  sont  activement  oc 
cupées  à  établir  des  sociétés  ouvrières  de  t o u te  sorte  et  à  les  m e t t re  en  rap 
port  avec  n o u s. 

La  Belgique,  depuis  le  massacre  de  M a r c h i e n n e s,  fait  des  efforts  dignes 

d'éloges  p o ur  masser  t o ut  le  prolétariat  belge  sous  notre  égide. 

M a is  différentes  causes  ont  entravé  cette  œ u v re  de  p r o p a g a n de  dans  les 

autres  pays  : 

L'Allemagne,  qui  avant  '48  avait  pris  t a nt  d'intérêt  d a ns  l'étude  des 
questions  sociales,  voit  presque  toutes  ses  forces  actives  absorbées  par  le 
m o u v e m e nt  u n i t a i re  qui  s'accomplit  d a ns  son  sein. 

En  F r a n c e,  vu  le  p eu  de  liberté  d o nt  j o u it  la  classe  ouvrière,  la  générali 
sation  de  n os  principes  et  de  notre  association  ne  s'est  pas  effectuée  d'une 
façon  aussi  rapide  q u ' on  aurait  pu  l'espérer:  car  n o us  eussions  cru  que 
l'appui  que,  grâce  à  nous,  les  sociétés  ouvrières  anglaises  ont  prêté  aux  so 
ciétés  ouvrières  françaises  lors  de  leurs  dernières  grèves,  aurait  dû  nous 
conquérir  le  soutien  de  tous  les  ouvriers  français.  M a i n t e n a nt  q u ' en  France 
la  lutte  entre  la  classe  capitaliste  et  la  classe  ouvrière  rentre  d a ns  la  phase 
q ue  n o us  appellerons  anglaise,  c'est-à-dire,  p r e n a nt  un  caractère  nettement

L'Angleterre,  occupée  qu'elle  était  par  le  m o u v e m e nt  réformiste,  a  laissé 
pour  un  m o m e nt  de  côté  le  m o u v e m e nt  é c o n o m i q u e.  M a is  m a i n t e n a nt  q ue 
ce  m o u v e m e nt  a  cessé,  q ue  l ' e n q u ê te  sur  les  trades'  unions  fait  r é n u m é r a

l'heure  est  venue  p o ur  q ue  toutes  les  sociétés  ouvrières  c o m p r e n n e nt  n o t re 
utilité.  Déjà,  à  plusieurs  reprises,  dans  des  r é u n i o ns  de  délégués  de  la 
classe  ouvrière,  le  rôle  de  notre  association  a  été  apprécié  à  sa j u s te  valeur 
et  un  grand  n o m b re  de  sociétés  se  sont  déjà  fondues  dans  notre  sein.  L ' A n 
gleterre,  grâce  à  la  puissante  organisation  q ue  possède  la  classe  ouvrière  est 
appelée  à  être  un  de  nos  plus  fermes  appuis. 

Les  Etats-Unis  s e m b l e nt  avoir  acquis  u ne  nouvelle  j e u n e s se  d a ns  la 
15  guerre  sanglante  qu'ils  v i e n n e nt  de  traverser :  la  classe  ouvrière  s'est  déjà 
centralisée  et  a  exercé  son  action  sur  le  g o u v e r n e m e nt  bourgeois,  q ui  règne 
sur  l ' A m é r i q ue  et  a  forcé  plusieurs  législatures  d'Etat  à  accepter  le  bill  de 
huit  heures  de  travail.  A  l'occasion  de  l'élection  du  prochain  président  les 
différents  partis  politiques  ont  été  obligés  de  faire  leur  profession  de  foi  :  le 

20  parti  radical  par  la  b o u c he  de  W a d e,  président  du  Sénat,  a  r e c o n nu  la  n é 
cessité  de  s'occuper  avant  tout  et  spécialement  de  la  question  du  travail  et 
du  capital,  et  il  s'est  p r o n o n cé  franchement  pour  u ne  transformation  de  la 
propriété  capitaliste  et  foncière.  C o m me  d a ns  ce  pays,  la  classe  ouvrière 
jouit  d ' u ne  force  d'organisation  considérable,  elle  sera  capable  d'imposer 

25  ses  volontés. 

D a ns  tous  les  pays  civilisés  à  l'heure  présente  la  classe  ouvrière  est  en 
train  de  s'agiter  et  c'est  dans  les  pays  où  l'industrie  m a n u f a c t u r i è re  est  la 
plus  développée,  c o m me  en  A m é r i q ue  et  en  Angleterre,  q ue  l'on  trouve 
une  organisation  plus  c o m p a c te  de  la  classe  ouvrière  et  u ne  lutte  p l us  ar-

30  dente  entre  la  classe  bourgeoise  et  la  classe  ouvrière. 

En  présence  de  la  force  du  capital,  la  force  individuelle  h u m a i ne  a  dis 
paru,  dans  u ne  m a n u f a c t u re  l'ouvrier  n'est  plus  q u ' un  rouage  de  la  m a 
chine.  Pour  q ue  l'ouvrier  put  retrouver  son  individualité,  il  a  dû  s'unir,  for 
m er  des  associations  p o ur  défendre  son  salaire,  sa  vie.  J u s q u 'à  a u j o u r d ' h ui 
35  ces  associations  étaient  restées  locales,  m a is  le  capital,  grâce  aux  nouvelles 
inventions  de  l'industrie,  voit  sa  force  s'accroître  tous  les  j o u rs  ;  aussi  les 
associations  nationales  sont  devenues  d a ns  un  grand  n o m b re  de  cas  im 
puissantes  :  en  é t u d i a nt  les  luttes  de  la  classe  ouvrière  anglaise,  on  voit  q ue 
pour  résister  à  leurs  ouvriers  les  patrons,  tantôt  font  venir  des  ouvriers 
étrangers,  tantôt  font  faire  l'ouvrage  dans  des  pays  où  la  m a in  d'oeuvre  est  à 
meilleur  m a r c h é.  En  présence  de  cet  état  de  choses,  si  la  classe  ouvrière

Dans  u ne  circulaire  q ue  M.  Otto  H ü b n e r,  directeur  des  Archives  centrales

Le  p e u p le  est  plus  q ue  surchargé.  A  part  les  fabriques  des  armes,  presque

a  member  and  wishing  to  know  if he  could  remain  a  member without  taking  part  in 
or  attending  the  Meetings  as  the  distance  he  lived  from  London  would  prevent  his 
doing  so,  a  Letter  was  also  read  from  M  Bocquet  asking  the  same  question.

had  been  violated,  he  also  complained  of the  Address  having  been  published  with 
out  the  sanction  of the  Committee. 

The  Secretary  explained  that  he  had  nothing  to  do  with  the  reports  at  which  he 
was very much  surprised,  he  believed  Mr Hartwell had  supplied  the  reports  in  ques 
tion. 

To  obviate  the  recurrence  of such  erroneous  reports  Dr  Marx  proposed  Mr  Fon 
tana  seconded  that  the  Sec  purchase  a Manifold writer  and  that  for the  future  all re 
ports  for  the  Press  be  sent  through  the  Secretary. 

Mr  Aldovrandi  proposed  and  Mr  Carter  seconded  that  Dr  Marx  be  requested  to 
correct  the  typographical  errors  in  the  Address  and  that  500  Copies  of the  Address,

They  enter  your  compact  and  pledge  themselves  to  the  fulfilment  of the  duties 
contained  in  it.—A  bond  of  union  has  been  formerly  established  in  the  recent 
Working  Men's  Congress  at Naples  between  most  of the  Italian Working  Men's As-
sociations.—A  central  direction  has  been  elected  and  we  have  no  doubt  that  what 
we now  do,  will be  done  at no  distant period by  that  central direction  for the  bulk of 
our  Italian  confederate  Brothers.  To  establish  a  general  practical  brotherhood,  a 
general  unity  of  aim  amongst  the  Working  Men  of  all  nations,  to  promote  every

•  -r  affecting  the  condition  of Working Men,  from taxation,  electoral reform  and  politi 
cal  rights  to  mutual  relief societies,  cooperation,  and  educational  institutions  (for 
this  must  be  your  aim),  is  no  doubt  a  bold  attempt  fraught  with  difficulties  requir-

After  the  reading  of  the  above  Dr  Marx  resumed  the  adjourned  debate  on  the  Ad 
dress  which  it  is  proposed  to  send  to  the  National  Government  of Poland,  and  in  a 
very  able  historical  resumé  argued  that  the  traditional  foreign  policy  of France  had 
not  been  favourable  to  the  restoration  and  independence  of Poland.  The  Address  of 
Dr Marx  was  pregnant with  important  historical  facts  which would  be  very valuable 
in  a  published  form. 

Mr  Fox  in  reply  stated  he  did  not  defend  the  foreign  policy  of modem  France,  all 
he  contended  for  was  that  the  foreign  policy  of old  France  had  been  favourable  to 
the  Independence  of  Poland. 

The  following  was  then  proposed  by  Mr  Jung  seconded  by  Le  Lubez  and  unani 

mously  adopted 

That  the  views  expressed  in  the  Address  concerning  the  French  foreign  policy 
towards  Poland  not  being  borne  out  by  historical  facts,  that  it  be  amended  ||[23]|  so 
as  to  accord  with  the  truths  of history. 

It was  then  unanimously  agreed  to  invite  Messrs  Beesly,  Beales  and  Harrison  to 
the  Soiree  which  is  to  be  held  on  the  16th  inst.  The  Meeting  then  adjourned  to  Jan'y

Vice  President  Eccarius  in  the  Chair.  The  Minutes  of  the  former  Meeting  having 
been  read  were  confirmed  on  the  motion  of Mr  Dell  seconded  by  M  Le  Lubez— 
The  following  address  from  the  three  German  Working  Men's  Societies  in  Lon 

don  was  then  read  by  the  Secretary 

To  the  Central  Council  of the  Working  Men's  International Association-
Fellow  Workmen,—The,  Londoner Arbeiter Bildungs  Verein,  2,  Nassau  street,  Soho, 
at  a general  meeting,  held  on  the  4th  January,  1865,  and  attended  by  the  delegates 
of the  two  kindred  societies  in  the  East  and  South  of London,  passed  the  following 
resolution:—"That  the  three  societies,  the  Londoner Arbeiter  Bildungs  Verein,  the 
Teutonia,  and  the  Eintracht,  as  an  affiliated  body,  join  the  International  Working 
Men's  Association  as  one  society."  The  Londoner  Arbeiter  Bildungs  Verein  was 
founded  on  February  7th,  1840,  and  is  consequently  a  quarter  of  a  century  old. 
During  the  first  years  of  its  existence  it  was  in  constant  communication  with  the 
Socialists  and  Chartists  of  this  country.  From  1846  to  1848  the  French  Social-
Democratic  Society,  the  Fraternal  Democrats,  and  this  society,  were  united  under 
the  same  roof.  It was  by  means  of these  international  communications  that  this  so 
ciety  was  enabled  to  fulfil  a  great  mission—that  of  propagating  amongst  the  Ger 
man working  men  those  principles  and  ideas  which agitated  England  and  France  at 
a  time  when  all  public  discussion  of social  and  political  questions  was  next  to  im 
possible  within  the  confines  of the  German  Confederation.  We  have  thus  acted  as 
interpreters  between  the  east  and  west  of Europe;  we  have  contributed  our  mite  to 
wards  removing  the  delusion  amongst  the  working  men  of Germany,  that  Constitu 
tional  Government  and  the  rule  of the  capitalists  are  synonymous  with  the  welfare 
of the  people.  We  hail  with joy  the  prospect  of an  enduring  international  union  be 
tween  the  too  long  estranged  working  classes  of  the  different  countries  of Europe, 
being  convinced  that  nothing  but  the  combined  action  of the  working  men  of  the 
whole  of civilised  Europe  will  ever  be  able  to  resist  the  combined  action  of all  the 
oppressors  of Europe.

It  was  then  proposed  by  Mr. Whitlock,  seconded  by  Mr.  Le  Lubez,  and  carried, 
"That  the  three  German  Societies,  having  subscribed  to  the  principles  of the  Inter­
national  Association,  be  admitted  as  affiliated  societies,  and  the  delegates  from 
them  take  their  seats  as  members  of the  central  council." 

A  deputation  from the  National  League  for  the  Independence  of Poland,  and  re­
presentatives  of the  National  Government  of Poland,  were  then  received,  their  ob­
ject  being  to  consult  the  central  council  as  to  the  propriety  of  holding  a  public 
meeting  to  commemorate  the  Polish  Revolution  of 1863.  Mr.  E.Beales,  on  behalf of 
the  National  League,  and  Captain  K. Bobczynski,  as  a  representative  of the  Polish 
National  Government,  addressed  the  meeting,  followed  by  Messrs.  Fox,  Dell,  Whit­
lock,  Holtorp,  Eccarius,  Le  Lubez,  Jung,  Cremer,  Bolleter,  and  Carter,  all  agreeing 
that  the  independence  of  Poland  was  of  paramount  importance  to  the  peace  and 
liberties  of  Europe. 

It was  then  proposed  by  Mr.Lucraft,  seconded  by  Mr. Eccarius,  and  unanimously 
adopted,  "That  should  the  Polish  committee  call  the  meeting,  this  association 
pledges  itself to  assist  by  all  means  in  its  power  the  commemoration  of the  glorious, 
though  unsuccessful,  Revolution  of  1863." 

The  sub-committee  were  appointed  to  act  in  conjunction  with  the  Polish  com­

mittee  and  the  National  League  to  carry  out  the  above  resolution. 

The  Council  adjourned  to  January  17th.

Legation  of the  United  States 
London  2 8th  Jan'y  1865 

Sir 
I  am  directed  to  inform  you  that  the  Address  of the  Central  Council  of your  Asso 
ciation,  which  was  duly  transmitted  through  this  Legation  to  the  President  of the 
United  [States],  has  been  received  by  him. 

So  far  as  the  sentiments  expressed  by  it  are  personal  they  are  accepted  by  him 
with  a  sincere  and  anxious  desire  that  he  may  be  able  to  prove  himself not unwor 
thy  of the  confidence  which  has  been  recently  extended  to  him  by  his  fellow  citi 
zens  and  by  so  many  of the  Friends  of Humanity  ||[27]|  and  Progress  throughout  the 
World. 

The  Government  of  the  United  States  has  a  clear  consciousness  that  its  policy 
neither  is  nor  could  be  reactionary  but  at  the  same  time  it  adheres  to  the  course 
which  it  adopted  at the  beginning of abstaining everywhere from propagandism  and 
unlawful  intervention.  It  strives  to  do  equal  and  exact justice  to  all  States  and  to  all

men  and  it  relies  upon  the  beneficial  results  of that  effort  for  support  at  home  and 
for respect  and  goodwill  throughout  the  World.  Nations  do  not  exist  for  themselves 
alone,  but  to  promote  the  welfare  and  happiness  of mankind  by  benevolent  inter 
course  and  example.  It  is  in  this  relation  that  the  United  States  regard  their  cause 
in  the  present  conflict  with  Slavery,  maintaining  insurgents  as  the  cause  of Human 
Nature;  and  they  derive  new  encouragement  to  persevere  from  the  testimony  of the 
Working  Men  of  Europe  that  the  national  attitude  is  favoured  with  their  enlight 
ened  approval  and  earnest  sympathies.

allow  the  entire  publication  of the  address,  which,  however,  they  printed  in  part,  in 
proof of the  deep  interest  which  the  association  has  excited.  It  may  be  mentioned 
that  hundreds  of cards  have  been  sent  for  from  Paris,  Belgium,  etc.;  and,  although 
in  some  places  on  the  Continent  working  men  are  prohibited  from  openly  associat 
ing  together  for  such  principles  as  the  International  has  in  view,  yet  even  in  those 
places  they  are  exerting  themselves  to  find  some  plan  whereby  they  may  affiliate 
themselves  to  the  association  without  coming  within  the  power  of the  law.

Vice  President  Eccarius  in  the  Chair. 

The  minutes  of  the  previous  meeting  having  been  read.  Cit  Le  Lubez  said  that 
the  remark  in the  minutes  which  indicated  that  he  had  advised  Cit Tolain's  resigna 
tion  to  be  accepted was  not  exactly  correct,  he  might have  been  a  little  hasty but he 
thanked  those  who  had  checked  him.  Cit  Fox  suggested  that  a  slight  alteration  be 
made  in  that part  of the  ||[32]|  minutes  which  referred  to  the  Republican  League  in

correspondence  from  Paris  which  referred  to  unpleasant  proceedings  having  taken 
place  there  and  as  it was generally  agreed  that  it  would  be  difficult  to  settle  the  dif-  15 
ferences  by  correspondence,  it was  decided  on  the  proposition  of Cit Whitlock  sec 
onded  by  Fontana  that  Le  Lubez  be  sent  to  Paris  to  investigate  the  differences  ex 
isting  between  Cit  Lefort  and  Cit  Fribourg.  Cit  Marx  proposed  Cit  Lessner 
seconded  that M  Schily  be  appointed  to  cooperate  with  Cit  Le  Lubez  in  settling  the 
differences.  Carried  Unanimously. 

20 

It  was  also  agreed  that  the  delegates  be  invested  with  power  to  act  as  circum 

stances  may  determine. 

The  Secretary  then  introduced  the  question  of the  Suffrage,  he  also  read  a  letter 
from  Mr  Beales  on  the  question  and  it  was  generally  understood  that  no  measure 
short  of  manhood  Suffrage  would  receive  the  support  of  the  Council,  it  was  also  25 
thought  advisable  that  as  many  as  could  should  attend  the  meeting  on  Thursday—

was  warmly  congratulated  by  the  Council  and  Cit  Whitlock  proposed  Cit  Wheeler

5 

recommended  by  it  in  reference  to  the  Imbroglio  in  Paris. 

It was  agreed  to  consider  the  resolutions  seriatim.  The  reporter read  the  following 

first  Resolution  proposed  by  the  Committee 

10 

I Whereas  Citizen  Tolain  has  several  times  tendered  his  resignation  and  the  Cen 
tral  Council  has  as  often  refused  to  accept  it  the  said  Council  now  leaves  it  to  Cit-
izen Tolain  and  the  Paris Administration  to  reconsider  ||[35]|  whether  or not under 
present  circumstances  this  resignation  be  opportune.  The  Central  Council  confirms 
beforehand  whatever  resolution  the  Administration  may  come  to  on  this  point.

II  In  deference  to  the wishes  of a meeting  of 32  members  of the  W.M.I.A.  held  in 
20  Paris  Feb'ry  24  and  in  obedience  to  the  principles  of popular  Sovereignty  and  self-
government  the  CC  cancels  its  resolution  relating  to  the  appointment  of an  official 
vindicator  for  the  French  Press.  At  the  same  time  the  Council  seizes  this  opportu 
nity of expressing  its  high  esteem for Cit Lefort,  in particular as  one  of the  initiators 
of the  I.W.M.A.  and  in  general  for his  approved  public  character  and  further  it  pro-
tests  that  it  does  not  sanction  the  principle  that  none  but  an  Ouvrier is  admissable 
as  an  official  in  our  Society— 

25 

Cit  Wolff proposed  that  that  part  of the  Resolution  which  cancelled  the  nomina 
tion  of Cit  Lefort be  omitted.  This  proposition]  was  decided by  the  President  to  be 
equivalent  to  a  rejection  of the  entire  resolution.  Cit  Wheeler  read  a  Letter  on  the 
subject  from  A.  Campbell  now  residing  in  Paris.  The  Resolution  was  supported  by 
the  following  Citizens  Fox,  Jung,  Dupont,  Marx,  Kaub,  and  Carter.  Citizens  Whit

305 

The  Minute  Book  of the  Provisional  Central  Council  of  the  I.W.M.A.

lain  be  confirmed  in  their  anterior  positions  and  that  the  addition  to  the  adminis 
tration  of Citizen  Vinçard  is  acknowledged.  Cit  Carter  proposed  the  above  Resolu 
tion  be  amended  as  follows— 

The  CC  resolves  that  the  present  administration  with  the  addition  of  Citizen 
Vinçard  be  confirmed,  Cit  Whitlock  seconded  the  Amendment  which  was  accepted 
and  unanimously  adopted.

The  CC  earnestly  requests  the  administration  at  Paris  to  come  to  an  understand 
ing  with  Citizens  Lefort  and  Beluze  so  as  to  admit  them  and  the  group  of Ouvriers 
they  represent  to  be  represented  in  the  administration  by  three  Members,  but  the 
CC  while  expressing  such  a  wish  has  no  power  nor desire  to  dictate  to  the  adminis 
tration  at  Paris.  Cit  Le  Lubez  opposed  this  Resolution  and  Citizen  Howell,  Jung, 
Wheeler,  Marx,  and  Carter  approved  it.  The  Resolution  was  carried  without  a  divi 
sion. 

In  consequence  of  Cit  Le  Lubez's  arguments  a  conversation  ensued  as  to  the 
powers  of  a  Branch  Society  in  France,  its  relations  towards  the  Administration  in 
Paris  and  the  CC  in  London. 

Cit  Whitlock  proposed,  Cit  Wheeler  seconded—That  in  case  no  compromise  be 
arrived  at  the  CC  declare  that the  group  Lefort  after having  taken  out  their  Cards  of 
Membership,  have  the  power  under  our  statutes  to  form  a  Branch  Society. 

Cit  Howell  proposed,  Cit  Dell  seconded  the  following  amendment—That  instead 
of  passing  a  formal  resolution  the  CC  instruct  its  French  Sec.  to  make  the  above 
declaration,  by  Letter,  to  M  Lefort  and  the  administration.  Cit  Lubez  declared  his 
preference  for  the  Resolution, 

The  amendment  was  carried  with  2  dissentients— 
The 5th 11 [37] I Resolution was then discussed and is as follows, 
The  administration  in  Paris  having  expressed  its  readiness  to  acknowledge  a  di 
rect  Delegation  from  the  Central  Council,  the  CC  accordingly  appoints  Citizen 
Schily  to  be  its  Delegate  to  the  said  administration. 

The  Resolution  was  Carried  Unanimously,  The  Council  then  adjourned  to

The Minutes  of the previous Meeting were  read  and  confirmed.  A Letter was  read 
from  Cit  Wolff stating  that  he  believed  the  CC  had  at  their  last  sitting  by  cancelling

as  a  Member of the  CC  tendered  his  resignation—The  Letter  was  discussed  and  Cit

against the  appointment  by  the  CC  of anyone  not  a  Frenchman  as  the  Delegate  to 
the  administration  in  Paris. 

15 

Cit  Marx  stated  the  protest  was  unnecessary  as  he  Cit  Marx  was  certain  that  Cit 
Schily  would  not  accept  the  appointment  if  there  was  the  slightest  opposition  to 
20  him,  it  was  against  Cit  Schily's  wish  that  he  had  been  elected,  The  President  sug 
gested the  re-opening  of the whole  question, this was  opposed  ||[38]|  by  Citizens  Ho 
well,  Kaub  and  Cremer, 

The following  Resolution  was  then proposed  by Cit Weston  seconded by  Cit Mor 
gan  and  Carried  Unanimously—That  the  CC  having  the  fullest  Confidence  in  Cit

session  and  hopes  that he will use  his great influence  to form a  Branch  in  France.

cussion  ensued  as  to  remarks  which  some  Members  of  the  CC  were  said  to  have 
15  given  utterance  to  viz  That while  they  asked  for Manhood  Suffrage  they were  quite 
prepared  to  take  anything  less.  The  impropriety  of  such  statements  was  unani

Cit  Fox  in  bringing  forward  this  Resolution  said  that  it  had  been  proposed  at  a 
former  sitting  to  thank  Cit  Schily  but  as  he,  Cit  Schily,  had  been  appointed  by  the 
CC  as  its  Special  Delegate  in  Paris  it  was  thought  by  several  Members  of the  CC 
that  his  appointment was  a  recognition  of the  services  he  had  rendered  and  a  proof 
of the  Confidence  the  CC  had  in  him,  but  now  that  Cit  Schily  no  longer  held  the  15 
position  as  Special  Delegate  from  the  CC  the  objections  to  thanking  him  had  lost 
their  force. 

The  Resolution  was  Carried  Unanimously.

The  Secretary  for  Switzerland  read  a  highly  encouraging  report  of the  prospects  of 
the Association  in  Switzerland,  which  he  had  received  from the  managing  commit 
tee  at  Geneva.  From  it  we  give  the  following  extracts:—"It  has  been  told  you  in  a 
preceding  letter  that  in  Switzerland  we  were  putting  our  shoulders  to  the  wheel  in 
propagating  the  idea  of the  total  and  universal  emancipation  of the  working  classes. 
What you  have  learnt  from  the  Hamburg  Northern  Star  about  our  enthusiasm  is  be-
ing  daily  confirmed  in  a  highly  reassuring  manner.  What  is passing  at  Geneva,  and 
the  letters  which  we  receive  from  all  parts  of  Switzerland,  are  a  warranty  that  our 
10  hopes will soon be realised on a vast scale.  I  am happy to inform you  that  at Geneva 
the  tum  affairs  are  taking  is  highly  favourable,  and that the  results  already  obtained 
are  satisfactory.  In  March  last  the  statutes  were  discussed  article  by  article,  and  ap 
proved  by  a  public  meeting.  At  that  which was  held  at  a  masonic  lodge  on  April  2, 
200  working  men  came  and  enrolled  themselves  as  members  of  the  International 
15  Association.  ...  We  venture  to  assure  you  that  the  hesitations  which  have  hitherto 
manifested  themselves  in  some  quarters  are  on  the  eve  of  disappearing,  and  that 
numerous  societies  will  come  to  swell  our  ranks  as  the  idea  becomes  more  widely 
known  and  better  understood.  The  association  has  taken  wonderfully,  not  in  one, 
but  in  various  parts  of  Switzerland.  All  the  affiliated  sections  have  seized  the  true 
spirit  of the  association  and  carry  its  banner  high."

T he  Compositors'  Strike  in  Leipsic. 

The  Secretary  for  Germany  read  the  following  important  communication  from  the 
Berlin  Compositors'  Union  in  relation  to  the  strike  of the  Leipsic  compositors: — 

"Berlin,  April  15. 

25  Respected  Citizen,—The news of the Leipsic  event—viz.,  the  printers'  and  compos-
itors'  strike  for  a rise  of wages,  will have  reached  London  as  well  as  the  other parts 
. 
of Europe.  Of  650  men,  mostly  compositors,  who  have  ceased  working  (150  have 
left  Leipsic)  500  are  still  on  strike.  Those  500  must  be  efficiently  supported,  if the 
first  great  trial  in  Germany  of the  working  men's  forces  is  to  end  in  triumph.  Our 
30  Compositors'  Association  have  adopted  the  Leipsic  straggle  as  their  own,  and  are 
ready  to  give  all  the  support  in  their  power.  From  their  small  means  they  have  al 
î 
ready  contributed  £150,  and  they  are  willing  to  do  more,  but  if restricted  to  their 
own resources  they  must  fail.  Other working  men's  societies,  especially those  of the 
larger  towns  where  the  working  class  self-consciousness  is  developed,  must  contri-
35  bute  their  mites.  The  undersigned  administrative  committee  addresses  you,  there 
fore,  dear  citizen,  and  calls  upon  you  to  induce  the  International  Working  Men's 
in 
Association,  and  especially  the  London  Printers'  Union,  to  interest  themselves  in 
the  straggle  of their  Leipsic  brethren  to  do  something  for  them,  to  make  subscrip 
tions  for  them.  But  time  presses,  and  'he  gives  double  who  gives  quickly.'  Deeply 

319 

The  Minute  Book  of the  Provisional  Central  Council  of the  I.W.M.A. 

penetrated  by  the  conviction  that  the  seemingly  petty  struggle  of the  compositors 
which  is  now  going  on  in  Leipsic—in  Leipsic,  so  to  say,  in  the  heart  of Germany, 
and  of Europe—is  of the  highest  importance  for  the  whole  European  working  class, 
and  that  even  if  such  were  not  the  case,  every  working  man's  movement,  every 
strike,  has  an  international  significance,  that,  in  fact,  the  immediately  and  locally 
engaged  working  men  do  battle  for  the  whole  of their  class;  that  the  bond  of frater 
nity  must  embrace  all  working  men,  and  that  the  Working  Men's  International 
Association  has  assuredly  risen  to  the  level  of this  idea.  We  hope  that  the  same  will 
do  their  best,  and  that  in  particular  our  English  colleagues,  the  compositors,  will 
not withhold  from their and our brethren the  necessary support.—The  Committee  of  10 
the  Berlin  Compositors'  Union.—By  order  of the  Committee,  B.Feistel."

It was  stated  that  a  collection  in  aid  of the  Leipsic  compositors  had  already  been 
made  in  an  affiliated  society  of the  International.  A deputation  of three  members  of 
the  council  was  appointed  to  wait  on  the  London  Compositors'  Society.

The  Pres  and  the  VP  being  absent,  Cit  Dell  was  voted  to  the  Chair. 

The  minutes  of the  previous  meeting  were  read  and  confirmed.  Cit  Fox  gave  re 
port  of deputation  to  Compositors,  on  behalf of the  Leipsic  Compositors,  it  would 
not  be  possible  for  that  Body  to  grant  any  money  for  a  period  of  3  months—the 
deputation  had  therefore  failed  in  their  effort.  Cit  Jung  hoped  we  should  devise 
some  means  of giving  support  to  them  as  the  loss  of  this  strike  would  have  a  de 
pressing  influence  on  the  Trades  of Germany  generally. 

Cit  Weston  gave  report  of deputation  to  Fur  Skin  Dressers,  they  appeared  with 
out  any  exception  to  be  in  a  pitiable  condition  but  they  had  courteously  received 
the  deputation  and  promised  to  further  consider  the  propriety  of joining  us, 

Cremer  gave  report  of  Sub  Committee. 
Cit  Fox  proposed  Jung  seconded  that  the  following  Resolution  recommended  by 

the  Sub  Committee  be  adopted— 

That  whenever  the  French  Secretary  shall  receive  Letters  from  any  Citizen  or 
Citizens  who  have  been  elected  by  Workmen  in their localities  and  who  are  anxious 
to  open  a  Branch,  That  he  be  empowered  to  reply  to  such  communication  and  ac 
cept  such  offers  without waiting  for  the  assembling  of the  CC,  but he  shall  report  all 
such  communication  to  the  CC  at  their  first  sitting  after  such  Letters  have  been  re 
ceived.  The  Resolution  was  Carried  Unanimously— 

Cremer proposed  Odger  seconded  That  Cit  Dupont write  to  the  Paris Administra 
tion  requesting  them  to  return  a  full  and  detailed  account  of income  and  expendi 
ture  up  to  the  time  of his  writing.  Carried  Unanimously— 

Cit  Fox  proposed,  Cit  Weston  seconded  That  the  following  ||[49]|  Resolution 
which had  also  been  recommended by the  Sub  Committee be  adopted,  also  that the 
remarks  of the  Sub  Committee  which  accompany  the  resolution  be  endorsed.  Car

the  Sec  of the  Greenwich  Branch  of the  Association—Lubez's  Letter  was  an  expla 
nation  of his  conduct  since  his  resignation  on  the  CC.  The  Letter  from  Greenwich 
announced  that  Cit  Lubez's  resignation  as  the  representative  of  the  Greenwich

in  which  two  statements  contained  in  Cit  Lubez's  Letter  were  denied 
1st  That  Cit  Lefort  had  first  conceived  the  Idea  of the  I.W.M.A.— 
2nd That  most  of the  French  Members  on  the  CC  had  resigned  in  consequence  of 
Cit  Lefort's  appointment  having  been  cancelled—the  fact  being  that  only  Cit  De 
noual  had  resigned  with  Cit  Lubez—on  the  termination  of  the  discussion  the  fol 
lowing  resolution  was  passed— 

That  it  be  suggested  to  Cit  Lubez  That  he  should  defer  presenting  himself at  the 
CC  for  confirmation  as  Delegate  from  the  Greenwich  Branch  untili  the  Sub  Com 
mittee  have  received  and  reported  on  the  Letter  he  addressed  to  Cit  Lefebvre." 

Cit  Fox  read  a  Letter  from  Cit Vinçard  who  had  been  appointed  on  the  Paris  Ad 
ministration,  stating  that  the  state  of his  health  would  preclude  him  from  accepting 
the  appointment,  also  expressing  his  best  wishes  for  the  success  of the  Association 
and  regretting  that  he  could  not  assist  to  make  it  so. 

Jung  proposed  Marx  seconded  That  the  Gen  Sec.  write  to  Cit  Vinçard  thanking 
him for his  past  services  and  hoping  that he  will  as  far as  consistent  with  his  health 
do  his  utmost  for  the  interest  of the  Association.  Carried  Unanimously. 

Cit  Marx  read  the  address  to  President  Johnson  in  reference  to  the  assassination 

of Abraham  Lincoln. 

Cremer  proposed  Weston  seconded  That  the  address  be  adopted,  written  on

form  League  as  its  Secretary  and  being  deputed  by  that  body  to  attend  said  confer

previous  meeting  which  were  confirmed. 

Cit.  Marx  stated  that  he  had  sent  to  the  New  York  Tribune  a  copy  of the  society's 
address  to  President  Johnson.  He  also  mentioned  that  there  had  been  an  immense 
public  meeting  in  Geneva  in  regard  to  the  assassination  of the  late  lamented  Presi 
dent of the  United  States;  that the  society's  correspondent,  Philipp  Becker,  had  spo 
ken  at  the  same,  and  remarked  upon  the  international  character  of the  meeting.

was  received  with  cheers  by  the  meeting.

firmed. 

Cit  Fox  in  the  absence  of Cit  [Dupont]  read  a  Letter  from  Lyons  stating  the  tulle 
manufacturers  were  endeavouring  to  reduce  the  wages  of their  operatives  giving  as 
their reason  for  so  doing  that  the  competition  with  the  English  Manufacturers  was 
so  keen  as  to  compel  them  so  to  act,  the  Letter  asked  for information  as  to  the  man 
ufacture  and  price  of  Tulle  in  England,  it  was  agreed  to  write  to  Nottingham  for 
said  information—

Council.  Cremer  proposed  Eccarius  seconded  That  in  case  Lefebvre's  Letter  (the 
absence  of which  had  induced  the  Council  to  suggest  to  Le  Lubez  the  propriety  of

The  Strike  of the  Makers  of Tulle  in  Lyons. 

The  Bee-Hive  Newspaper. 
Nr. 189, 27. Mai 1865 

: 

Cit.  Dupont,  the  Secretary  for France,  laid  before  the  council a  letter from the  asso 
ciation's  correspondent  in  Lyons,  from  which  the  reporter  extracts  the  following 
passages:—"I  have  delayed  this  communication  longer  than  I  otherwise  should,  on 
account  of the  meetings  which  have  been  held  by  the  various  trades  which  are  on 
strike,  and  principally  the  makers  of tulle.  The  manufacturers  of tulle,  induced  by 
one  of  their  number,  named  Baboin,  have  determined  to  diminish  the  wages  of 
their workmen,  alleging  that they  are  compelled so  to  act in  consequence  of English  10 
competition,  and  the  changes  that have  been made  in  the  Customs'  duties  in pursu 
ance  of  the  policy  of  free  trade.  The  first  point  is  denied  by  the  workmen,  who 
maintain  that  English  competition  does  not  amount  to  anything;  but  they  do  not 
give  a  satisfactory  explanation  on  this  point.  As  to  the  second  point,  touching  free 
trade,  no journal  is willing  to  insert  remarks  upon  this  question;  therefore  a  debate  15: 
has  not  been  able  to  take  place,  and  the  question—in fact, both questions—have re 
mained  in  the  dark,  especially  for  the  public.  In  the  interest  of the  working  classes 
of our  city,  it would  be  important  for  us  to  have  precise  information,  particularly  on 
the  articles  of tulle.  Try  then  to  collect  the  same  and  forward  it  to  us.  It  would  be 
well  to  know  the  cost price  of each  article  and  the  selling  price,  the  cost of transport  20 
within  and  without  England,  with  the  weights  and  measures  in  use  for  each  article, 
and  the  import  and  export  (sic)  duties.  Send  us,  as  quickly  as  you  can,  500  cards. 
We  have  printed  the  address  and  statutes,  and  are  confident  of success." 

It  was  resolved  that  communications  should  be  opened  with  persons  in  Not 

tingham  connected with  the  tulle  and  bobbinet  trade  by every member who had fa-  25 ¡ 
cilities  for  so  doing,  and  that  an  appeal  should  at  the  same  time  be  made  to  the 
public  to  supply  the  council  of the  association  with  the  required  information.

The  President  in  the  Chair. 

The  Minutes  of the  previous  meeting  having  been  read,  Jung  took  objection  to 
that  portion  of them  referring  to the  resolution  readmitting  Le  Lubez  to  the  CC  and 
stated  that  the  Resolution  had  not  passed  Unanimously  as  he  Cit  Jung  had  re 
mained  neutral,  a  fact  which  he  wished  recorded. 

5 

The  Sec  said  it had  been  his  practice when  no  opposition was  offered  to  the  pass 
ing  of a  resolution  to  record  it  as  being  Carried  Unanimously,  with  the  alteration 
suggested  by  Cit  Jung  the  minutes  were  confirmed— 

10 

The  Sec  read  communication  from  the  United  States  Legation  acknowledging 

the  receipt  of the  address  to  President  Johnson. 

Cit Weston  proposed Whitlock  seconded That Leon  Lewis  a  citizen  of the  United 
States  be  elected  a  Member  of  the  CC.  Carried  Unanimously.—Cremer  proposed 
Cit  Stainsby  be  nominated  as  a  Member  of the  CC. 

15 

fi 

The  Sec  introduced  the  question  of  Cards  of Membership.  Cit  Marx  proposed 
Whitlock  seconded  That  the  Sec  have  power  to  order  Cards  should  they  be  re 
quired.  Carried Unanimously. 

The  question  of the  proposed  international  Exhibition  was  then  discussed.  Cit 
Lucraft  stated  he  had  attended  one  of the  Meetings  and  had  informed  those  who 
20  were  moving  in  the  matter  of the  existence  of this  Association,  a  fact  of which  he 
found  they  were  previously  aware,  he  also  advised  them  to  communicate  with  the 
CC  but  for  some  reason  they  had  declined.  A  long  discussion  took  place  having  | 
J[5331  reference to  so  called  exhibition  of Working Men,  all who took part  in the  dis 
cussion  declaring  against  Mr  Coningsby  being  allowed  to represent himself as  at  the 

25  Head  of British Workmen. 

Citizen  Cremer  protested  against  the  selection  of Mr.  Coningsby,  as  British  Sec 
retary  to  the  Anglo-French  Committee,  as  being  calculated  to  alienate  from  the 
committee  the  sympathies  of British  Democrats. 

Citizen  Fox  observed  that  the  three  first  names  on  the  celebration  committee, 
30  namely,  Michael  Chevalier,  Emile  Ollivier,  and  Emile  Girardin,  were  not  in  good 

standing  with  the  French  Republicans. 

Citizens  Odger  and  Howell  held  that  Working  Class  Exhibitions,  both  national 

327 

The  Minute  Book  of  the  Provisional  Central  Council  of the  I.W.M.A. 

and  international,  were  being  patronised  by  the  wealthy  classes  at  the  present  time, 
partly  with  the  object  of diverting  the  attention  of the  working  classes  from  the  no 
bler  aim  of the  political  enfranchisement  of  their  class. 

Citizen  Marx  recommended  that  the  council  should  concentrate  its  efforts  upon 
promoting  the  success  of the  Working  men's  Congress  to  be  held  in  Belgium  this 
year. 

On  the  motion  of Citizen  Cremer  seconded  by  Whitlock  the  following  resolution 
was  passed:—"That  our  French  secretary  inform  the  Paris  Administration  that  Mr. 
Coningsby  is  the  avowed  enemy  of the working  classes  of Great  Britain,  and,  conse 
quently,  the  common  enemy  of  the  working  classes  of  Europe,  he  having  pro-  10 
claimed  in  the  columns  of the  Times  his  hostility  to  the  suffrage  being  extended  to 
the  bulk  of his  countrymen." 

| 

A  discussion  took  place  as  to  the  publication  of the  above  Resolution  but  on  the 
motion  of Cit  Cremer  seconded  by  Cit  Shaw  it  was  decided  by  11  votes  to  4  to pub 
lish  the  Resolution  and  an  epitomised  report  of the  proceedings— 

15  | 

It  was  then  agreed  on  the  motion  of  Cit  Dell  seconded  by  Fox  that  the  address 
and  Rules  of the  Association  be  printed  in  French,  Italian  and  German  leaving  to 
the  Sub  Committee  the  power  to  order  the  quantity  they  may  deem  necessary— 

Eccarius  proposed  Jung  seconded  That  Cit  Schily  be  requested  to  translate  the 

address  and  Rules  into  French,  Carried  Unanimously. 

20 M 

The  Sec  asked  whether,  as  no  reply  had  been  received  from  Lefebvre,  Cit  Le  Lu 
bez  was  to  be  notified  that he  was  at  liberty  to  take  his  seat  on  CC  as  representative 
of  Greenwich  Branch.  It  having  been  stated  that  some  further  difficulties  might 
arise  if Le  Lubez  came  to  the  CC  before  the  Letter  to  Lefebvre  was  produced,  Dell 
proposed  Worley  seconded  That  the  President  and  ||[54]|  Cit  Kaub  wait  on  Cit  Du-  25  '', 
pont  in  reference  to  the  matter. 
Carried,  1  voting  against. 
Citizen  Kaub,  as  a  deputy  from  the  German  Working  Men's  Mutual  Improve 
ment  Association  in  London  (Bildung's  Verein)  stated  that  that  body  had  been  in 
the  habit  of  commemorating,  by  a  public  meeting,  the  insurrection  of  the  30 ' 
24th June,  1848,  when the working  men  of Paris  were  barbarously  massacred  by  the 
soldiery  in  the  service  of the  middle  classes.  The  Bildung's  Verein  had  hitherto  re^ 
ceived  their  chief  support  on  this  occasion  from  their  own  members  and  French 
Democrats  in  London.  They  intended  to  repeat  the  commemoration  this  year,  in 
the  usual  manner,  and  hoped  for  a  wider  support  than  ever  from  Democrats  of all  35 -
nations. 

The  Sec  introduced  the  subject  of  a  journal  to  represent  the  Association  and 
stated  that  Cit  Leon  Lewis  was  about  to  bring  out  a journal,  a  long  discussion  took 
place  on  the  question  ending  in  the  following  resolution  and  amendment,  the  Reso 
lution  proposed  by  Cremer  seconded  by  Worley  That  a  deputation  of  3  be  ap-  40 
pointed  to  wait  on  Cit  Lewis. 

Amendment  by  Dell  seconded  by  Lucraft That  Cit  Lewis  be  invited  to  attend  the 

next  sitting  of the  CC.  Amendment  carried.

statement  in  regard  to  a  newspaper  which  he  contemplated  bringing  out,  said  Jour 
nal  would  be  of  the  most  democratic  character  and  he  had  no  doubt  of  its  being 
made  a  success;  it had  been  to  him  a matter of great  surprise  that  the Working  Men 
of Gt  Britain  had  no  Organ  which  faithfully  represented  their  interests,  he  thought 
it  quite  time  such  a  want  was  supplied.  Citizens  Marx,  Carter  and  Fox  agreed  as  | 
|[55]|  to  the  necessity  for  such  an  organ.  Citizen  Cremer  would  prefer  that  some 
control  should be  exercised  over such Journal by  a body  of Working  Men.  Cit Lewis 
would  have  no  objection  to  a  Committee  of advice  and  should  always  listen to  their 
counsel  and  advice. 

The  following  Resolution  was  eventually  proposed  by  Cit  Dell  seconded  by  Cit 

Jung  and  Carried  Unanimously, 

That  Cit  Lewis  send  to  this  Council  at  its  next  Meeting  the  exact  conditions 
upon  which  he  will  cooperate  with  this  Society  and  if this  Council  approve  of such 
it shall  name  any  number  to  cooperate  with Citizen  Lewis  meeting  at his  office  pe 
riodically, 

Cit  Marx  stated  that  when  Cit  Weston's  propositions  are  again  discussed  he 

should  read  a  paper  in  reply  and  propose  a  series  of Counter  Resolutions— 

The  Sec  stated  he  had  received  two  Letters  from  the  Greenwich  and  Deptford 
Branch  referring  to  Cit  Le  Lubez  and  his  relation  to  the  CC,  he  would  propose  that 
the  questions  involved  be  referred  to  the  Sub  Committee,  referred  accordingly. 

Cit  Dupont  read  a  communication  from  Paris  in  reference  to  the  Cards  of Mem 
bership  and  their  expenses,  the  Letters  and  their  contents  were  referred  to  the  Sub 
Committee. 

Cit  Fox  suggested  That  Hand  Bills  be  printed  and  distributed  broadcast  inviting 

Members  to  the  Association,  referred  to  Sub  Committee, 

Citizen  Lewis  being  asked  if he  knew  any  one  who  could  and  would  fill  the  Of 
fice  of Corresponding  Sec  for America,  stated  in  reply  he  should  have  no  objection 
to  filling  such  post;  on  the  [proposition]  of Cit  Dell  seconded  by  Cit  Eccarius  Cit

|[58]|  Central  Council Meeting  June  20th  1865 

VP  Eccarius  in  the  Chair. 

The  minutes  of the  previous  Meeting  were  read  and  confirmed.  The  Sec  read  a 
Letter  from  D  Bagnagatti,  the  Secretary  of the  Italian  Working  Men's  Association 
in  London  informing  the  CC  that  Cit  L.Wolff had  been  appointed  by  said  Associa 
tion  as  their  representative  on  the  CC— 

Cit  Fox  proposed  Cit  Weston  seconded  That  Cit  L.Wolff be  accepted  as  the  rep 

resentative  of  the  Working  Men's  Association,  Carried  Unanimously. 

Cit  Dupont  read  a  Letter  from  St  Denis  asking  for  300  Cards  of  Membership, 
he  also  requests  from  4  places  for  permission  to  open  Branches  of  the  Associa-  10 
tion. 

The  following were  then  elected Foreign  Corresponding  Secretaries:  Cit  Talbot of 
Caen, Cit Ferdinand Duhamel of Lisieux, Cit Ferret of Pantin, Cit Bosc of St Denis—pro 
posed  by  Cit  Marx  seconded  by  Cit  Weston. 

The  Council  having  had  their  attention  called  to  the  frequent  absence  of the  Fi-  15: 

nancial  Secretary—agreed  to  refer  the  question  to  the  Sub  Committee, 

Cit  Jung  stated  that  having  had  occasion  to  visit  the  Silk  Weavers'  Society, 
he  had  introduced  the  principles  of  the  I. W.  M. A.  and  he  believed  they  would 
join. 

Cit Fox  thought we  ought  to  take  immediate  steps  to  increase  our means  of prop-  20; 

agandism.  The  Sec  thought  it  would  be  well  to  defer  the  question  for  a  few  weeks, 
the  declaration  of enrolment  for  Societies  would  then  be  ready, 

Cit  Marx  then  read  a  part  of  his  paper  in  reply  to  Cit  Weston's  propositions  on 
the  question  of  Wages,  Cit  Weston  thought  that  in  the  part  of  the  paper  read  by 
Cit  Marx  that  nothing  had  been  advanced  or  proved  which  in  any  way  affected  the  25J 
principles  he  affirmed,  Cit  Cremer  thought  Cit  Marx  had  given  two  or  three  practi 
cal  illustrations  or  rather  facts  which  completely  destroyed  the  positions  affirmed 
by  Cit  Weston;  the  question  was  adjourned  till  June  27  at  9  o'clock.  Cit  Marx  will 
then  read  the  latter  part  of  his  paper  and  propose  a  series  of  counter  resolutions. 

Cit  Fox  reported  the  result  of his  and  Cit  Jung's  interview  in  the  presence  of Cit  30-

Le  Lubez  with  the  Members  of  the  Greenwich  Branch,  the  reasons  for  the  delay 
which  had  occurred  in  acknowledging  their  representation  having  been  explained, 

334 

Meeting  of the  Central  Council  June  20,  1865

The  Council  then  adjourned  to  June  27.

VP  Eccarius  in  the  chair. 

The  Minutes  of the  previous  Meeting  were  read  and  confirmed. 
The  report  of the  Sub  Committee  was  given  by  the  Secretary,-they  recommended 
that  as  Citizen  Whitlock  the  Financial  Secretary  was  so  often  absent,  that  another 
Citizen  be  elected  in  his  stead,  Citizen Whitlock  having  explained  the  cause  of his 
absence  and  stated  that  he  might  possibly  have  shortly  to  resign;  it  was  agreed  to 
waive  any  further  discussion  on  the  point  untili  after  the  present  quarter's  accounts 
had  been  audited. 

Citizen  Fox  called  the  attention  of the  Council  to  a  point  of order  at  a  previous 
sitting,  the  President had  allowed  two  Amendments  at  the  same  time  to  be  put to  a 
resolution,  this  he  Cit  Fox  contended  was  out  of order  and  in  this  opinion  he  was 
fortified  by  the  opinion  of  an  eminent  authority  which  he  quoted,  said  authority 
laid  it  down  as  a  rule  that  there  can  be  but  one  amendment  at  a  time  to  1  resolu 
tion,  when  that  is  disposed  of  another  may  then  be  proposed. 

Cit  Dupont  read  a  Letter  from  Citizen  Lisieux  accepting  the  position  as  Corre 

sponding  Sec  and  asking  for  500  Cards. 

Letter  also  from  Citizen  Ferdinand  Duhamel  also  accepting  position  as  Corre 
sponding  Sec,  another  Letter  from  Citizen  Ferret  of Pantin  also  accepting  position 
as  Corresponding  Sec,  he  asked  for  Cards  but  stated  that  he  did  not  expect  to make 
many  members just  now  as  there  was  a  dearth  of employment  and  consequent  dis 
tress  amongst  the  Workmen  but  when  prosperity  returned  he  believed  members 
would  join  the  Association. 

Citizen  Marx  then  after  recapitulating  the  principal  points  in  the  first  part  of his 
paper  which  he  had  read  at  the  last  sitting,  proceeded  to  read  the  latter  part  at 
the  conclusion  of which  Cit  Cremer  said  there  were  many  who  would  like  to  have  | 
|[60]|  both  papers—of Cit  Weston  and  Cit  Marx'  reply—printed,  but  he  hardly  knew 
how  the  expense  was  to  be  met. 

Cit  Weston  questioned  the  correctness  of the  statement  contained  in  Cit  Marx' 
paper having  reference  to  Agricultural  Laborers.  On  the  motion  of Citizen  Eccarius 
the  debate  was  adjourned  to  the  next  sitting  to  be  opened  by  Cit  Eccarius. 

The  Council  then  adjourned  to  July  4 t h.

was  made  in  reference  to  the  Continental  Corresponding  Secretaries;  the  Minutes 
were  then  confirmed. 

Cit  Fox  stated  that  the  ruling  of the  debate  in  the  House  of Commons  last Night 
had  confirmed  what  he  had  asserted  at  the  last  sitting  of  the  CC—he  also  stated 
that  he  had  not  been  able  to  obtain  the  requisite  information  as  to  the  manufacture 
of Tulle  but  he  hoped  the  Gen  Secretary  would  do  so  on  his  visit  to  Norwich, 

Cit  Dupont  had  received  a  Letter  from  France  which  he  thought  could  be  better 
considered  by  the  Sub  Committee,  referred  accordingly.  Cit  Jung  presented  the  As

chard  Cottam  gratuitously,  Cit  Marx  proposed  Cit  Cremer  seconded  That  the  CC 
thanks  Cit  Cottam  for  his  generous  gift.  Carried  Unanimously. 

Cit  Eccarius  resumed  the  adjourned  debate  on  Cit  Weston's  propositions  arguing 
against  Cit Weston's views,  Cit Fox  slightly  differed with  Cit Eccarius  as  to  the  con 
tinued  Intellectual  progress  which  Cit  Eccarius  asserted  had  been  made  by  Man 
kind.  Cit  Carter  altogether  ignored  the  statistics  of  Political  Economists  and  pre 
ferred  to  look  at  and  judge  Man  by  what  we  knew  of him,  Cit  Kaub  proposed  the 
adjournment  of the  debate  till  the  next  sitting.  Carried  Unanimously.  The  Council

Strikes  in  F r a n c e. 

Citizen  Eugène  Dupont,  the  Secretary  for  France,  has  addressed  from  London  the 
following  letter  to  the  editor  of the  Temps,  a  republican  paper  in  Paris: — 

5 

15 

"Mr. Editor,  I  have  read  in  your  report  of the  Senate's  proceedings  the  proposi 
tion  made  by  Baron  Charles  Dupin,  concerning  strikes  among  the  working  classes. 
In  so  important  a  question,  M.  Charles  Dupin  who  calls  himself  the  mentor  and 
friend  of the  working  classes,  finds  no  other  solution  for  the  difficulty  than  in  coer 
cive  measures,  by  appealing to the  terrors  of the  law,  doubtless  in  obedience  to  the 
10  proverb:  'The  wise  father  spareth  not  the  rod.'  Happily  the  ouvriers  are  no  longer 
overgrown  children,  who  are  scared  by  the  threat  of a whipping;  the  working  classes 
graduated  in  1848,  and  they  guide  their  steps  by  the  lessons  of the  past.  Convinced 
that  an  insurrection  would  only  aggravate  their  situation,  the  working  men who  are 
dissatisfied  with  their  condition  and  social  inferiority,  appeal  to  discussion,which  is 
the  true weapon  of progress.  This is why the fact that perfect order is  maintained by 
the  strikers  seems  so  strange  to  M.  Charles  Dupin,  the  'guide,  philosopher,  and 
friend'  of the  working  classes.  He  no  longer  knows  his  pupils  again.  What!  strikes 
follow  strikes,  and  not the  slightest riot—that  is  against the  order of nature.  Repeal, 
then,  without  delay  the  law  on  combinations.  What,  then,  would  M. Charles  Dupin 
20  have  said  if armed force had been  compelled to  intervene?  I  am far from saying  that 
a  strike  is  a  final  solution;  it  is  only  an  expedient  rendered  necessary  by  the  present 
relations  of  capital  to  labour.  But,  in  any  event,  nothing  can  be  achieved  without 
the  right  of meeting  and  free  discussion;  repressive  laws  may  adjourn  and  aggravate 
the  question,  but  not  resolve  it.  Late  events  have  demonstrated  to  the  least  observ-
25  ant that it is necessary to pay attention without delay to questions relating to the  or 
ganisation  of society.  It  is  with this  aim that the  International Working  Men's Asso 
ciation  has  been  established,  and  that  it  invites  every  working  man  in  Europe  to 
lend  a  hand  to  the  common  work.—Yours,  etc.,  E. Dupont."

a  s u m m o n ed  M e e t i ng  on  the  2 5th  of July  1865 

10 

In  consequence  of the  urgent  representations  of our  French  and  Swiss  correspond 
ents  who  call  upon  the  CC  to  take  some  steps  in  fulfilment  of the  pledge  given  at 
the  time  of  the  foundation  of  the  Association  that  a  Congress  would  be  held  in 
Brussels  in  the  present  Year  to  discuss  questions  of general  interest  to  the  proleta 
rians  of Europe,  your  Committee  have  taken  the  whole  subject  into  their  considera-  15 
tion  and  now  submit  to  you  the  following  series  of proposals 

1st  That  it  is  not  feasible  to  assemble  a  Congress  in  Brussels  or  London  at  the 
present  time,  in  lieu  thereof we  propose  a  Conference  which  shall  assemble  in  Lon 
don  on  Monday  September  2 5t h. 

2nd  That  the  following  declaration  be  published  in  the  Continental  and  British  20 

Journals  which  are  favourable  to  our  cause 

"The  Central  Council  of the  I.W.M.A.  announce  that they  have  resolved  on  post 
poning  the  convocation  of a  General  Congress  of Working  Men  at  Brussels  or  else 
where  for  three  reasons 

1 Because  they have felt  the  advisability  of having  a preliminary  Conference  with  25 

a  few  Delegates  from  their  principal  Branches  on  the  Continent  touching  the  pro 
gramme  which  ought  to  be  laid  before  the  said  Congress. 

2  Because  in Britain  the  Reform Movement,  the  ||[63]|  General  Elections  and  the 
Industrial  Exhibitions  and  in  France  the  Strikes  have  absorbed  the  energies  and  at 
tention  of the Working  Classes to  such  an  extent  as to have  retarded  the maturity of  30 ¡ 
the  Association. 

342 

Summoned  Meeting  of the  Central  Council July 25,  1865 

3  Because  during  the  present  Year  the  Belgian  Parliament  has  passed  an  Alien 
Act  of such  a  Character  as  to  put  an  end  to  the  project  the  Association  had  enter 
tained  of  holding  a  Congress  or  to  any  they  might  have  entertained  of  having  a  Con 
ference  in  the  Capital  of  Belgium." 

5 

3rd  The  Conference  is  to  be  constituted  in  this  wise:  two  Delegates  from  every 
Central Administration  are  to  be  invited,  also  two  from  Lyons.  The  cost  of the  trav 
elling  expenses  of the  Delegates  will  be  borne  by  their  constituents,  their  costs  in 
London  will  be  defrayed  by  the  Central  Council. 

10 

4th  As  to  the  ways  and  means  of  defraying  these  costs  the  Committee  have  re-
ceived  the  generous  offer  from  Cit  Jung  that  he  will  board  and  lodge  the  Delegates 
from  Switzerland,  for  the  rest  the  Committee  recommend 

1 That  the  Members  of the  CC  renew  their Annual  Subscriptions  in  the  month  of 

September  previous  to  the  Assembling  of the  Conference. 

2 That the  Gen  Sec be  instructed  to  appeal to  the  Secretaries  of the  Societies who 
15  have  already joined  the  Association  to  exert  themselves  to  sell  Cards  of Member 
ship  to  their  Individual  Members  for  the  sake  of Meeting  the  outlay  of the  Confer 
ence. 

3 That  the  Members  of the  CC  be  recommended  to  take  cards  on  sale,  paying  to 
the  Council the  amount  of the  same  in  ready  money,  recouping  the  immediate  out-
lay  from  ||[64]|  the  produce  of the  Sales. 

20 

5th  The  Committee  proposed  that  the  CC  should  adopt  and  submit  to  the  Confer 
ence  a  certain  programme  which was  amended  and  passed  in  the  following  form  by 
the  CC 

1  Questions  relating  to  the  Congress 
2  Questions  relating  to  the  organization  of the  Association 
3  Combination  of  effort  by  means  of  the  Association  in  the  different  National

finitive  sittings with  the  CC. 

7,b  On  the  2 8th  of September a  Soiree  will  be  held  for the  three  following  objects: 
1st  to  commemorate  the  founding  of the  Association,  2nd  to  do  Honour  to  the  Con-
tinental Delegates and  3rd  to  celebrate the  triumph of Federalism and Free  Labor in 
America.  The  Soiree  to  consist  of a Tea,  speaking,  conversazione  and  dancing  ... 

40 

In  reference  to  the  question  of the  Muscovite  Invasion  of Europe  Cits  Whitlock 
and  Merriman  argued  in  favor  of ||[65]|  placing  it  at  the  bottom  of the  programme; 
it being  a political  question  they would  prefer  to  keep  it  apart  from  the  others  which 

45  were  of a  social  character,  agreed to— 

343 

The  Minute  Book  of the  Provisional  Central  Council  of the  I.W.M.A. 

Cits  Weston  and  Leno  proposed  that  the  question  of Taxation  be  struck  out  not 
because  they  did  not  conceive  it  to  be  important  but  because  they  thought  the  pro 
gramme  sufficiently  extensive  without  it,  they  would  prefer  to  debate  one  or  two 
questions  thoroughly  rather  than  half  consider  a  large  number—3  only  voting  for 
the  amendment  it  was  declared  lost  and  the  question  of taxation  remained  part  of 
the  programme. 

As  an  addition  to  the  question  of Muscovite  Invasion  Cits  Merriman  and  Whit 

lock  proposed  the  following 

The  relation  of the  Papacy  to  the  political welfare  of Italy  and  the  civilisation  of 

the  World,  for the  addition  8,  against  12,  lost— 

5 

10 

Proposed  by  Cits  Lubez  and  Holtorp, 
That  the  question  of Education  as  embodied  in  the  French  programme  be  em 
bodied  in  the  programme  of the  C C,  for  6,  against  11  ( l o s t ).  The  majority  voting 
against  the  question  because  the  programme  was  already  sufficiently  extended. 

Cits  Cremer  and  Eccarius  proposed  that  the  question  of Standing  Armies  as  sug-  15 

gested  in the  French programme be  embodied  in ours.  For  12,  against  5  (Carried). 

Cits  Leno  and  Jung  proposed  That  the  question 
Cits  Cremer  and  Eccarius  proposed  That  at  the  Soiree  on  the  28 th  of  September 

next 

That  in  addition  to  celebrating  the  foundation  of the  Association  and  welcoming  20= 

the  Continental  Delegates  that  we  celebrate  the  triumph  of the  Federal  cause  and 
congratulate  the  American  People  on  the  abolition  of  Slavery,  Carried,  1  voting 
against. 

The  Programme  as  amended  and  altered  and  in  the  form  as  read  above  was  then 

put  from  the  Chair  and  Carried. 

25 ¡ 

The  Gen  Sec  stated  that  having  been  recently  in  Norwich  he  had  made  all  possi 
ble  enquiries  as  to  the  locality  where  tulle  was  manufactured  but  could  not  get  any 
information  on  the  subject  but  of this  he  was  certain  it  was  not  manufactured  in 
Norwich.  The  Council  then  adjourned  to  August  1Ά.

mended  1st  That  Citizen  Dell  be  elected  Financial  Secretary  in  the  place  of  Cit 
Whitlock,  agreed  to,  2nd  they  recommended  that  the  question  as  to  the  names  and

ting. 

Cit  Fox  read  some  correspondence  from  Neufchâteau  from  Lefebvre  the  corre 
spondent of the  Association  stating he  had  been  a  little  too  hasty  in the  opinions  he 
had  formed  with regard  to  the illegality of the Association  in  France,  he  was  glad  to 
find  he  had  been  mistaken  and  he  was  now  doing  all  he  could  to  push the  Associa 
tion  forward.  Cit  Fox  also  read  a  Letter from  Cit  Talbot  of Caen  who  also  stated  he 
was  using  his  utmost  exertions  on  behalf of the  Association, 

Cit  Fox  introduced  the  question  of  the  necessity  for  an  active  propagandism 
which  brought  about  a  long  discussion  taken  part  in  by  Cits  Jung,  Cremer,  Lubez 
and  Odger,  Eccarius  and  Wheeler,  the  latter  stating  he  had just  returned  from  Scot 
land  where  he  had  done  what  he  could  for  the  advancement  of the  Association  and

T he  good  work  in  N o r m a n d y. 

The  Secretary  for France  read  a  letter from  Edouard  Talbot,  at  Caen,  from  which we 
extract  as  follows:— 

20 

"My relations at Caen,  and  in the  department of Calvados,  as former President  of 
the Working  Men's Associations  until  1852,  allowed  me  to  profit by  the  rewakening 
of the  public  mind  to  propagate  the  excellent  ideas  of your  programme.  The  future 
belongs  to  them;  it  is  the  duty  of us,  the  workmen  of the  first  hour,  to  sow  them 
copiously  now,  even  in  the  dawn,  even  in  night  time.  Rely  then  upon  me,  as  on  a 
25  man  thoroughly  grounded  in  his  convictions,  who  has  never  either  changed  or  re 
coiled,  and  has  never  otherwise  understood  democracy  than  as  based  upon  socialist 
ideas.  You  ask me  if I  could  procure  the  insertion  of some  articles  in the journals  of 
the  department.  I  will  try;  but  I  do  not  expect  much  in  this  direction,  as  in  Caen 
there  are  only  two journals—and  one  is  clerical,  the  other  prefectoral.  In  the  other 
towns  there  exist only  advertising sheets. As to the  cards  of membership,  be  so good 
as  to  send  me  fifty.  I  cannot  dispose  of  them  all  immediately,  but  I  can  of 25  at 
least;  and  the  rest will go  off by  degrees.  Among the  people  of this  district  there  is  a 
general  desire  for  action;  they  suffer from  the  deadness  of the  last  15  years,  and  the 
younger  generation  begin  to  feel  the  want  of  a  'freer  life.' "

nated  Cit  Hrabje  as  a  Member  of the  CC. 

The  Secretary  introduced  to  the  notice  of the  CC  the  necessity  for  reconstituting 
the  Standing  Committee  as  there  were  Members  now  on  it  who  never  attended  its 
sittings,  it  was  agreed  to  adjourn  the  question  till  the  next  Meeting  of the  CC. 

Cit  Jung  read  correspondence  from  Switzerland  which  stated  they  were  making 
rapid  progress  with  the  Association,  several  Working  Men's  Societies  had  lately 
joined,  he  also  translated  for  Cit  Dupont  Letters  he  had  received  from  Lyons  and 
other  parts  of France  all  speaking  hopefully  of the  progress  they  were  making;  the 
Members  in  Lyons  again  asked  for the  information  they  had  before  sought  in  refer 
ence  to  the  prices  and  manufacture  of Tulle,  it was  agreed  to  make  another  effort  to 
get  the  information  desired.  The  Correspondence  was  received. 

Cit  Jung  who  was  entitled  to  open  the  adjourned  debate  on  Cit Weston's  question 
asked  for  permission  to  postpone  doing  so  till  the  next  sitting.  Cit  Leno  supported 
doing  so,  agreed  to.  The  Council then  adjourned  as  there  was  important business  to 
transact  connected  with  the  formation  of  a  Newspaper  Company.

The  Minutes  of the  previous  meeting  were  read  and  confirmed.  Letter  read  from 
Cit Richard  Cottam  acknowledging  the  thanks  of the  CC  and  expressing  his  willing 
ness  to  at  any  time  assist  in  the  progress  of the  Association— 

A  Letter was  also  read  from  Cit A.  Walton  a  Member of the Association  living  in 
Wales,  the  letter  stated  that he  had  the  previous  Week  sent  a Letter to  the  Bee-Hive 
headed  "The  Great Naval  Review  at  Cherbourg,"  ||[70]|  but  the  Editor ofthat  paper 
had  inserted  the  letter  as  a  Leading  Article  and  palmed  it  off  on  the  Readers  by 
using  the  Editorial  "We"  as  an  Editorial  production.  A  considerable  discussion 
took  place  on  the  matter,  all who  took  part  in  it  denouncing  such  conduct  and  the 
following  resolution  by  Cits  Eccarius  and  Marx  was  unanimously  agreed  to— 

That  a  copy  of  Cit  Walton's  Letter  to  this  Council  be  sent  to  the  Editor  of  the 
Bee-Hive  and  an  explanation  be  demanded  regarding  the  appropriation  of an  Arti 
cle  sent  by  Cit  Walton  to  the  Bee-Hive  on  Foreign  and  International  Politics.  Cits 
Howell,  Cremer  and  Eccarius were  appointed  to  prepare  an  answer to  Cit Walton. 

A  Letter  was  read  by  Cit  Jung  from  Cit  Leon  Fontaine,  the  letter was  referred  to 

Cit  Dupont. 

The  next  question  was  the  proposed  election  of  Cit  Brien  on  the  CC,  Cit  Shaw 
opposed  his  election  as  he  had  never  worked  in  harmony  with  any  body  of  Men 
with  which  he  has  been  connected.  Also  for  his  vacillating  and  coquetting  conduct 
during  the  late  advocacy  of the  advance  of wages  movement  and  for  his  want  of 
honest  conduct  in  conducting  the  same, 

Cit  Howell  thought  from  his  conduct  he  ought  not  to  be  elected. 
Cit Wheeler thought  if the  character  given  by  Cit  Shaw be  correct  it  would  not be 
worth  while  to  introduce  him  to  the  Council  as  he  might  introduce  discord  and 
thereby  weakness,  it  was  unanimously  agreed  not  to  elect  Cit  Brien— 

Cit  Hrabje  on  the  proposition  of Cits  Kaub  and  Lessner was  unanimously  elected 

a  Member  of the  CC. 

Jung  and  Bordage  nominated  Cit  Lucien  Perchelet  on  CC— 
The  question  of reconstructing  the  standing  Committee  was  adjourned.  Cit  Jung 
having  the  right  to  reopen  the  adjourned  debate  on  Cit  Weston's  proposition  asked

Meeting  of the  Central  Council  August 29,  1865 

that  the  question  might  again  be  adjourned  as  he  was  not then  prepared  to  open  the

/ [ 7 3 ]/ Meeting  of Central  Council  October  3rd  1865 

The  President  in  the  Chair. 

The  Minutes  of the  former Meeting  were  read  and  confirmed,  The  Sec  read  a  let 
ter  from  Cit  Jung  stating  his  inability  to  attend  the  Council  Meeting  as  he  had  an 
attack  of  Ophthalmia;  the  Council  expressed  a  hope  that  he  soon  be  with  them 
again— 

Letter  read  purporting  to  be  a  Letter  from  the  Editor  of the  Bee-Hive  but  as  no 

name  was  attached  to  it  the  Council  passed  to  the  next  business. | 

|[74]|  A  Letter was  also  read  from  Madam  Jeanne  Deroin,  the  letter  had  been  ad 
dressed  to  the  Conference  but  had  been  delayed.  The  Secretary  stated  he  had  re 
ceived  applications  for  the  address  and  rules  from  the  Hearth  Rug  Weavers'  and 
Gilders'  Societies. 

Morgan  gave  report of visit  to Boot-Closers,  it was very  late  before  the  deputation 

were  admitted but the  Members  of the  Society  apologised for having kept the  Depu 
tation  waiting  and  he  had  no  doubt  but  that  at  their  next  Monthly  Meeting  the  So 
ciety  would  join  the  Association. 

The  question  as  to  the  publication  of the  doings  at  the  Conference  was  then  dis 

cussed. 

Cit  Carter  and  Lubez  proposed  That  Cit  Marx  be  requested  to  compile  the  report 

of the  Conference  proceedings.  Carried  Unanimously. 

Cit  Carter  and  Lubez  proposed  That  a  Copy  be  sent  to  Citizen  De  Paepe  in  Bel 
gium  and  that  he  be  requested  to  publish  it  in  Pamphlet  form.  Carried  Unani 
mously. 

Cit  Dupont  reported  that  a  Friend  of  his,  Cit  Coraz  was  about  to  start  for  New 
York  and  he  suggested  that  Cit  Coraz  should  [take  with  him]  (as  he  was  willing  to 
do)  500  Cards  of Membership  and  addresses— 

Cit  Dupont  also  gave  notice  of his  intention  to  propose  Cit  Coraz  as  the  Corre 

spondent  of the  Association  in  New  York— 

A  discussion  took  place  as  to  the  late  Soiree,  the  numbers  attending  it  and  the j 
Tickets  taken  at  the  Doors;  an  explanation  having  been  given  the  subject  dropped. 

Several  Friends  came  and  took  their  Cards  of Membership. 
Cit  Bordage  nominated  Cit  H. Johnson  as  a  Member  of the  CC.

/ [ 7 4 ]/ Meeting  of CC  October  10 th  1865 

Cit  Weston  in  the  Chair,  the  minutes  of the  previous  Meeting  were  read  and  con 
firmed. 

Cit  Johnson  on  the  Propositions  of Cits  Bordage  and  Dell  was  elected  a  Member 

of the  CC,  Cit  Louis  Oborski  proposed  by  Bobczynski  and  Marx. 

Cit  Bobczynski  said  that  as  the  Polish  ||[75]|  association  was  at  present  consti 
tuted  they  could  not  well join  the  I.W.M.A.  but  they  wished  to  take  part  in  it  and  to 
send  representatives  to  the  CC,  he  also  stated  that  they  expected  to  be  able  to  effect 
the  opening  of Branches  in  Belgium,  France  and  Italy;  he  had  been  deputed  to  ask 
if the  Association  would  cooperate  with  the  Polish Association  to  celebrate  the  rev 
olution  of  2 9th  November,  the  question  was  adjourned  till  the  next  sitting. 

The  position  of Cit Lewis  the  nominal  Corresponding  Sec  for America  and  his  re 
lation  to  the  CC  was  then  discussed  and  the  Secretary  was  ordered  to  write  to  him 
informing  him  that  if he  did  not  attend  to  the  duties  of his  Office  that  his  election 
would  be  after  the  present  month  considered  void. 

Cit  Cremer  called  attention  to  the  Council  Meetings  and  gave  notice  of a propo 
sition  at  the  next  Council  Meeting  to  adjourn  the  sitting  for  a  Month—he  thought 
we had  too  many movements  in  hand  to  work  any  of them effectively  unless we  met 
less  frequently,  he  thought  all  our  energies  ought  to  be  directed  to  establish  the 
Workman's  Advocate,  for  without  an  Organ  the  Association  could  never  make  any 
great headway;  he  would  therefore  suggest  that  for the  next  two  or three  Months  the 
main  energies  of the  Council  should  be  directed  to  the  thorough  establishment  of 
the  Paper. 

A  discussion  took  place  in  reference  to  the  Polish  corresponding  Sec.  The  Gen 
Sec  said he  did  not  know  that  Cit  Holtorp had  ever done  anything as  a  Secretary,  he 
thought his position  as  Polish  Secretaryship  existed  only  in  name.  Several Members 
of the  Council  expressed  similar  views  after  which  the  Council  adjourned  till  Oc 
tober  17t h.

The  President  and  Vice  President  being  absent  Cit  Carter  was  voted  to  the  Chair. 
The  Minutes  of the  last  meeting  were  read  and  confirmed. 

Cit  Holtorp  in  reference  to  some  remarks  contained  in  the  minutes  of  the  last 
meeting,  explained  that  his  reasons  for  not  having  brought  any  correspondence  to 
the  CC  was  that  it  had  chiefly been  of a  private  character,  but  if the  CC  thought  he 
had  neglected  his  duty he  was  quite  willing  to resign  and  to propose  Cit  Bobczynski 
in  his  stead  who  had  large  connections  in  Galicia.  Cit  Bobczynski  thought  it  would 
be  better  to  allow  the  Poles  to  elect  their  Secretary. 

Cit  Lubez  thought  Cit  Holtorp  had  mistaken  the  views  of the  Council with  refer 
ence  to  his  having  neglected  his  duties;  the  subject  then  dropped  with  the  under 
standing  that  the  Polish  Association  should  recommend  to  the  CC  one  of  their 
Members  as  Secretary— 

Cit  Col.  Oborski  was  elected  a  Member  of  the  CC  on  the  proposition  of  Cits 

Bobczynski  and  Marx. 

The following were nominated  as  Members  of the  CC by  Cit Bobczynski:  Cit  Za-

bicki,  Cit  Werecki,  Cit  Krynski. 

Cit Lessner notified  to  the  Council the resignation  of Cit Bolleter as  a Member of 

the  Council. 

Cit  Bobczynski  stated  that  the  Polish  Association  had  decided  to  celebrate  the 
revolution  of  November  29  and  a  deputation  of  Poles  was  present  to  ask  if  the 
I. W. M. A.  would  assist  in  the  celebration. 

Cit  Lubez  feared  it  might  detract  from  our  prestige  if we  were  so  often  engaging 
in  demonstrations  with regard  to  Poland.  Cit Fox  thought we  ought  to  celebrate the 
Insurrection  every  Year,  he  differed  from  Lubez,  he  thought  the  taking  up  [of]  the 
Polish  cause had  already  done  the Association good,  it  had  brought us  a Number of 
Poles.  After  a  lengthy  discussion  the  following  resolution  was  adopted,  proposed  by 
Cits  Dell  and  Lessner, 

That  a  deputation  be  appointed  to  wait  on  the  Polish  League  to  ascertain  if they 
are  prepared to  cooperate  with us  in  the  demonstration  on behalf of the  Polish revo 
lution  of November  2 9t h. 

Cits  Dell,  Odger and  Eccarius  were  ||[77]|  appointed  as  the  deputation—Cits Fox 

358 

Meeting  of the Central  Council  October  17,  1865 

and  Marx  proposed  that  if  the  celebration  be  determined  on,  that  the  Standing 
Committee  shall  transact  all  the  business  in  connection  therewith.  Carried  Unan 
imously. 

The  General  Secretary  called  attention  to  the  fact  that  some  weeks  ago  he  had 
announced  his  intention  of  resigning,  he  could  no  longer  with  justice  to  himself 
perform  the  duties;  he  would  thank  the  Council  to  name  his  successor,  he  had 
asked  Cit  Lubez  to  accept  the  Office—Cit  Lubez  was  sorry  to  be  compelled  to  re 
fuse,  other  Members  of the  Council  were  appealed  to  but  all  declined;  but  some  of 
them  asked  Cit  Cremer  if he  could  not  longer  continue  the  Office. 

Cit  Cremer replied  that  to  him  it  was  a  question  of necessity,  he  had  sacrificed  so 
much  during  the  past  twelve  months  that  it  was  for  him  impossible  to  sacrifice  any 
more  but  he  would  consent  to  hold  the  Office  till  the  present  pecuniary  liabilities 
were  discharged—it  was  then  agreed  by  resolution  to  adjourn  for  a  fortnight. 

The  Council  then  adjourned  to  October  3 1s t.

/ [ 7 7 ]/  Tuesday  Oct'r  31 

Cit.  Dell  was  voted  into  the  chair.  The  Minutes  of the  last  meeting  were  read  and 
confirmed  without  alteration. 

Celebration  of  N o v 'r  29. 

Cit.  Dell  gave  a  report  of the  meeting  of the  deputation  to  Mr  Edmond  Beales.  Mr 
Beales  thought  all  public  demonstrations  at  the  present  time  inopportune,  but  the 
British  League  for  the  Independence  of  Poland  would  nevertheless  cooperate  with 
the  International  in  celebrating  the  insurrection  of  January,  23,  but  the  League 
would  not  take  part  in  any  celebration  of  ||[78]|  the  insurrection  of  1830. 

Cit.  Fox  asked  to  repeat what  he  had  said  at the  previous  meeting  that  the  insur 
rection  of Nov'r.  2 9t h,  1830  was  made  by  the  Poles  in  favour  of Europe  contrary  to 
their  own  former  plan  which  led  them  to  wait  for  the  Revolution  in  Germany, 
reaching  them  and  enabling  them  to  fight  out  their  own  independence.  But  when 
the  Czar  wanted  to  invade  Western  Europe,  the  Poles  being  intended  to  act  as  a 
vanguard  against  France  and  Belgium,  they  turned  round  on  Russia  before  their 
own  time  and  acted  as  a  shield  to  the  former. 

Le  Lubez  repeated  a  few  of  the  things  which  he  said  at  the  last  meeting:  He 
thought  that  this  Association  ought  to  occupy  itself with  resolving  social  problems 
and  the  extinction  of pauperism. 

Cit.  Carter  said  that  the  question  was  a  simple  one:  would  we  help  the  Poles  to 
celebrate  the  anniversary  of  the  most  unselfish,  the  most  Republican  movement 
that  ever  took  place  in  Poland.  On  the  motion  of Cit  Fox,  it  was  resolved  "That  the 
question  of the  celebration  of Nov'r.  29,  stand  over  until  we  hear  the  wishes  of our 
Polish  members."

Meeting  of the  Central  Council  October 31,  1865 

Courrier  I n t e r n a t i o n a l. 

Cit  Fox  read  an  article  from  the  International  Courier  (French  side)  criticising  the 
doings  of the  Conference  and  declaring  that  every  political  association  of working 
men  was,  under  present  circumstances,  a  conspiracy. 

The  sense  of the  article  and  the  spirit  in which  it was written were  thought by the 

meeting  to  be  highly  inimical  to  the  Association. / 

/[98]/  On the  motion  of Citizen  Cremer it was resolved  to  insert an  advertisement 
of the  International  Association  in  the  Workman's  Advocate,  on  the  terms  of pay 
ing the  price  of setting.  On the motion of the  same  it was  resolved  that the  members 
of the  Council  should  be  written  to  and  informed  that  henceforth  they  would  only 
receive  notice  of  the  sittings  of  the  Central  Council  through  the  Workman's Advo 
cate.  Citizen  Morgan  stated  that  the  deputation  to  the  bootclosers  did  not  attend  as 
they  were  detained  till  late  at  another  meeting  in  Chelsea.  Citizens  Werecki  and 
Krynski  were  unanimously  elected  members  of  the  Central  Council.  Citizen  Za-
bicki  was  objected  by  Citizen  Le  Lubez,  and  the  question  of this  election  was  ac 
cordingly  adjourned. 

The  Secretary  then  made  a  financial  statement:  He  stated  that  the  Association 
was £12  in dept; That M.  Dujoncquoy of the New York Hotel was the principal cred 
itor  to  the  extent  of £8  l is  8d,  that  he  was  pressing  for  payment;  that  the  Associa 
tion  was  also  indepted  to  Citizen  Jung  and  to  a  printer  named  Kelly  and  to  Citizen 
Kaub.  Per  contra  that  many  outstanding  accounts  were  due  to  the  Association  for 
tickets  sold  at  our two  soirees.  Citizen  Çremer also  thought that  ||[99]|  money  ought 
to be  forthcoming  from France,  as  the  Central  Council had  sent  over there  so  many 
cards  and  addresses  and  received  back  only  £4. 

The  meeting  then  adjourned  to  that  day  fortnight. /

The  Secretary for France  stated  that  the  report  of the  proceedings  of the  Conference 
drawn up by  the  Parisian  delegates  had been  inserted  in  all the  Republican  and  Lib 
eral journals  of Paris;  and  that  in  the  Siècle  M.  Henri  Martin  had  written  a  preface 
(see  below)  which  he  desired  to  read,  and  did  read  to  the  Council.  M. Martin  had 
joined  our  Association,  and  a  sudden  demand  had  sprung  up  for  cards,  1,000  of 
which  the  Paris  delegates  demanded  the  immediate  transmission.  He  also  stated 
that  the  Parisian  centre was  in  correspondence  with  Spanish democrats,  concerning 
which  they  would  communicate  at  length  to  the  Council  at  a  future  date.  He  con 
cluded  by  laying  the  aforesaid  report  on  the  Table.

Meeting  of the  Central  Council  November  14,  1865 

Polish  Celebration. 

Citizen  Bobczynski  stated  that  as  the  British  League  for  the  Independence  of  Po 
land  would join the International in  celebrating the  anniversary of the  late  insurrec 
tion  of January  23rd,  1863,  but  would  not join  to  celebrate  that  of November  29th, 
1830,  the  Polish  members  had  abandoned  the  idea  of asking  the  International  to 
observe  the  29th  instant.  Nevertheless,  the  Poles  in  London  intended  to  celebrate 
the  same  among  themselves  in  a  quiet  manner,  and  they  would  be  pleased  to  have 
the  company  of their friends.  When  the  arrangements  were  completed  notice  would 
be  given  of  time,  place,  etc.,  in  the  columns  of the  Workman's Advocate.

The  Lessee  of the  premises  demands  £12  per  ann.  for  the  front  and  £10  per  ann.  for 
the  back  room,  a  month's  rent  in  advance  and  a  monthly  notice  on  either  side.  As 
the  Council  desired  ||[80]|  to  have  as  large  an  attendance  of members  to  consider 
this  question  of location  as  possible,  resolved  to  let  the  matter  stand  over  till  next 
15  Tuesday.  This  question  was  accordingly  made  the  order  of  the  day  for  the  next 
meeting.  A  conversation  ensued  about  the  expediency  of  resuming  our  weekly 
meetings  and  a  resolution  to  do  so  was  carried  nem. con. 

The  Council  then  adjourned  till  Tuesday  next. 
The  following  document  was  ordered  to  be  inserted  in  the  minutes. 

20 

Henri  Martin's  preface 

to 

the  French  delegates'  Report. 

We  have  read  the  narrative  of what  lately  took  place  at  London  with  profound  emo 
tion.  We  have  a  presentiment that  something  great  has just  been begun,  and  that  St. 
Martin's  Hall  will  be  famous  in  history. 

The  elevation  of the  sentiments  and  the  language  of this  report,  the  breadth  of 
25  view  and  the  high moral,  political  and  economical  conceptions  which  have  decided 
the  choice  of questions  composing  the  programme  for  the  International  Congress  of 
Working  Men,  which  is  to  assemble  next  year,  will  strike  with  a  common  sympathy 
every  friend  of progress,  justice,  and  liberty  in  Europe. 

30  following 

Leaving  to  our  friends  and  coadjutors  the  task of studying  it  in  its  details,  and  of 
in  its  course,  this  new-bom  effort  of  European  fraternity,  we  will  only 
draw  attention  from  among-  such  profound  social  questions  as  "The  labour  of 
women  and  children  in  factories  from  the  moral  and  sanitary  point  of view,"  "The 
reduction  of the  hours  of labour;  object  and  moral  consequences  of the  same,"  "Re 
ligious  ideas,  their  influence  on  the  social,  political,  and  intellectual  movement," 
We will only, I  say,  draw  attention to  the ninth question laid  down for the  considera-
tion  of the  future  congress.

"The  necessity  of annihilating  Muscovite  influence  in  Europe,  by  the  application  of

the  principle  of the  right  of nations  to  dispose  of themselves,  and  the  reconstruction 
of  Poland  upon  a  democratic  and  socialist  basis."  We  will  take  the  liberty  of  re 
marking  that  the  expression  "democratic  and  socialist  basis,"  is  a  very  simple  one 
as  regards  Poland,  where  the  social  framework  needs  reconstruction  quite  as  much 
as  the  political  framework,  and  where  this  basis  has  been  laid  down  by  the  decrees 
of the  anonymous  government of 1863,  and  accepted by  all  classes  of the nation. | 

|[81]|  This  then  is  the  reply  of true  socialism,  of social  progress  in  harmony  with 

justice  and  liberty,  to  the  advances  of the  Communist  despotism  of Muscovy. 

This  "secret  of the  people  of Paris,"  which  our  friend  Corbon  has  revealed  in  his 

noble  book,  is  becoming,  then,  the  common  secret  of the  peoples  of Europe. 

We  were  well  persuaded  that  this  cold,  as  of death,  which  is  spread  over  the  sur 
face  of our  modem  society,  had  not  reached  to  the  bottom,  had  not  frozen  the  soul 
of the  people,  and  that  springs  of life  were  not  exhausted. 

It was  in  England  that  the  rich  and  powerful  gave  but  yesterday  the  most  melan 
choly  examples  of  international  egoism  and  of  indifference  to  the  lofty  duties,  to 
the  grand  interests  of  European  society. 

It  is,  indeed,  in  Britain  that,  for the  honour  of the  British  people,  these  noble  re 
prisals  of Young  Europe  ought  to  commence;  it  is  thither these  clasped  hands  must 
go  and  plant  the  flag  of the  fraternity  of peoples. 

"Let  those  who  have  faith  march  forward,  and  soon  the  sceptics  will  run  after 

them."* 

Our  ears  had  grown  unused  to  such  words;  they  thrill  us  to  the  depths  of  our 

heart. 

Henri Martin. /

/ [ 8 1 ]/  Minutes.  Tuesday,  Nov'r.  21. 

Citizen  Shaw  in  the  Chair. 

The  minutes  of the  previous  meeting  were  read  and  confirmed  without  alteration. 
A  letter  dated  Nov'r.  7  was  read  from  the  Secretary  of the  Council  of the  Cord-
5  wainers' Association  asking  for some  rules  and  addresses  to  be forwarded  to  Branch 

Societies  at  Birmingham. 

It was  ordered  that  Citizen  Fox  should  forward  24  copies  to  Thos.  Hallam  of No 3 
Second  Court,  Latimer  St.,  Birmingham  for  distribution  among  the  four  Branch  So 
cieties  in  that  town;  also  that this  remittance  should  be  accompanied  by  a  letter ex-

10  plaining  the  cause  of the  delay  which  had  arisen  in  responding  to  the  appeal. 

The  Secretary  for  Germany  stated  that,  in  view  of the  ||[82]|  sudden  demand  for 
cards  that  had  arisen  at  Paris,  he  and  the  Sec.  for  Switzerland  had  guaranteed  the 
printer  for  the  cost  of preparing  2,000  cards,  of which  number  1,000  should  be  sent 
to  Paris,  500  reserved  for  the  French  Provinces  and  100  reserved  for  Germany.  He 

15  desired  the  sanction  of the  Council  to  this  arrangement. 

It  was  moved  by  Cit.  Morgan  and  seconded  by  Wheeler  and  carried  nem.  con., 
"that we sanction the  arrangement made by  Cits.  Marx  and Jung with the  Printer of 
the  cards  and  that  the  allotment  of them  be  as  proposed  by  Cit.  Marx." 

G e n e r al  Report. 

20  Cit.  Marx stated that  on his  proposition it had  been resolved  at the  Conference that 
a Report  should  be  drawn up  of the  transactions  of the  Association  on  the  first  year 
of its  existence.  He  ||[83]|  now  advised  that  the  resolution for  preparing  such Report 
be  rescinded  on two  grounds:  (1)  because  the French delegates had  already publish 
ed  a  Report,  (2)  that  its  publication  at  the  present  moment  was  not  opportune  and 
25  should be delayed until May.  He had,  however,  communicated copies of the resolu 

tions  and  programme  to  our  Correspondents  in  Belgium  and  to  Cit.  Jung. 
The  resolution  for  drawing  up  a  Report  was  accordingly  rescinded.

The  Minute  Book  of the  Provisional  Central  Council  of the  I.W.M.A. 

P r o p a g a n da  in  G e r m a n y. 

The  Sec.  for Germany  said  he was  glad to  be  able to  report that our Association was 
at  length  making  headway  in  Germany,  where  it  had  obstacles  to  overcome  greater 
than  those  which  existed  in  France.  Steps  were  being  taken  to  form  ||[84]|  branches 
in  Berlin,  Mayence  and  Leipsic  by  men  for  whom  the  speaker  could  vouch.  These 
Societies  would  probably  be  represented  at  the  Geneva  Congress. 

5 

N ew  Correspondents. 

Cit.  Marx  proposed  that  Dr.  Coullery  of  Chaux-de-Fonds  in  the  Canton  of  Neu-
chatel  be  nominated  Correspondent  of this  Association  and  receive  a  letter  of cre 
dence.  This  proposition  was  carried  nem. con. 

10 

The  Sec.  for  France  proposed  that  Léon  Toutain  of  Condé-sur-Noireau,  in  the 

department  of  Calvados,  be  appointed  Correspondent.  Resolved  accordingly. 

Letter  from  Lyons. 

The  Sec.  for  France  read  a  letter  from  our  correspondent  at  Lyons  stating  that  he 
held  200  francs  at our disposal and would  shortly transmit same,  also  ||[85]|  desiring  15 
to  know  if  the  report  of  the  Paris  delegates  was  accurate  in  every  respect  or 
"Cooked"  so  as  not  to  offend  the  Government,  also  thanking  the  Council  for  the 
transmission  of the  Courrier  International  and  desiring  the  largest  possible  amount 
of information  concerning  the  doings  of  the  Central  Council. 

Location.

The  Council  agreed  with  Mr.Corbett  to  take  the  back  room  at  18  Greek  St.,  Soho, 
for  Tuesday  nights  at  4s.  a  week  payable  in  advance,  with  a  month's  notice  on 
either  side. 

Celebration  of the  2 9th  Nov'r. 

On  the  motion  of  Cits  Fox  and  Wheeler  it  was  resolved  that  should  the  Poles  in  25 
London  carry  out their project  of celebrating  this  event by  a  dinner,  those  members 
of the  Council  who  should  attend  the  same  be  authorised  to  do  so  as  a  deputation 
from  the  Central  Council.

President  Odger  in  the  Chair. 

The  minutes  of the  previous  meeting  were  read  and  confirmed  without  alteration. 

T he  Treasurership. 

Cit.  Dell  stated  that  he  and  Cit.  Wheeler  had  spoken  together  about  the  Treasurer-
ship  which  the  latter  was  willing  to  resume  and  the  former  desirous  of resigning  in 
consequence  of  the  distance  of  his  abode  from  town.  He  stated  that  Wheeler's  of 
fice  was  in  a  central  place  near  the  Strand  and  recommended  the  transference  of 
the  office.  It  was  moved  by  Howell  and  seconded  by  Dell  that  Wheeler  resume  the 
office  of Treasurer  of the  Association.  Carried  nem. con. \ 

I [87] I Switzerland. 

In  the  regretted  absence  of  the  Sec.  for  Switzerland,  Cit.  Marx  stated  that  Cit. 
J. Ph. Becker  had  issued  a  proclamation  to  the  German  Swiss,  concerning  the  Asso 
ciation,  portions  of which  he  thought  should  be  translated  and  published  in  our  re 
port.  In  it  it was  announced  that  the  Branch  Societies  in  Switzerland  were  about  to 
issue  a  paper  in  German  and  French  which  would  be  the  organ  of the  Association 
in  that  country. 

T he  tulle  question. 

The  Secretary  for  France  stated  that  it would  have  a  good  effect  on  the  Lyonnese  if 
any  member  of the  Council  could  procure  the  desired  information  concerning  the 
wages  earned  by  English  operatives  in  this  branch  of manufacture.  |

The  Minute  Book  of the  Provisional  Central  Council  of the  I.W.M.A. 

I[88]preparations  for  Congress. 

Cit.  Fox gave  notice  that  he  intended  to  prepare,  against the  forthcoming  Congress, 
a  paper  on  the  9  th  question  of  the  programme,  relating  to  Poland,  which  would  ad 
dress  itself to  the  merits  of the  question  and  to  the  necessity  of its  retention  as  one 
of  the  aims  of  the  Association.  He  intended  to  get  it  translated  into  French  and 
hoped  to  lay  it  in  English before  the  Central  Council  by  the  first Tuesday  in April. 

The  Council  then  adjourned. |

|[89]|  Dec'r.  19,  1865. 

Vice-President  Eccarius  took  the  Chair. 

The  minutes  of the  previous  Meeting  were  read  and  confirmed. 

T he  M i n u te  Book. 

Cit.  Fox  brought  before  the  Council  the  unregistered  state  of  the  records  of  our 
three  last  meetings  and  begged  that  the  Council  would  take  action  therein. 

After  some  conversation  Cit.  Dell  moved,  Lessner  seconded  and  carried 

nem. con., 

"That  Cit.  Fox  address  a  letter  to  the  late  Secretary  requesting  him  to  leave  with 

Mr. Corbett  the  Minute  Book  of the  Meetings  of the  Central  Council." 

C h a n ge  of  location. 

President Odger stated  that  a room could be had  in  Bouverie  St.  for £10 per  annum, 
that  its  expenses  might be  shared  with  the  Workman's Advocate  Company.  A general 
feeling  was  expressed  that  it  was  highly  desirable  that  the  Association  should  pos 
sess  a  continuously  accessible  location.  Citizen  Dell  was  appointed  to  make  the 
necessary  arrangements  with  the  Industrial  Newspaper  Company  for  taking  this 
room. 

Secretaryship  a nd  the  Cards. 

In  consequence  of the  vacancy  of the  office  of General  Secretary  to  the  Association 
and  the  difficulty  of  getting  the  cards  of  membership  stamped  which  had  arisen 
therefrom,  it  was  resolved  on  the  motion  of Citizen  Marx  that  henceforth  the  Con 
tinental  Secretaries  would  stamp  their  own  ]][90]|  cards,  that  the  said  cards  should 
not  be  numbered  and  that  the  said  Secretaries  should  give  receipts  only  for  the 
gross  number  of the  cards  they  received. 

371 

The  Minute  Book  of the  Provisional  Central  Council  of the  I.W.M.A. 

Cit.  Fox  repeated  the  assurance  he  had  formerly  given  that  it  would  be  impossi 
ble for him to  accept the  office  of Secretary.  Cit.  Dell then mentioned  the  name  of a 
friend  of his  who,  he  thought,  would  be  willing  to  undertake  the  office.  It  was  ac 
cordingly  agreed  to  adjourn  the  question  of electing  a  Secretary  until  Dell  had  spo 
ken  with  his  friend. 

C o n t i n e n t al  Correspondence. 

Cit.  Marx  stated  that  Societies  in  Basle  and  Zurich  had  joined  the  Association. 
Also  a  Benefit  and  a  Cooperative  Society  connected  with  the  Association  had  been 
formed  whose  seat  was  in  Geneva. 

Cit  Dupont  read  a  letter  from  our  correspondent  at  Condé-sur-Noireau,  Calva 
dos,  dated  Dec'r.  6,  complaining  that  he  had  not  received  any  cards.  Also  one  from 
Cits  Limousin  and  Fribourg giving  reasons why they  had not  sent money to  London 
for  the  cards  and  asking  that  full  confidence  and  entire  liberty  be  accorded  to  them 
until  the  Congress. 

The  Propaganda. 

Cit.  Jung made  an appeal to the British members  to  be up  and  doing to  collect mon 
ey  for  the  Congress  and  declared  that  the  dolce far  niente  of  the  British  members 
paralysed  his  efforts  among  his  own  countrymen  in  London  and  Switzerland. | 

|[91]|  President  Odger  observed  that  working  men's  spare  political  energies  were 
absorbed  in  the  agitation  for  Manhood  Suffrage  and  the  Ballot.  Cit.  Fox  replied 
that  the  reawakening  of political  life  among  the  London  masses  was  a  symptom  of 
favourable  augury  for  the  Association.  He  was  ready  to  address  a  Trade's  Society 
once-a-week  for the  purpose  of collecting  money  for the  Congress.  Cit.  Morgan rec 
ommended  that  Addresses  should  be  furnished  to  the  Trades'  Societies  before  any 
deputation  was  heard,  in  order  that  those  bodies  might  be  forewarned  and  have  the 
subject  in  their  programme  for  the  evening.

Finally  Cit.  Odger  undertook  to  prepare  a  list  of the  Societies  which  it  would  be 

most  advisable  to  apply  to. 

Standing  C o m m i t t e e. 

Cit.  Jung  moved  that the  Standing  Committee  resume  its  sittings,  but  on the  State-  30 
ment of the  Chairman that this was  a point  to  be  settled  by  the  Standing  Committee 
itself,  the  mover  withdrew  his  motion./

Present  Cits  Shaw,  Marx,  Jung,  Cremer,  Fox,  Le  Lubez  and  a friend  introduced  by 
the  last  named  as  a  member of the  newly  formed  French branch  of the Association. 
Cit.  Shaw  was  appointed  Chairman.

The  minutes  of the  previous  meeting were  read  and  confirmed,  a  slight  alteration 

being  made  in  the  last  paragraph  of the  same. | 

|[92]|  T he  n u m b e r i ng  of  the  Cards. 

that  the  Council  should  reconsider  their  resolution  of 
Cit.  Cremer  thought 
Dec'r. 19,  in  reference  to  the  non-numbering  of the  cards.  He  argued  that  the  num-
10  ber  was  a  protection  against  fraud.  New  cards  should  be  issued  Every  year  with 

fresh  numbers. 

After  some  discussion  Le  Lubez  moved  and  Marx  seconded  that  the  Cards  just 
obtained  from  the  printer  be  numbered  by  the  "numerical  printing  machine."  Cit. 
Cremer  having  undertaken  to  look  after  that  matter  on  the  following  day,  the  mo-
tion was  carried  unanimously. 

15 

Stamping  of  Cards. 

Cremer  thought  the  stamps  should  be  fixed  at  the  new  room  in  Bouverie  St.  where 
any  correspondent  could  use  it.  That  was  a  better  arrangement  than  having  it  in 
anybody's  private  dwelling.  He  made  a  motion  that  it be  fixed  in  Bouverie  St.  Sec-

20  onded  by  Jung  and  carried  unanimously. 

373 

The  Minute  Book  of the  Provisional  Central  Council  of the  I.W.M.A. 

R o om  in  Bouverie  Street. 

Cremer reported  that  the  Industrial  Newspaper  Company  had  taken  a  room  in  Bou 
verie  St.  at the rent of £ 10 per annum and was willing to admit the Association as  a 
co-tenant  and  sub-tenant  at  the  rent  of  £5  per  annum.  Cremer  proposed  that  we 
close  with  this  offer.  This  proposition  was  carried  unanimously. | 

I [93] I A u d it of A c c o u n t s. 

Cremer  introduced  the  subject  of the  audit  of our  accounts.  He  recommended  that 
the  next  audit  include  down  to  the  1ST  Jan.  1 8 6 6.  A motion  to  this  effect was  made 
and  carried. 

Raising  of  F u n ds  for  t he  Congress. 

Fox  thought  that  the  remarks  of the  Sec.  for  Switzerland  at  our  last  meeting  ought 
to  be  heeded.  He  had  accordingly  drawn up  an Appeal  to  the  Workingmen  of Great 
Britain  which  he  proposed  to  issue  in  the  name  of the  British  members  of the  Cen 
tral  Council  and  which  should  be  printed  and  sent  round  to  the  Trades'  Societies 
before  receiving  a  deputation  from  the  Council.  He  then  read  the  Address. 

Cremer  then  delivered  his  opinions  on  the  mode  of  raising  the  funds  required 
and  on  the  Address.  He  pledged  himself to  exert  his  influence  to  raise  them.  An 
address  should  be  printed  in  circular  form  and  sent  to  the  Trades'  Societies  in  suffi 
cient  numbers  to  allow  of  their  being  delivered  to  every  individual  member.  An 
address  merely  sent  to  the  Chairman  would  not  reach  or  act  upon  the  members. 
Also  subscription  lists  should  be  printed  with  a  notification  that  the  receipts  would 
be  acknowledged  in  the  Workman's Advocate.  The  address  of Fox was  referred  to  the 
Standing  Committee  which  appointed  Sunday  at  2 . 30 p.m.  in  Cleveland  Hall  Cof 
fee-Room  to  assemble. | 

I [94] I J o u r n al de Verviers. 

Cit.  Le  Lubez  laid  on  the  table  the  first  of a projected  series  of attacks  on  the  policy 
of the  Central  Council  published  in  the  Journal  de  Verviers  (Belgium). 

Cit  Marx  made  some  observations  in  defence  of the  Council.

State  prisoners  in  Ireland. 

5  Fox  read  from  the  "Cork  Daily  Herald"  the  Appeal  of Mrs. O'Donovan  Rossa  and 
Mrs. Clarke  Luby  to  the  women  of  Ireland  for  funds  for  the  families  of  the  State 
prisoners  now  or  lately  in  Ireland  and  also  evidence  from  the  Dublin  Irishman  that 
collections  were  ||[95]|  being  made  for  this  purpose  in  the  manufacturing  towns  of 
the  North  of  England.  He  remarked  on  the  liberty  granted  by  the  British  Govern-
10  ment  to  Irishwomen,  who  were  allowed  to proclaim  themselves  Fenians  without  be 
ing  prosecuted.  He  finished  by  moving  that  the  Appeal  be  sent  to  the  Workman's 
Advocate  by  the  Central  Council  with  a  request for  its  publication.  This  motion  was 
seconded  by  Weston,  who  thought  Ireland  had  been  as  much  oppressed  as  any  of 
the nations  on  the  Continent with which  Englishmen  were  wont to  sympathise  and, 
although he was something of a moral force man,  yet he was beginning to  think that 
unless  moral  force  had  some  physical force  in the  background,  it was  "perfect weak 
ness."  Motion  carried  unanimously.

Organ  for  F r e n ch  Switzerland. 

Fox  gave  a  summary  of the  contents  of the  Journal  of the  International Association

Dell  said  that  it  reflected  great  credit  on  the  workingmen  of Geneva  who  had  got 
up  such  a  creditable  performance  in  a  small  town  and  unaided  by  the  middle  class. 
Such  facts  were  very  encouraging.  He  moved  that  "the  Central  Council  having  read 
the  first  number  of the  said  Journal  express  their  high  approbation  of its  character 
25  and  contents  and  beg  to  accord  to  the  Conductors  their  best  wishes  for  its  perma 

nent  success." 

The  above  motion  was  seconded  and  carried  unanimously.

Le  Lubez  laid upon  the  table  two  copies  of the  ||[96]|  Echo  de  Verviers,  one  of which 
contained the conclusion of the  attack on the Central Council mentioned in the min 
utes  of the  last  meeting;  the  other  contained  a  copy  of the  proposed  Constitution 
of the Association which would be submitted by  the  First Branch of the Association 
in  London  to  the  Central  Council  and  possibly  afterwards  to  the  Geneva  Congress. 
Le  Lubez  observed that he  did  not represent  the  First Branch  on  any  official  capac 
ity,  but he was  a member of the  same.  The  Branch thought  that  any  body who  came 
to  the  Congress  with  well  digested  ideas  and  a  cut  and  dried  plan  would  have  a 
great  advantage  over those  who  went there  in  a fog  or like  the  foolish virgins  of the  10 ' 
Parable,  without  oil  in  their  lamps.

The  Constitution  was  then  read  by  Fox  in  English  but  the  translator  excused 
himself from  reading  the  second  part  of the  attack  as  the  first  part  was  not  then  in 
the  room. 

A p p e al  for  F u n ds  to  the  British  Democracy. 

15 

Fox  stated  that  the  Standing  Committee  had  met  on  Sunday  afternoon  and  had 
considered  his  proposed  Appeal;  that  Cremer  had  then  stated  that  he  thought  he 
could  produce  one which  if not  so  well composed would  tell  better with the  working 
classes  and  obtain more  funds;  that he would produce  an  appeal on Tuesday.  Under 
those  circumstances  the  Committee  agreed  to  report  both  appeals  to  the  Council,  20 
leaving  the  larger  body  to  select  the  one  best  suited  to  the  occasion.  The  Standing 
Committee  also  recommended  the  two  following  methods  of agitating  the  working 
classes  for the  aforesaid  object,  viz,  1.  That  ||[97]|  Subscription  sheets  should  be got 
up  and  distributed,  in  which  it  would  be  stated  that  all  monies  would  be  acknowl 
edged,  in  the  Workman's Advocate.  (2.)  That whichever appeal be  accepted,  it be  cir-  25 
culated  with  the  Address  and  mies  of the  Association  and  in  sufficient  numbers  to 
reach  individual  members  of the  Societies.  That  as  there  were  not  sufficient  num 
bers  of the  Address  in  print  to  meet  this  exigency,  it  would  be  necessary  to  ask  the 
Directors  of the  Workman's Advocate  to  reprint  it  in  that  Journal  and  so  bring  out  a 
new  edition. 

30; 

Fox  and  Cremer  then  read  their  respective  appeals.  Jung  demanded  that  the 
Council  should  first  decide  about  the  reprinting  of the  Address.  Howell  moved  and 
Jung  seconded  that  the  Directors  be  requested  to  reprint  the  Address  of the  Asso 
ciation.  This  motion  was  carried  after  discussion,  with  one  dissentient. 

1 
A  general  discussion  then  ensued  on  Cremer's  and  Fox's  Appeal.  Eventually  3'  ; 

Cremer's  was  preferred  by  a  vote  of 6  against  5  (one  neutral). 

It  was  then  unanimously  voted  that  Fox  be  requested  to  recast  his  Appeal  in  the 
shape  of a  leader with  certain  suggested  additions  for publication  in  the  Workman's 
Advocate.

Meeting  of the Central  Council  January  2,  1866 

Change  of  location. 

Cremer reported  that  the  room  in  18  Bouverie  St.  was  ready for the  reception  of the 
Council.  He  moved  that  we  meet  there  next  week.  The  Chairman  then  went  down 
to  Mr. Corbett  to  see  if  he  required  a  week's  notice.  On  his  return  he  stated  that 
Mr.Corbett  did  not require  any  notice.  Cremer's  motion was  ||[98]|  then  carried  and 
Fox  was  directed  to  call  on  Mr. Corbett  during  the  ensuing  week  and  bring  the  ac 
count  to  the  next  meeting  of the  Council. /

Correspondence. 

A  letter  from  our  correspondent  at  Condé-sur-Noireau  was  read  complaining  that 
through non-payment  of postage  his  cards  were  stopped  in the  English  Post  Office.

An  extract  was  read  from  the  Tribune du Peuple  stating  that the  "Society  of the Peo 
ple"  and  the  Brussels  section  of  the  International  Workingmen's  Association  had 
amalgamated,  so that the  Tribune  had,  in fact,  become  an organ of the Association. 

Vesinier's  attack  in  t he  E c ho  de  Verviers. 

Marx thought that the  Constitution published  in  the  Echo  de  Verviers  as  emanating  15 
from  the  French  branch  in  London  ought  to  have  been  laid  before  the  Council  be 
fore  publication.  He  then  alluded  to  the  attack which he  said  was  written by  Citizen 
Vésinier. 

Jung  denounced  the  attack  as  an  infamous  one  and  exposed  some  of its  misstate 

ments.  Such  a  manifesto  ought  to  have  been  signed. | 

20 

378 

Meeting  of the  Central  Council  January  9,  1866 

|[100] I  He  moved  that Vésinier retract  these  falsities  or  be  expelled  from  the  As 

sociation.  Le  Lubez  admitted  that Vésinier was  the  author  of the  attack. 

Marx  took  occasion  to  defend  our  Paris  Correspondents  from  the  aspersions 
made  upon  them.  They  had  left  with  the  Council  all  their  accounts  and  correspon-
dence  and  had  behaved  in  the  most  honourable  manner. 

5 

Dupont  thought  the  Council  could  not  overlook  the  matter  for  sake  of its  own 

dignity.  He  seconded  Jung's  motion. 

Bobczynski  said  the  Council  must  not  condemn  a  man  unheard.  Let  him  be  in 
vited  to  explain  his  attack  before  proceeding  to  extremities.  Marx  objected  to  the 
10  word  "retractation."  Vésinier  should  be  called  upon  to  substantiate  or  to  make  his 

exit. 

Le  Lubez  demands  that  the  articles  impeached  be  read  in  English. 
Fox  accordingly  read  both  articles  in  French  and  English.  Odger stated  that  they 
were  a  tirade  of abuse.  Weston  was  disposed  to  admit  that  Vésinier was justified  in 
15  blaming  the  remissness  of the  Central  Council  in  not having  discussed  a  single  so 
cial  question.  The  Council had  had  too  many  irons  in  the  fire.  That was  its  best  ex 
cuse.  Jung  then  withdrew his  motion  and  Marx  moved  and  Jung  seconded  that Vé 
sinier be  called upon to  substantiate  his  accusation  or,  failing  to  do  so,  be  expelled. 
Le Lubez  moved  as  an  amendment  that the  subject be  referred to  a Committee  of 
three  to  conduct  a  correspondence  with Vésinier.  He  objected  to  the  harsh measure 
of expulsion.  This  amendment  was  not  seconded. |

|[101]|  The  motion  of Marx  was  carried  with  one  dissentient  and  one  neutral. 

Polish  Insurrection  of  J an  22. 

25 

Bobczynski  stated  that  the  Poles  were  intending  to  celebrate  this  event.  He  invited 
the cooperation of the  Council.  The  Council having previously resolved  to celebrate 
this  event,  the  arrangements  were  referred  to  the  Standing  Committee. 

Secretaryship. 

30 

Cremer  stated  that  the  Appeal  for  Funds  which  the  Council  had  resolved  to  emit 
must  be  sent  out  by  somebody.  Anxious  to  forward  this  business,  he  would  resume 
the  Secretaryship  until  after  the  Congress.  As  his  resignation  had  never  been  ac 
cepted  and  as  no  one  had  manifested  any  disposition  to  accept  the  office,  he  pre 
sumed  no  further  formality  would  be  necessary. 

The  Council  then  adjourned. /

The  minutes  of the  former  Meeting  read  and  confirmed. 
Citizens  Longuet  and  Crespelle  were  nominated  members  of the  CC. 
Marx  communicated  that  Fox  had  received  a  letter  from  Mrs  O'Donovan  Rossa 
thanking  him  for  his  articles  on  Fenianism  in  the  Workman's  Advocate  and  the  re 
print in the  same paper of the  ladies'  appeal for the  support of the  convicted Fenians. 
Marx  proposed  the  appointing  of Longuet  in  his  place  as  the  Corresponding  Sec 
retary  of Belgium,  seconded  by  Jung.  Carried  Unanimously.  Jung  read  a  letter  of 
Möns  Dujoncquoy  ||[102]|  (Hotel  New  York)  requesting  the  payment  of 7£  17s  due 
to  him  since  the  September  conference. 

Jung  proposed  Lessner  seconded  That  Dupont  should  be  empowered  to  tell  Du 
joncquoy—that  on  Wednesday  next  he  should  receive  an  instalment  and  a  definite 
answer.  Carried  Unanimously. 

Jung  read  a  letter  from  Talbot  (Caen)  enclosing  one  pound  in  payment  for 
20  Cards—the  letter  stated  that  the  propaganda  is  proceeding  actively  in  different 
towns  of the  departments  of Calvados,  Ome  and  Manche. 

Wheeler  proposed  Jung  seconded  That  notice  be  given  to  every  member  of the 
Association  in  this  country  that  failing  to  pay  his  Contribution by  the  1 3th  February 
his  name  will  be  struck  out  of the  lists  of Members.  Carried  Unanimously. 

Werecki  explained  the  absence  of the  Poles  at  the  Standing  Committee  on  Mon 
day;  they  had  a  Meeting  and  got  the  necessary  money  together.  After  some  discus 
sion  the  public  meeting  in  commemoration  of the  last  Polish  insurrection  was  set 
tled  for  Monday  22  January  in  St  Martin's  Hall— 

Cremer  read  an  appeal  to  the  British  Members  of the  Association, 
On  the  motion  of Wheeler  seconded  by  Marx  it  was  unanimously  agreed 
1st  That  the  appeal  ought  to  appear  with  the  signatures  of such  British  members 
of the  CC  as  took  part  in  its  proceedings  and  were  sufficiently  known  to  Cremer  as 
men  not  likely  to  repudiate  their  names  being  used, 
2nd  That  subscription  sheets  ought  to  be  printed, 
3rd  That  the  money  sent was  to  be  directed  to  18  Bouverie  St.

The  bill  for  the  New  York  Hotel  expenses  was  brought  forward  and  discussed.

Dell  agreed  to  advance  two  pounds  towards  paying  an  instalment which,  with  1£ 

10s  held  by  Wheeler,  Cremer  was  ordered  to  pay. 

Marx  read  a  letter  from  the  Leipsic  Correspondent  Liebknecht,  they  had  formed 
a  small  branch  there,  he  also  referred  to  a  visit  he  had  recently  received  from  the 
Editor  of the  Social  Democrat, 

-  10 
« 

Marx  also  read  Letter  from  De  Paepe  explaining  his  long  silence,  he  was  sorry 
they  had  not  increased  in  numbers  but  they  had  now  confederated  with  the  People 
and had  made  the  Tribune  of the  People  their  Organ;  they  wished  to  exchange  with 
the  "Workman's  Advocate." 

Dupont  read  letter  from  Neufchâteau  from  correspondent  there  Lefebvre.  Jung 
15  also read  extract from  "Forerunner"  [and]  another Paper "The  Voice  of the  Future" 
published  in  the  French  language  in  Chaux  de  Fonds;  in  Basle  they  had  also 
formed  two  branches  of the  Association  and  were  expecting  a  number  of branches 
to  join  in  Germany,  they  had  read  in  a  French  Paper  that  in  Paris  they  had  made 
1,000  Adherents  in  last  month, 

20 

Cremer  called  attention  to  the  fact  that  Coraz  who  had  some  time  since  sailed 
for New  York  had  been  entrusted  with 400  Cards  of Membership  but no  returns  had 
been  received—Dupont  stated  he  expected  soon  to  hear  from  New  York. 

Dell  nominated  John  Hales  a  Member  of the  CC. 

Dell  thought  that  instead  of issuing  fresh  cards,  if the  Contribution  was  entered 
:  25  on the back of last year's  card  and  signed by  the  Financial  Secretary  that would be  | 

|[104]|  sufficient,  (Agreed  to). 

Weston  thought  the  CC  ought  to  begin  to  discuss  the  principles  contained  in  the 

programme  of the  Congress, 

Marx  agreed  but  thought  we  ought  first  decide  the  mode  in  which  they  ought  to 

'  30  be  discussed—he  proposed, 

"That  the  general  purposes  and  ruling  principles  of the  Association  as  laid  down 
in  the  address  and  statutes  be  first  defined  before  entering  upon  the  discussion  of

381 

The  Minute  Book  of the  Provisional  Central  Council  of the  I.W.M.A. 

the  questions  proposed  by  the  Conference."  Weston  seconded,  Eccarius  replied  to 
Weston  urging  the  necessity  for  Political  Agitation  now,  they  could  not  push  two 
ways  or  they  would  succeed  in  neither,  on  the  Continent  they  would  not  talk  or 
write  Politics  so  they  had  nothing  to  interest  them  but  Social  and  Religious  ques 
tions  but  here  political  agitation  was  a  primary  necessity. 

The  Resolution  was  Carried  Unanimously. 
The  Council  then  adjourned.

that  a  Meeting  of London  Trades  Delegates  were  about  to  assemble  to  consider  the 
question  of Boards  of Arbitration  for  the  settlement  of disputes  between  employers 
and  employed.  In  the  last  session  of parliament  Lord  St  Leonards  had  given  notice 
of a  bill  for  that  purpose,  and  it  was  ||[105]|  to  consider  the  provisions  of that  bill 
that  the  Meeting  were  about  to  assemble. 

In  France  there  had  been  for  years  in  active  operation  Boards  of Arbitration  and 
he thought if the Council were  to  appoint Delegates  to  attend that Meeting that val 
uable  information  would  be  given  to  that  Meeting  as  to  the  Working  of the  French 
councils.

Cit  Marx  being  absent  from  illness  Cit  Weston  as  the  seconder  of the  motion  for

not  making  much  progress  as  they—the  Members—had  been  threatened  by  their 
employers  with  being  discharged  if they  belonged  to  the  Association.  Duhamel  re 
plied  That  his  opinions  were  those  of the  Association  and  he  should  persevere,  he 
had  also  been  threatened  by  the  local  Attorney-General  and  the  Justice  of  the 
peace,  to  them  he  gave  the  same  answer  as  he  did  to  employers.  They  had  no  mon

The  Minutes  of the  former  meeting  were  read  and  confirmed, 
Cit  Fox  brought under notice  the  treatment  of the  Irish  state  prisoners  in  Penton-

which  appeared  in  the  Pall  Mall  Gazette  and  the  Lancet  had  also  denounced  the 
system  as  tending  to  insanity,  he  thought  that  a  Deputation ought  to  wait on  Sir  G. 
Grey  for  the  purpose  of procuring  a  better  mode  of treatment  for  these  unfortunate 
men,

Citizen  Shaw in the  Chair.  The  Minutes  of the previous  Meeting were  read  and  con 
firmed. 

Cit.  Dupont  proposed  Cit.  Lafargue  as  a  member  of the  Central  Council. 
Cit.  Longuet  read  a  letter  from  our  Paris  correspondents  in  reply  to  Vesinier's 

charge  of Buonapartism,  published  in  the  Espiègle  of Brussels. 

Cit.  Jung  brought  forward  a  letter  from  Gen.  Paz  in  reply  to  Marshal  Forey's  ob 
servations  in  the  French  Senate  which  had  been  published  in  the  Morning Advertiser 
and  desired  the  Council  to  send  it  to  the  Commonwealth  with  a request that  it be  re 
published.  Cit.  Fox  objected  and  thought  it  best  simply  to  submit  it  to  the  Editor's 
discretion  without recommendation  of any  kind.  This  suggestion  was  adopted  and  a 
letter  was  written  to  the  Editor  of the  Commonwealth  enclosing  a  copy  of Paz's  let 
ter.  A  long  conversation  on  the  affairs  of Mexico  then  ensued  and  the  Council  then 
adjourned.  /

President  Odger  in  the  chair. 

Cremer  announced  the  receipt  of  a  letter  from  Sir  George  Grey  refusing  to  re 
ceive  a  deputation  from  this  Association  anent  the  treatment  of the  Irish  State  pris 
oners.

Fox  stated  that he  had  drawn up  a  statement  of the  arguments  and  facts  which  he 
read  and  proposed  that  it  be  signed  by  the  President  and  sent  for publication  to  the 
Editor  of the  Commonwealth.  Lessner  seconded  the  same.  Carried  unanimously. 

Cit.  Dupont proposed,  Jung seconded the  election of Cit.  Lafargue,  one  of the  ex 

pelled  students  of Paris  ||[110]|  as  a member of the  Central Council.  He was  elected  10 
unanimously.  Fox  then  made  a  speech  in  French  informing  of his  election  and  of 
the  unwonted  pleasure  the  Council had  in  receiving  him  among  them.  Cit.  Lafargue 
replied  in  suitable  terms. 

Cit.  Louis  Wolff  then  brought  before  the  Council  the  article  written  by  Jung  in 
; 
the  name  of  the  Central  Council  and  published  in  the  Echo  de  Verviers.  He  com-  15 
plained  of  the  introduction  of his  name  into  the  controversy  as  Vésinier  had  not 
mentioned  it,  and  of the  statement  that  he  and  his  Italian  friends  did  not  enjoy  the 
\ 
confidence  of the  workingmen  of Italy.  It  was  false  to  say  he  had  ever  been  at  Na- 
pies.  He  further  alleged  that  there  were  four  falsehoods  concerning  Mazzini,  viz, 
i 
that  the  règlements  were  not  drawn  up  by  him,  that  he  did  not  know  of Marx's  ad-  2Q¡ 
dress  and,  lastly,  that  had  he  known  of  it  he  would  have  opposed  its  adoption. 
Fourthly  that  Mazzini  did  not  oppose  the  translation  of the  Address  but  only  ob- 
jected  to  certain  passages  therein  amounting  in  all  to  about  9  or  10  words. 

; 
; 

Cit.  Jung  defended  his  letter  and  said  that  the  Italian  Socialists  had  no  confi 

dence  in  Wolff &  Co. 

Wolff rejoined  that the  word  "Socialist"  was  nowhere used  and  that there  were no 
Socialists  in  Italy  in  the  French  sense  of the  word.  After  a  discussion  in  which  Cits. 
Cremer,  Odger,  Weston,  Howell,  Le  Lubez,  Fox,  and  Eccarius  took part,  the  follow 
ing  resolution  was  passed  (with  two  dissentients): 

ι 
"The  offensive  expressions with  regard to  an  eminent writer of Latin  race written  "¡ 

in  the  name  of the  Central  Council in  reply to  Vésinier's  attack  on  the  ||[111]|  Asso 
ciation  and  published  in  the  'Echo  de  Verviers,'  having  arisen  through  a  misunder-

Meeting  of the Central  Council  March  6,  1866 

standing,  the  Central  Council willingly withdraws  such expressions  and  also  any  ex 
pressions  of similar  character  in  relation  to  Cit.  Wolff and  his  friends." 

On  the  motion  of Cit.  Fox  it  was  ordered  that  not  less  than  3,000  copies  of the 

Address  for  funds  be  printed. 

The  Council  then  adjourned  to  the  1 3t h./

The  reading  of the  minutes  of the  previous  meeting  was  postponed  by  common 

consent.

5 

Cit  Fox  gave  a  report  of  the  International  Association's  deputation  to  the  Reform 
Conference  so  far  as  he  and  Cit  Shaw  were  concerned. 

Eccarius  confirmed  the  accuracy  of the  same. 

Switzerland 

Cit  Jung  made  a  report  of the  doings  in  that  Country.

Cit  Dupont  asked  for  Credentials  for  some  of his  correspondents  in  France.

Cit  Marx,  Wolff  a nd  M a z z i ni 

Cit  Marx  made  a  speech  in  reference  to  the  proceedings  at  the  previous  meetings, 
He  said  it  was  not true  as  Major Wolff had  stated  that  Mazzini had  written  our  Sta-  15> 
; 
tutes.  He  (Marx)  wrote  them  after  discussion  in  Committee—several  draughts  were 
í 
discussed  Wolffs  draught  among  the  rest.  On  two  points  they  were  quite  distin- 
' 
guished  from  each  other.  Marx  spoke  of  ||[112]|  Capital  oppressing  Labour.  Wolff 
wanted  centralisation  and  understood  by  Working  Men's  Associations  only  Benefit 
-
Societies.  Mazzini's  statutes  were  printed  at  the  time  of the  Conference  in  Naples.  2(1 

392 

Meeting  of the  Central  Council  March  13,  1866 

It could hardly be  true  that Mazzini had  seen Marx'  address  before  it was  printed  as 
it  was  in  Marx'  pocket,  unless  Mazzini  saw  it  after  it  had  been  put  in  Le  Lubez' 
hands  and  before  it  had  been  taken  to  the  Bee-Hive—Again  Mazzini  wrote  to  Brus 
sels  to  Fontaine  a  letter which  was  to  be  communicated  to  the  Belgian  Societies,  in 
which he  warned them against Marx'  Socialist views,  this  was  stated  by  De  Paepe  at 
the  Conference. 

Major Wolff was  not  a  member  of the  Council.  Major  Wolff ought  to  have  sent  a 
letter  informing  the  Council  that  he  intended  to  prefer  his  complaint.  He  [Marx] 
protested  against  the  proceedings  at  the  last  meeting  in  the  name  of himself and  the 
other  Continental  Secretaries—he  desired  a  note  of this  to  be  taken  as  it  might  be 
brought before  the  Congress  at Geneva.  Le  Lubez  said  there  were  two  documents  of 
which  [one]  was  not  exclusively  Marx's.  Something was  taken from  Mazzini's man 
uscript.  He  explained  how  Vesinier's  mistake  arose,  he  insisted  that  Major  Wolff 
was  a  delegate  of the  Italian  Society  at  our  Board.

10 

15 

Dupont  protested  against  the  attitude  of the  Central  Council  and  against  its  reso 
lution,  he  admitted  the  error  of fact  in  Jung's  letter  about  Major Wolff being  at  Na 
ples. 

20 

Citizen  Orsini  asserted  that  there  were  socialists  in  Italy  and  that  Mazzini  held  a 
reactionary  attitude  towards  Science.  Charles  Cattaneo  and  Ferrari  were  Socialists. 
Fox made  a  speech  in  which he  stated  that he  was  not  a  worshipper  of Mazzini  as  a 
European  leader,  neither  did  he  think  that  the  majority  of the  British  members  had 
any  decided  leanings  in  that  direction.

.; 

Citizen  Shaw  was  elected  pro  tem  the  Secretary. 
The  President  having  stated  that  the  minutes  of  the  last  meeting  could  not  be 

read  in  consequence  of Citizen  Fox  being  engaged  at  the  "Reform  League." 

Citizen Jung  said,  he was  sorry  the  minutes  of the  last meeting  could  not be read, 
because  Citizen  Orsini who was  about to  start for America was  anxious  that what he 
had  said  regarding  Mazzini  should  not  be  misconstrued  as  he  had  the  greatest  re 
spect for Mazzini. 

10 

Citizen Jung  then  said,  that  Citizen  Orsini would  leave  Letters  of introduction  to 
the  leading  Socialists  of Spain,  Portugal  and  Italy;  also  that he  had  recommended  a 
friend  who,  when  he  became  a  member  of the  Council  would  act  as  Secretary  for 
Italy. 

Citizen  Dell,  the  Financial  Secretary,  presented  Citizen  Orsini with  24  Books  of  15 

the  Laws  of the  Association  for  him  to  distribute  on  his  travels. 

Citizen  Jung  read  extracts from  Swiss  Correspondence  and  expressed  a strong  de 

sire  that  the  Standing  Committee  should  resume  its  weekly  sittings. 

Citizen  Buckley  was  then  appointed  to  wait  upon  Citizen  Cremer  to  obtain  the 
proof copy  of the  Council's  appeal  to  the  Societies  and  to  forward  the  same  to  the  20

lows,  That  during  the  month  of February  67  new Members  had joined  the  Geneva 
section  of  the  Association,  That  New  Branches  had  been  formed  in  the  following

in Wüste-Giersdorf (Prussian  Silesia),  1  in  Aubonne  (Swiss  Land),  2  in  Peterswal-
dau,  2  in Langenbielau,  1  in  Emsdorf,  the  last  5  being  situated  in the Weaving  dis 
tricts  of  Silesia. 

The  Tailors'  Strike  was  then  introduced  by  Citizen  Hansen,  who  said  that 
Mr  Poole  of Savile  Row  intended  to  get  men  from  the  Continent  to  supplant  those 
on  Strike.  It was  then  proposed  by  Citizen  Shaw  and  seconded  by  Citizen  Lucraft, 
That  the  Continental  Secretaries  be  instmcted  to  inform  ||[115]|  their  respective 
Correspondents,  with  a view  to  keep  Continental Workmen  away  from London  dur

The  President then  said,  that  before  acting  on  the  Resolution  of the  Council with 
respect  to  the  Tailors'  Strike  he  had  waited  on  the  Tailors'  Executive  Committee 
who  informed  him  that  they  had  written  to  Germany.  Consequently  he  considered 
that  there  was  no  necessity  for  him  to  proceed  any  further  in  the  matter. 

Citizen  Jung  said,  that  since  the  last  meeting  ||[116]|  he  had  had  an  interview 
with  the  Tailors'  Executive  Committee  and  the  result  was  an  expression  of  kind 
feeling  towards  the  Association  and  a  promise  to join  it.

time  past  been  discussing  the  propriety  of building  Workingmen's  houses  in  Lau-
sanne  on  the  plan  of  those  erected  in  Guise  in  France;  they  had  agreed  upon  a 
scheme  for  raising  the  money  and  wished  to  have  their  plan  discussed  at  the  Con 
gress.

Dupleix,  both  reminding  the  Central  Council that  the  date  fixed  for the  assembling 
25  of Congress  was  drawing  nigh  and  complaining  that,  for  months  past  the  Central 
Council  had  given  no  signs  of Life;  they  observed  that,  if the  inactivity  continued 
much  longer  it would  be  fatal  to  the  Association;  they  asked  a  number  of questions 
and required  answers  immediately,  1st  the  precise  date  of the  opening  of Congress, 
2nd  how  the  expenses  of the  Delegates  ||[117]|  were  to  be  defrayed,  and  other  ques-

At  the  sitting  of the  Central  Council  on  Tuesday  evening,  Mr. Barry,  deputed  from 
the  Tailors'  Protective  Association,  attended  to  thank  the  Central  Council  for  the 
invaluable  aid  which  they  had  rendered  to  the  tailors  in  their  late  strike.  It  was  be 
yond  a  doubt  through  the  influence  and  agency  of  the  International  Association 
that  the  master  tailors  had  failed  to  procure  men  on  the  continent;  he  had  also  the 
pleasure  of announcing  that  the  tailors  had  decided  to join  the  International  Asso 
ciation.  (Cheers.) 

A resolution  was  subsequently carried  to  admit  the  Tailors'  Association  as  an  af 

filiated  branch.

The  correspondent  in  Belgium,  Cit.  De  Paepe,  forwarded  a  copy  of the  organ  of 
the  association  in  Belgium,  which  contained  interesting  reports  of  the  agitation 
now  going  on  in  Belgium  for  universal  suffrage.

Cit  Dell  in  the  Chair. 

The  minutes  of the  previous  meeting  were  read  and  confirmed. 
The  Chairman  asked  Cit  Shaw  if he  was  willing  to  resign  the  office  of  Secretary 
5  Pro  tern which he had  filled  for some  weeks.  Cit  Shaw  said he  was.  Cit  Cremer said 
he  was  quite  willing  to  stand  aside  to  make  way  for  Cit  Shaw;  several  members 
spoke  on the  question  and  ultimately  it  was  agreed  on  the  proposition  of Cit  Shaw 
seconded  by  Cit  Eccarius  That  Cit  Cremer  resume  his  duties  as  Secretary.

Mr  B. Patis,  Delegate  from  the  wire  workers,  attended  to  thank  the  Council  for 
the  efforts  which  they  had  put  forth  to  prevent  their  employers  getting  workmen 
from  the  Continent  to  supply  the  places  of  the  men  on  Strike;  he  also  stated  the 
Wire  Workers  would join  the  Association. 

Jung  read  letter  from  Dujoncquoy  asking  for  the  ||[122]|  balance  of his  account— 
ordered  to  be  paid.  Cit  Jung  read  Letters  from  Dupleix  and  Becker  urging  the  ne-
15  cessity  for  the  postponement  of the  Congress  to  the  last  week  in  September;  they 
also  announced  that  the  Central  Committee  of the  Italian  Societies  had  given  in 
their  adhesion  to  the  principles  of  the  Association  and  stated  they  would  have  a 
central  gathering  in  June  when  the  necessity  for joining  the  Association  and  send 
ing  Delegates  to  the  Congress  would  be  discussed  and  decided— 

.20 

Cit  Traini  suggested  that  Cit  Jung  should  enquire  of  Cit  Becker  and  Dupleix 
what  the  Italian  Societies  were  who  had  so  expressed  themselves  and  where  they 
were  located— 

Jung  proposed Wheeler  seconded  that  Cit  Dupont  write  to  Paris  urging  on  the  Pa 
ris Administration  the  necessity  of postponing  the  Congress.  Carried  Unanimously.

|[123]|  Meeting  of Central  Council  May  1st  1866 

Cit  Carter  in  the  Chair. 

The  minutes  of the  previous  meeting  were  read  and  confirmed. 
Cits  Jung  and  Dupont  proposed  that  Cit  Giacomo  Traini  be  elected  Secretary  for 

5 

Italy. 

In  proposing  Cit  Traini  Cit  Jung  eulogised  Cit  Traini's  devotion  to  the  principle 

of liberty  and  the  cause  of progress  generally. 

Cit  Longuet,  the  Secretary  for  Belgium  read  from  the  Brussels  Tribune  du  Peuple 
an  exhortation  to  the  wire-workers  of Belgium  not  to  engage  with  the  London  mas-
ter wire-workers  at  the  present  time.

Citizen  Fox  laid  upon  the  table  copies  of the  St. Louis  Miner and Artisan  contain 

ing  extracts  from  the  London  and  Continental  organs  of the  Association. 

15 

Cit  Dupont  read  a  letter  from  De  Marckel  of Granville,  Manche,  asking  for  the 
names  of those  who  desired  copies  of the  "Congrès  Ouvrier."  He  had  been  visiting 
the  Workmen  in  their  dinner  hour  making  propagandism  for  the  Association,  he 
had  assured  them  that  the  Association  was  not  political  but  that  all  was  fair  and 
above  board,  he  expected  to  be  successful  in  his  locality. 

Cit  Lafargue  read  a  letter  from Prudhomme  of Bordeaux  asking where  he  should 
send  the  money  received  for  Members'  Cards;  Lafargue  was  instructed  to  advise 

20  him  to  send  it  to  the  Central  Council. 

Dupont  read  a  letter  from  Fribourg  (Paris)  stating  the  Paris  Administration  were 

opposed  to  the  further  postponement  of  the  Congress  for  the  following  reasons 

1st  That  the  September  Conference  had  given  a  solemn  pledge  to  Europe  to  con 

voke  the  Congress  in  May.-

25 

2nd That  very many  were  waiting for the  assembling of the  Congress which would 

decide  them  as  to  giving  in  their  adhesion  to  the  Association. 

3rd  That  three  months  delay  will  not  make  the  Association  and  might  destroy

|[124]|  In  Paris  they  had  begun  to  prepare  for  the  election  of their  Delegates,  as 
30  yet  they  could  not  say  how  many  would  be  elected  but  they  might  at  all  events 
count  on  a  score,  the  Delegates  would  carry with them  a  complete plan  of organiza 
tion  for  the  Association  as  well  as  the  results  of their  deliberations  on  the  proposed 

405 

The  Minute  Book  of the  Provisional  Central  Council  of the  I.W.M.A. 

questions.  They  were  glad  to  hear  of  the  progress  the  Association  was  making  in 
England  and  finally  they  did  not  believe  that  the  convocation  of the  Congress  on 
the  4th  of June  would  interfere  with  the  prestige  of the  Association— 

The  letter concluded by referring to  the  correspondence from the  Provinces  as  be 
ing  indicative  of a  desire  for  the  assembling  of the  Congress  on  June  4th  but  if the 
Central  Council  determined  to  postpone  the  Congress  for  three  months  they  in  Pa 
ris  must  make  the  best  of the  decision.— 

Cit  Lafargue  said  he  thought  Fribourg  exaggerated  somewhat  the  injuries  that 
would  arise  from  the  postponement  of the  Congress,  the  decision  of the  CC  might 
cause  a panic  in  Paris  but  such would not  be the  case  in many  other parts  of France 
where  the  Association  had  only just  begun. 

Dupont  thought  the  Lyonnese  would  be  favorable  to  the  further postponement  of 

the  Congress,  he  judged  so  from  past  correspondence— 

Jung  thought  it  essential  to  decide  when  the  Congress  should  be  held—supposing 
that  it  was  decided  to  further  postpone  it  he  feared  we  must  override  the  views  of 
our  Parisian  Friends—he  would  prefer August  to  September  as  in  the  latter  month 
men  generally  would  be  too  much  engaged  to  attend— 

Some  of the  Council  having  expressed  a  desire  to  (if possible)  convoke  the  Con 
gress  on  the Anniversary  of the Association viz  the  2 8th  September,  Cit Jung replied 
and  expressed  fears  that  such  date  ||[125]|  would  be  almost  fatal  but  he  would  pro 
pose  the  first  Monday  in  September  as  the  Day  for  the  assembling  of  the  Con 
gress—Cit  Maurice  seconded  the  proposition  which  was  Carried  Unanimously. 

T he  a n n o u n c e m e nt  to  the  C o n t i n e nt 

Marx  proposed  Fox  seconded  That  the  Secretaries  of  the  respective  nationalities 
announce  as  quickly  as  possible  to  their  Correspondents  the  above  decision.  Car 
ried  Unanimously.

Cit  Frank  Robert  and  Ralph  Dutton  were  nominated  by  Cremer  and  Lessner. 

R e p o rt  of  Standing  C o m m i t t ee 

The  Secretary  then  brought  up  the  report  of  the  Standing  Committee  adjourned 
from  the  last  sitting  of the  Council  but  as  the  Council  had  decided  to  postpone  the 
Congress  the  immediate  adoption  of the  propositions  from  the  Standing  Committee 
had  been  obviated  and  their  further  consideration  was  again  adjourned  with  the  ex 
ception  of the  two  following  which were  Carried  Unanimously  on  the  proposition  of 
Cremer  and  Le  Lubez, 

"That  each  member of the  CC  hold  himself in  readiness  to  visit  organised  bodies 

406 

Meeting  of the Central  Council  May  1,  1866 

to  induce  them  to join  the  Association  and  to  contribute  towards  the  expenses  of 
the  Congress." 

"That  all  Societies  sending  Delegates  to  the  Congress  must  pay  the  expenses  of 

the  Delegates." 

R e p o rt  of  D e p u t a t i o ns 

Jung gave  report of his  and  Cit Lafargue's visit to No  2  Lodge  of Operative  Bricklay 
ers—they  had  been  most  enthusiastically  received  and  had  received  promises  of 
support.  The members had  also  expressed  surprise  that  they  had not  been  waited  on 
before. 

Cremer  reported  that  he  had  waited  on  the  City  of London  Ladies'  Shoemakers 
who  were  ||[126]|  compelled  to  adjourn  from  pressure  of business  consequently  he 
did  not  get  a  hearing  but  they  had  invited  him  to  their  next  meeting  and  promised 
him  a  hearing. 

Cremer  also  reported  that  he  had  made  arrangements  with  the  Secretary  of  the 

Day  Working  Bookbinders  for  a  deputation  to  wait  on  their  next  meeting. 

Citizen  Dupont  stated  that  the  French  branch  in  London  of the  International As 

sociation  had  resolved  to  form  a  co-operative  association. 

T he  Tailors  a nd  their  late  Strike 

Lessner  reported  that  as  a  number  of German  Tailors  had  been  imported  into  Edin 
burgh  and  as  it  was  currently  reported  that  some  of  the  London  employers  were 
making  arrangements  to  bring  several  here—The  German  Tailors  resident  in  Lon 
don  had  formed  themselves  into  a  Committee  and  wished  to  cooperate  with  the 
Council  of  the  I. W. M. A.  to  checkmate  the  designs  of  the  Employers  and  their 
Agents  which  they  had  in  Germany. 

Marx  stated  that  if Lessner  would  send  him  the  facts  that  he  would  directly  com 

municate  with  the  German  Papers. 
The  Council  then  adjourned.

The  Secretary  for  France  read  an  encouraging  correspondence  from  Bordeaux,  in 
which  it  was  stated,  that  the  Association,  when  once  it  became  known,  would  carry

The  date  of  the  assembling  of  this  congress  was  postponed  by  a  unanimous  vote 
from  June  4,  to  Monday  Sept. 3.  The  reason  assigned  being  the  unpreparedness  of 
the  Genevese  to  receive  the  members  of  the  Congress  at  present,  particularly  in 
view  of the  large  delegation  which  is  announced  as  likely  to  attend  from  Paris,  the 
necessity  of  having  further  time  for  preparing  papers  on  the  programme  question, 
and  the  desirability  of  having  Italy  represented  thereat.

Poland  had  not  attended  the  Council  for  months,  he  wished  to  know  if  his  name

Correspondence 

Dupont  read  a  Letter  from  Lyons.  On  the  3 0th  of April  they  had  held  a  meeting  at 
which  210  members  attended,  when  five  members  were  elected  to  attend  the  Con 
gress—A  Committee  of  5  was  also  elected  to  consider  and  report  on  the  various  15 
questions  in the programme.  They  wished  to  know whether they were  to retain  the  | 
|[128]|  money  they  received  for  Members'  Cards  till  the  Congress  or  if they  were  to 
send  it  to  the  CC—they  hoped  soon  to  have  from  2  to  300  members  in Lyons.  They 
had  lately  received  a  request  from  Villefranche  for  permission  to  open  a new  branch 
there. 

20 

Cits  Fox  and  Hales proposed  "That the  Lyonnese  be  requested  to  send  to  the  CC 

one-fourth  of the  contribution  they  receive  for  Members'  Cards." 

Cits  Marx  and  Jung  proposed

For  resolution  5—For  Amendment  4. 
Cit  Jung  in  the  absence  of the  Secretary  for  Italy  read  a  letter  from  Citizen  Ca-
nessa,  of Genoa,  the  editor  of a  working  men's  paper  in  that  seaport.  It  gave  an  ac 
count  of the  federation  of working  men's  associations  in  Genoa,  and  expressed  a 
desire for further  information  concerning  the  principles  and  procedure  of the  Inter 
national  Working  Men's  Association. 

Cit  Jung  laid  copies  of the  last  number  of the  Vorbote  on  the  table,  and  read  ex 
tracts  from  its  monthly  bulletin.  From  this  it  appeared  that fifty-three members  had 
joined  the  Association  in  Geneva  in April  last,  and  notice  of adhesion had  been  re-
ceived  from  the  following  recently-founded  sections,  namely  Biel  (Canton  Berne); 
Lausanne  (Canton Vaud);  in  Grafrath  (Rhenish Prussia);  in  St.Imier,  a mixed  body 
of  German  and  Latin  race,  in  Pruntrut  (Canton  Berne).  The  mixed  (Teutono-
Latin)  section  of Chaux  de  Fonds  had  increased,  sixty  in  April  last,  and  the  pure 
Latin  section  [in  Lausanne]  by  forty-five  members. 

15 

The  same  Secretary  announced  that  the  central  committee  of  Geneva  had  re 
ceived  the  following  letter  from  Gaspare  Stampa,  of Milan,  in  the  name  of the  cen 
tral  committee  of Italian  working  men's  associations:— 

20 

25 

Respected  Committee,—The  fraternal  bond  of  the  Italian  working  men's  associa-
tions  was  formed  in  Naples  in  October,  1864,  and  at  the  same  time  a  committee 
was  appointed  to  bring  this  union  to  the  general  cognisance,  and  to  set  it  into  op 
eration  according  to  the  resolution  sent  herewith. 

Our aims  are your  aims,  and  the  more  extensive  our relations,  the  more  powerful 

"Milan,  April,  1866. 

is  our  life. 

The  central  committee,  whose  organ  I  am,  would  not  be  doing  its  duty  if it  did 
not  claim your  co-operation.  The  death  of Professor  Savi  in  Genoa,  who  was  one  of 
the  most  indefatigable  propagandists  of  the  working  class  question,  as  well  as  the 
distance  from  each  other  of  the  members  of the  committee,  who  live  in  different 
places,  have  been  in  this,  the  first  year  of  our  existence,  the  cause  of  much  hin-

30  drance  to  our work. 

We  hereby  give  our full  and  entire  adhesion  to  your programme,  and  we  beg  you 
at  the  same  time  to  gladden  us  with  your fraternal  intercourse,  and  to  send  us  your 
organ  the  Vorbote,  in  order  that  our  Moniteur  may  make  use  of  its  important  and 
praiseworthy  contents.

in  the  name  of the  Central  Committee, 

Fraternally  yours,

The  Gen  Sec  read  correspondence  from  the  Darlington  Shoemakers  expressing 
their  deep  interest  in  the  Association  and  promising  future  support.  Also  from  the 
W  Darlington  Tailors  sending  in  their  adhesion  and  5s.  ||[129]|  Cit  Fox  gave  notice 
that  at  the  next  meeting  of the  Council  he  should  call  attention  to  a  passage  in  the 
last  Letter  of Cit  Engels  which  passage  involved  the  question  of Nationalities.

The  Minute  Book of the  Provisional  Central  Council  of the  I. W. M. A. 

Excursion  to  Ireland. 

Citizen  Weston  brought  before  the  Central  Committee  the  project  of Mr. Lilley  to 
form  an  excursion  party  of  300  persons  to  Ireland  in  July  or  August  next.  As  this 
body  had  at  heart  the  amelioration  of the  relations  between  the  English  and  Irish

15  men  have  applied  to  the  Geneva  section  of the  International  Association,  asking 
them  to  inform  the  men  in  other  countries.  The  Geneva  Committee  have  informed

1.  "The Central Council of the International Association of Working Men recom-  10 

mend  to  their  fellow  working  men  in  arms  not  to  waste  their  strength  in  slaying 
each  other,  but  to  economise  it  for  the  defence  of their  rights  against  their  only  en 
emies,  the  enslavers  of the  working  class.  Their  opinion  is  that  no  man  need  obey 
any  power he  has  had  no  voice  in  electing,  or  any  law  he  has  had  no  voice  in  mak 
ing.  Therefore,  (2.)  every  soldier,  who  has  not made  the  cause  he  is  fighting  for,  his  15> 
own  by  being  convinced  that  it  is just,  is  relieved  from  his  obligation  to  fight  for  it. 
(3.)  If that right  should  be  denied  him  and  that  force  be  used  to  coerce  him,  he  has 
a right,  and  it is his duty  to  defend  that right,  which is  the right of the  people,  by us 
ing  force  himself." 

Before the debate began, the Courrier Français of the 17th inst. was brought before 20 j 

the  council  and  the  rejoinder of the  students  was  read  and  given  to  the  Editor  of the 
Commonwealth  to  translate  and  publish  the  same.  For  the  previous  correspondence

of humanity,  and  you  have  responded  to  our  appeal.  Thanks,  a  thousand  thanks! 
United for the noblest of causes,  we  shall continue  to  claim in  common  the  rights 
for which  humanity  has  ever  combated;  labour  and  universal  peace  will guide  us  in

"The  masters  of the  world"  will  in  vain  endeavour  to  revive  the  obsolete  quarrels 
of the  past,  the  traditional  rivalries  of nations.  Universal Reason  will  respond  to  the 
appeals  of the  fife  and  drum  by  a  prodigious  cry  of peace,  by  a  warm  grasp  of all

day  in  which  all  men,  united  by  science,  will  march  with  one  accord  to  the  final 
conquest  of  liberty. 

Our  forefathers,  led  astray  and  enslaved,  had  for  their  war-cry  "God  and  our 

IO  country!" 

Let  us,  the  great  grandsons  of 1793,  have  for  supreme  aim  to  inscribe  on  the  one 
only flag of the people  these  two  words,  which  are  the  symbols  of our convictions  and 
our  hopes,  "Reason  and  Fraternity!" 

It  is  for  you,  working  men,  to  realise  in  the  future  these  vast  projects—it  is  for 
15  you  to  cement  the  union  of mankind  by  your  labour,  the  firmness  of your  princi 

ples,  and  your  inflexible  devotion  to  the  salvation  of the  human  race. 
Be  assured  that  your  brothers  will  not  abandon  you  in  the  struggle.

Mazzini  and  Garibaldi  were  both  good  Socialists—In  consequence  of  such  attack 
he  must  tender  his  resignation  as  Italian  Secretary, 

Cit  Lafargue  replied  that  what  he  had  written  he  had  written  in  his  individuall 
|[141]|  capacity  not  as  a  Member  of the  CC  who  were  in  no  way  responsible  for  his 

5  opinions. 

Cit  Fontaine  said  he  had  expressed  the  same  opinions  only  in  a  stronger manner; 
after  some  discussion  Cremer  [proposed]  Dutton  seconded  That  we  pass  to  the  or 
der of the  day  and  that  Cit Traini  be  written  to  and  told  that  the  Council  are  not re 
sponsible  for  Cit  Lafargue's  views.  Carried  Unanimously. 

10 

T he  adjourned  debate 

The  debate  was  resumed  by  Cit  Bobczynski  who  said  that  though  Mazzini,  Gari 
baldi  and  Bismark  were  acting  together  they  were  acting  from  different  motives.  If 
the  Association  was  only  to  be  Social  it  would  never  be  great,  its  first  duty  was  to 
get  rid  of tyrants  on  the  Continent. 

15 

Cit Jung  thought that  although  Garibaldi's  heart was undoubtedly right his head 
and  sword  were  in  the  wrong  place;  he was  sorry to  see  him  and  Mazzini  in  alliance 
with  Bismark,  he  thought  the  upshot  of the  war would  be  revolution. 

The  debate  was  continued  by  Cits  Bobczynski,  Lafargue,  Cremer,  Fontaine. 
Cit  Dutton  said  that  Workmen  of all  countries  could  work  out  their  Political  and 

20  Social  independence  without  fighting  for  nationalities. 

Cits  Bobczynski  and  Carter  then  gave  notice  of the  following  resolution 
"That  the  London  members  of the  International Working  Men's  Association  con 
sider  the  present  conflict  on  the  Continent  to  be  one  between  tyrants,  and  advise 
working  men  to  be  neutral,  but  to  associate  themselves  with  a  view  to  acquire 
strength by  unity  and  to  use  the  strength  so  acquired  in  striking  a  final  blow  at  all 
the  tyrants  of Europe  and  proclaiming  their  own  liberty." 

25 

Cits  Cremer  and  Dutton  also  gave  notice  of the  following  series  of resolutions 
1. That  the  war  now  being  waged  in  Europe  between  the  Prussian  and  Austrian 
governments  is  a  war  for  Empire,  and  as  such  is  not  calculated  to  benefit  the  peo-
30  pies,  as  whichever  becomes  the  victor  it  will  be  but  the  substitution  of one  despot 

for  another. 

2. The  Council  regrets  that  the  Prussian  people  should  have  allowed  their  ener 
gies  to  be  diverted  from  the  extension  and  consolidation  of their liberties  by  the  war 
policy  of Bismarck  who  has  thereby  succeeded  in  rivetting  still  stronger  their  politi-

35  cal fetters. | 

|[142]|  3.  The  Council also  expresses  a hope that the Italian people, while  endeav 
ouring  to  give  liberty  to  the  Venetians,  will  not  enter  into  an  unholy  alliance  with 
the  Prussian  government,  and  so  be  guilty  of moral  and  political  suicide  by  at  the 
same  time  fighting  to  rescue  the  Venetians  and  assisting  the  Prussian  government 

40  to enslave  the  German people. 

4.  That  as  all wars  not  waged  on  behalf of liberty  and justice  are  cruel  and unjus 
tifiable,  we  therefore  recommend  the  peoples  of Europe  to  abstain  from  taking  any 
active  part  in  the  present  unrighteous  struggle.

Cit.  Fox  gave  notice  of the  following  resolution:— 
"That the  Prussian government  is  responsible  for the miseries  caused  by the pres 

ent  war  on  the  Continent." 

The  Council  then  adjourned  to  July  3r d. |

ciety  of Coopers,  the  members  of which  had  convened  a  special  meeting  to  receive 
them.  After  listening  for  some  time  with  a  deep  interest  to  the  deputation  many  of 
the  members  spoke  warmly  in  support  of the  principles  of  the  Association,  and  as 
an  earnest  of their  deep  convictions  they  agreed  to join  in  a  body  and  levied  each 
member  one  shilling  towards  defraying  the  expenses  of the  Geneva  Congress.  The 
General  Secretary  also  reported  that  the  West-end  Cabinet  Makers  had  sent  in  their

433 

The  Minute  Book of the  Provisional  Central  Council  of the I. W. M. A. 

F r a n c e. 

Cit.  Dupont,  French  Secretary,  read  a  letter  from  Neuville-sur-Saône  near  Lyons, 
asking  permission  to  open  a  branch  there.  The  Secretary  thanked  the  Council  for 
the  high  mission  they  had  undertaken.  The  request  was  agreed  to,  and  Cit.  Louis 
Baudrand,  E.Beniere  and  T.M.  Colomb were  appointed  correspondents  of the Asso 
ciation  for  that  locality.  A letter was  also  read  from  Lyons  asking  for information  in 
regard  to malleable  castings.  The  Secretary was  instructed to  make  some  enquiries. 

T he  T r e a t m e nt  of  the  Irish  State  Prisoners 
at  Portland. 

Cit.  Fox  stated  that  before  the  expiration  of the  six  months'  term  the  Irish  state  10 
prisoners  lately  confined  in  Pentonville  prison  were  removed  to  Portland jail,  where 
alone  their  friends  were  allowed  to  visit  them.  He  then  read  the  following  extract 
from  a letter  received  from the wife  of one  of the  said  prisoners.  This  lady  states  the 
conditions  under  which  these  prisoners  may  be  seen  by  their  female  relatives  and 
the  crushing  treatment  to  which  they  are  subjected—treatment  to  which  one  of  15 
their  number  has  already  fallen  a  victim. 

"Mrs.  Luby  and  O'Leary's  sisters  have  been  to  Portland.  They  were  much  disap 
pointed  in  having  to  see  the  prisoners  through  wire  screens.  It  seems  to  me  that  the 
English  Government  must  have  an  exalted  opinion  of the  ingenuity  and  cleverness 
of Irish  women,  when  even  with  all  the  safekeeping  that  bars  and  bolts  and jailors  20 
can  insure,  it  will  not  trust  a  prisoner's  wife  to  touch  that  prisoner's  hand  or  even 
see  his  face  unscreened;  or  is  such  precaution  used  as  a  refinement  of  cruelty, 
which  it  certainly  is  whether  intended  to  be  or  not.  Here  are  a  few  facts  as  to  their 
treatment given  by Luby and  O'Leary.  At labour from five a.m.  to  eight p.m.  Break 
fast  of cocoa  and  heavy  unpalatable  bread,  supper  of thin  gruel  half enough  at  each 
meal.  Dinner,  two  days five ounces  meat, five potatoes  and  bread;  two next  days,  a 
pint  of  something  called  soup,  and  bread;  two  days  again,  they  dine  on  suet  pud 
ding  and  on  Sunday  they  have  bread  and  cheese.  They  have  no  chaplain.  Their la 
bour  is  quarrying, washing the  convicts'  clothes,  and  scrubbing;  by  turns.  It  is  easy 
to  understand  that  many  of  these  men  will  sink  under  such  treatment  combined  30 
with  all  the  petty  tyranny  practised  on  them  by  the  more  brutal  of their jailors,  and 
without  the  consolation  of  either  letters  or  visits  from  their  friends.  Luby  and 
O'Leary wished  this  put  before  the  public.  I  have  not  seen  my husband,  I  will go  to 
see  him  in  a  few  weeks,  and  I  know  he  too  will  wish  this  course  the  government 
takes  with  state  prisoners  to  be  published.

Mrs.  J. O'Donovan Rossa." 
The  Central  Council  by  a  unanimous  vote  ordered  that  the  extract  should  be  as 
widely  published  as  possible.

T he  E u r o p e an  W ar 

Cit  Fox translated from the  "Courrier Français"  a letter  signed by  Fribourg  in  rela 
tion  to  the  war  and  the  Social  question. | 

|[147]|  T he  Discussion  on  the  W ar 

was  then  resumed.  Cits.  Dutton,  Bobczynski  and  Marx were  the  principal  speakers. 
Cits.  Cremer  and  Fox  withdrew  their  respective  amendments,  and  the  wording  of 
the  Bobczynski—Carter resolution  was  amended  and  ultimately passed,  nem con,  in 
the  following  form. 

"That  the  Central  Council  of the  International  Working  Men's  Association  con 
sider  the  present  conflict  on  the  Continent  to  be  one  between  Governments  and  ad 
vise  working  men  to  be  neutral,  and  to  associate  themselves  with  a  view  to  acquire 
strength by unity and to use  the  strength so  acquired  in working out their social and 
political  emancipation." 

T he  Congress  P r o g r a m m e. 

It  was  then  agreed  that  at  the  next  and  subsequent  meetings  of  the  Council  the 
questions  to  be  submitted  to  the  Geneva  Congress  should  be  discussed  and  elabo 
rated. 

The  questions  to  be  discussed  on  Tuesday  next  are  as  follow.—Organization  of 
the  Association;  Combination  of effort  by  means  of the  Association  in  the  different 
national  struggles  between  capital  and  labour. 
The  Council  then  adjourned  to  July  24.

436 

Meeting  of the  Centrai  Council  July  24,  1866 

bring  forward  questions  and  formally  propose  them.  Also  that  reports  of proceed

That  the  CC  should  sit  in  London,  seconded  by  Marx.  Carried  Unanimously. 
The  next  question  discussed  was  ways  and  means. 
Cremer  proposed  for  discussion  "That  Corporate  bodies  joining  the  Association 
should  contribute  one  halfpenny  per  Member  per  Year  to  the  CC  for  the  purposes

Aug. 8,  1866. 

Sir,—The  result  of your  attendance  on  the  Coachmakers'  Friendly  Society,  Berwick 
Street,  to-night  has been,  that we  have  appointed ten  Delegates  to wait upon  the  ten 
Societies  in  connection  with  our trade,  to  lay  before  each  Society your  circular  and 
explain  it to  them,  taking  your own lucid  statement  as  our  "model."  I  have  been  de 
sired  by  the  sub-committee  (the  ten)  to  request  you  to  forward  twenty-four  circu 
lars,  addresses,  and  rules,  so  that we  may  forward  a  copy  to  each  of those  Societies 
and  so  that  each  of us  may  have  a  copy  to  "read  up"  in  before  we  wait  upon  them; 
our  object  is  to  endeavour  to  get  each  to  act,  as  we  intend  to  try  and  make  our  So 
ciety  act  in  unity  with  you.  I  suppose  you  will  receive  a  note  from  our  secretary 
(Mr. Todd),  explaining  that  your  circular  and  explanations  cannot  be  brought  be 
fore  our  Society,  until  its  general  meeting  in  January,  when  we  intend  that  the  In 
ternational  Working  Men's  Society's  claims  shall  have  the  preference  to  all  other 
business,  and,  if in  the  meantime,  the  other  Societies  can  be  urged  to  do  likewise, 
the  time  will  not  have  been  altogether  wasted.  I  hope  to  come  amongst  you  as  a 
united  body. 

Wishing  you  every  success  in  your  (our)  undertaking,  allow  me  to  subscribe  my 

self,  your  well-wisher,  and  hope  to  be  your  obedient  servant.

The  Gen  Sec  stated  that  it  was  not  his  province  to  prepare  balance-sheets  al 
though  he  had  done  so  months  ago  and  Mr  Coulson  had  been  appointed  Auditor 
but had  never attended.  If there was  any neglect or delay  it was  with those  who  had

Meeting  of the  Central  Council  August  14,  1866 

Lyons  W o r k m e n,  the  War,  a nd  the  British  Reform  M o v e m e n t. 

The  Lyons  correspondent  of the  International Working  Men's  Association  writes  to 
the  Central  Council  of this  Association  as  follows:— 

"Lyons,  August  9,  1866. 
In  respect  to  the  war,  opinions  are  unsettled.  However,  workingmen  are  beginning 
to  throw  off that  narrow  patriotism  which  made  them  embrace  the  quarrels  of pot 
entates  and  edged  them  in to  sacrifice  themselves  for the  interests  of the  former.  All 
are  beginning  to  see  that  their  interests  and  ours  are  not  identical,  and  that  all 
working  men  have  a  common  interest,  and  that  their greatest  enemies  are  the  para 
sites  of their  own  nation. 

We  received  some  numbers  of the  Courrier Français,  and  we  liked  well  the  ideas  it 

propagated. 

Our enemies  found  a  pretext  for annihilating  it,  but  they  could  not  annihilate  the 

ideas  it  represented. 

We  live  in  hopes  that  other journals  will  resume  the  work  it  left  unfinished.  The 
arbitrary  rule  which  governs  us  does  not  wish  the  truth  to  penetrate  into  the  prov 
inces.  We  beg  the  English  working  classes  to  persevere  in  the  attitude  which  they 
have  recently  assumed;  let  them  show  themselves  determined  and  courageous,  let 
them  confront  all  menaces  and  they  will  obtain  that  reform  which  is  the  first  step 
towards  social  amelioration. 

You  will  oblige  us  by  giving  us  some  details  concerning  what  has  taken  place  in 
London,  and  indicating  to  us  clearly  the  spirit  which  animates  this  movement,  for 
journals  suppress  the  essential  part  of it. 

I  cordially  salute  you, 

An. 

Scheitel." 

Cit  Fox  also  read  Letters  from  Bordeaux  and  Vienne  (Isère).  The  latter  asked  for 
130  Cards  of Membership,  also  that  the  following  should  be  appointed  Correspond 
ents  for  that  department  Citizens  Ailloux,  Waguenay  and  Marcheval. 

Cits  Dupont  and  Le  Lubez  proposed  their  election.  Carried  Unanimously. 

Election  of  C o u n c i l m en 

Cit  Lafargue  proposed  Cit  Le  Maitre  as  a  Member  of CC. 

A  discussion  took place  on  the  proposition,  his  election  having been  on  a former 

occasion  opposed  by  5  of his  W o r k m e n-

Cits  Marx  and  Lubez  proposed  That  an  official  Letter  be  sent  to  the  five  Men  ] 

|[157]|  and  the  election  postponed. 

Cits  Hales  and Yarrow proposed That  they  be written  to  to  come  before  Standing 

Committee  at  8  o'Clock.  Carried  Unanimously.

They  suggested  that  the  General  Secretary  be  paid  40s  per  Week  and  to  be  ap 

pointed  by  the  Geneva  Congress  itself. 

A  discussion  took  place  on  the  proposition  which  was  opposed  by  Cit  Dell  who 
preferred  a  graduated  scale  of payment.  An  amendment  was  proposed  to  the  effect 
that  30s  be  the  rate  of payment  but  the  amendment was  withdrawn  and  the  resolu 
tion  was  Carried  Unanimously. 

Cit  Dell  read  a  Letter  he  had  written  in  reply  to  Mr  Coulson,  the  letter  was  en 

dorsed  by  the  Council  and  ordered  to  be  sent.

Cit  Eccarius  reported  that  the  Tailors  had  that  night  decided  to  send  a  Delegate  to

The  first  business  was  the 

R e p o r ts  of  D e p u t a t i o n s. 

Cit.  Jung  reported  that  he  had  waited  on  the  Cigar  Makers'  Committee,  who  had 
convened  a general  meeting  of the  members  to  receive  a  deputation  from  the  coun 
cil.  He  had  also  waited  on  the  Scale  Makers,  and  had  arranged  to  visit  them  a  sec 
ond  time.  He  further  reported  visits  to  the  Tin  Plate  Workers  and  Curriers,  both 
committees  courteously  received  him  and  promised  to  bring  the  question  before 
the  next  general  meeting. | 

|[158]| The  general secretary,  Cit.  Cremer,  reported  that himself,  Citizens Lessner, 
Haufe,  Massman,  and  Yarrow  had  waited  on  the  Organ  Builders  and  Upholsterers, 
and  had  been  requested  to  attend  their  next  general  meetings.  The  secretary  also 
stated  that  the  Alliance  Cabinet  Makers  had  at  a  general  meeting  recommended  a 
levy  of 6d.  per  member  towards  the  expenses  of the  Geneva  Congress. 

Citizens  Weston  and  Hales  reported  that  they  had  waited  on  the  Brass  Finishers, 
and  discussed  with  the  members  the  principles  of the  association.  They  had  been 
invited  to  attend  again. 

Cit.  Le  Lubez  reported  his  visit  to  the  Stove  Makers.  They  had  urged  him  to  at 

tend  their  general  meeting. 

T he  G e n e va  Congress. 

Some  further  arrangements,  in  connection  with  the  above,  were  then  made,  when 
the  Council proceeded  to  discuss  the  report  of the  disturbances  between  the  English 
and  Belgian  excavators  at  Eastbourne.  The  general  secretary  was  ordered  to  get  all 
the  information  possible  on  the  matter,  if necessary  to  take  action,  and  to  report  at 
the  next  sitting  of the  Council.

T he  M a n c h e s t er  Tailors'  Lock-out. 

Cits.  Lessner  and  Lawrence  reported  that  700  tailors  were  locked  out  in  Manches 
ter,  and  fearing  their  late  employers  might  try  to  get  men  from  the  Continent,  they 
invoked  the  assistance  of the  International  Working  Men's  Association  on  their  be 
half.  As  some  doubts  were  expressed  in  relation  to  the  continuance  of the  lock-out, 
it was  agreed  to  suspend  any  continental  action until  the  arrival  of confirmatory  in 
telligence  from  Manchester;  but  in  case  of danger,  the  secretary was  to  act  immedi 
ately. 

I n t e r n a t i o n al  Postal  R a t e s. 

The  following  resolution  was  then  proposed  by  Citizens  Cremer  and  Lessner— 
"That the  delegates  at  the  Geneva Congress be  requested to urge  on their respective 
governments  the  necessity  and  advantages  of a  system  of International  and  Ocean 
Penny  Postage."  In  proposing  the  resolution  Cit.  Cremer  said  that the  realisation  of 
such  a  project  would  greatly  facilitate  the  efforts  of the  association  in  bringing  into 
fraternal  intercourse  the  workmen  of the  world.  At  present  the  postal  rates  were  so 
high  as  to  preclude  the  possibility  of frequent  communication.  The  resolution  was 
carried  unanimously. 

Report  of  Standing  C o m m i t t e e. 

Cit.  Jung brought up  the  report,  which  report  contained  a  proposition to  be  submit

That  9  Hours  per  Day  including  1  hour  per  Day  for  Meal-times  be  the  standard 

Day's  w o r k-

As  an  Amendment  Cremer  proposed  and  Lawrence  seconded 
That  Eight  Hours  be  recommended  as  the  standard  for  Daily  labor.  The  Amend 

ment  was  Carried  Unanimously. 

After  some  further  discussion  in  reference  to  that  part  of the  report  which  con 
tained  recommendation  as  to  the  employment  of Women  and  Children,  the  further 
consideration  of the  report  was  deferred  till  the  next  sitting. 

The  Council then  adjourned  till Tuesday  evening  next,  at  7  o'clock,  then  to  meet 
for  the  purpose  of discussing  and  finally  deciding  on  the  Congress  programme,  and 
to  elect  the  delegates  from  the  Central  Council. 

The  Secretary  was  ordered  to  summon  all  the  members.

International  Working  Men's  Association. 

The  Central  Council  met  on  Tuesday  evening  at  18,  Bouverie-street,  when  Mr. Lee, 
the  secretary  of the  Excavators'  Society,  attended  to  report  to  the  Council the  cause 
of the  late  disturbances  between  the 

5 

English  a nd  Belgian  Excavators. 

Mr. Lee  said  an  agent  of Waring  Brothers  had  succeeded  in  inducing  430  Belgian 
workmen  to  come  to  England  and  work  for  less  wages  than  the  English  workmen 
were  being  paid,  and  the  result  had  been  that  several  Englishmen  had  been  forced 
out  of  employment  to  make  way  for  the  cheaper  labour  of  the  Belgians.  The  430 
0  were made  up  of excavators,  carpenters,  and Blacksmiths.  The Belgians were receiv 
ing from 2s.  4d.  to  3s.  per  day,  while  the wages  of the  Englishmen were from  3s.  9d. 
to  4s.  per  day.  This  lowering  of wages  by  the  Belgians  had  caused  the  late  disturb 
ances,  which  he  and  his  brother  members  regretted.  They  were  ready  to  receive  the 
Belgians  into  their  society.  He  also  wished  to  ask  on what  terms  the  excavators'  so-
ciety  which  numbered  several  thousands  could  join  the  International  Working 
Men's  Association,  after  the  question  had  been  answered,  and  the  whole  matter 
fully  discussed,  it  was  resolved—"That  in  case  the  excavators'  society  take  steps  to 
form  a  branch  in  the  district  where  the  disturbance  occurred,  that  the  central  coun 
cil send  a  delegate  speaking  the  Belgian  language  to  accompany the  excavators'  del-
'0  egates  to  induce  the  Belgians  to  join  the  excavators'  society,  also  that  the  central 
council  use  its  influence  to  prevent  the  importation  of  any  more  Belgians  at  such 
reduced  prices."

Der  Social-Demokrat. 
Nr. 24,  19. Februar 1865 

Aus  den  Reden,  welche  auf dem  Stiftungsfest  gehalten  wurden,  will  ich  nur  einiges 
von  Karl  Marx  erwähnen.  Ueber  die  Streitfrage  von  Selbst-  und  Staatshülfe,  sagte 
er,  beide  Parteien  sind  im  Irrthum.  In  der  bürgerlichen  Gesellschaft  gehören  alle 
Lebens-  sowohl  als  alle  Arbeitsmittel  den  Kapitalisten,  daher  ist  die  Selbsthülfe 
5  Unsinn.  Auf  der  andern  Seite  ist  es  selbstverständlich,  daß  unter  einem  Ministe 
rium  Bismarck  von  keiner  Staatshülfe  die  Rede  sein  kann,  -  die  Arbeiter  können 
sich  nicht  an  das  Ministerium  Bismarck  verkaufen.  Die  Staatshülfe  kann  nur  von 
einem  Staate  ausgehen,  in  welchem  das  Proletariat  die  Oberherrschaft  führt.  Die 
Emancipation  der  Arbeit  innerhalb  der  preußischen  Monarchie  zu  predigen,  hieße 
•0  den  Sturm  in  einem  Glase  Wasser  beschwören.  Die  Emancipation  der  Arbeit  be 
dingt  die  Befreiung  Deutschlands,  diese  die  Herstellung  Polens  und  den  Sturz  der 
preußischen  Monarchie.  Auf  die  Vorwürfe  der  Fortschrittspartei  in  Bezug  auf  das 
Betragen  der  Arbeiter  gegen  die  Bourgeoisie,  sagte  Marx,  daß  zur  Zeit,  wo  er  ge 
schrieben,  daß  sich  die  Arbeiter  mit  der  Bourgeoisie  vereinigen  müßten  gegen  den 
15  Absolutismus, man vorausgesetzt habe,  daß die deutsche Bourgeoisie wenigstens  so 
viel durchsetzen werde,  als  die  Bourgeoisie von  England  durchgesetzt  habe,  dies  sei 
jedoch  nicht  der  Fall.  In  Deutschland,  speciell  in  Preußen,  bestehe  ein  Preßgesetz, 
wonach  alle  Schmähungen und  Verläumdungen  von  oben  nach  unten  frei  seien;  er 
fügte  hinzu,  daß  die Arbeiter-Zeitungen,  sowie  die  Arbeiterbewegung,  nur mit poli-
20  zeilicher  Bewilligung  existirten  und  man  die  Regierung  nur  mit  Sammt-Pfoten  an 
greifen dürfe.  Unter solchen Umständen sei  eine  gemeinsame  Aktion  zwischen  den 
Arbeitern  und  der  Bourgeoisie  unmöglich,  um  so  mehr,  da  die  Bourgeoisie  zu  feig 
sei,  ihr  eigenes  Programm  durchzuführen.

[l|  Meeting  of the  Standing  Committee 
with  the  Continental  Delegates  Sept'r  25 

Present  of  the  Standing  Committee  Cits  Jung,  Marx,  Dell,  Weston,  Howell,  Bob 
czynski, V. P. Eccarius and the  Hon Gen  Sec.  From Paris  Cits Tolain,  Fribourg,  Li-
5  mousin,  Schily,  Varlin,  Clarion  and  Dumesnil-Marigny,  Switzerland  Cits  Dupleix 

and  Becker,  Belgium  Caesar  De  Paepe. 

The  Meeting  having  waited  till  a  %  past  3  for  the  arrival  of the  President  and  he 
being  still  absent  Cit  Jung  was  voted  to  the  Chair.  He  began  by  stating  that the  first 
business  was  the  financial  position  of the  Association. 

10 

The  Gen  Sec  stated  that  the  accounts  of the  Association  had  been  audited up  to 
March  last  and  at  that  time  the  Accounts  stood  as  follows:  Income 
Expendi 
,  since  that  period  there  had  been  ||2|  no  audit  but  there 
ture 
would  be  another  at  the  end  of this  month  and  then  the  Balance  Sheet  would  be 
sent  to  the  different  Branches,  probably  up  to  the  present  time  the  income  of  the 

Balance 

15  Association  was  about  32  or  33£. 

Cit  Fribourg  gave  account  of Financial  position  in  Paris,  the  administration  had 
disposed  of  a  large  number  of Cards  but  as  they  had  been  compelled  to  keep  up  a 
Central  Office  and  had  been  put  to  great  expense  by  the  travelling  of the  Delegates 
etc.  there  was  little  or  no  balance  to  hand  over  to  the  CC,  still  the  prospects  were 
20  hopeful  as  the  chief expenses  had  been  defrayed  and the  future  contributions  would 
be  chiefly  clear income  to  be  handed  over  to  the  CC,  they  still had  about  400  Cards 
of  Membership  undisposed  of.  A  great  drawback  to  their  progress  had  been  the 
postponement  of the  Congress,  also  that  many  of the  workmen were  doubtful  if any 
thing  could  be  done  under  the  present  regime,  they  were  constantly  met  with  the 

25  statement  show  us  you  can  act  and  we  will join  you. 

He,  Cit  Fribourg,  ||3|  wished  the  English particularly  to  understand  their  difficul 
ties,  they  could  only  meet  in  small  numbers  of not  more  than  20,  if more  met  they 
were  liable  to  be  arrested,  a  short  time  ago  they  had  a  Meeting  of 60  and  they  had 
the greatest  difficulty  to  keep  them together from  8  till  10  o'clock,  they  kept looking 
30  at  the  door  expecting  to  see  the  Police  enter  to  arrest  them,  he  mentioned  this  to 
show  the  difficulties  they  had  to  contend  with,  the  books  and  accounts  of the  Paris 
Administration  they  had  brought  with  them  and  they  invited  the  Treasurer  to  in-
spect  them.

Minutes  of the  London  Conference  of the  I.W.M.A. 

Cit  Tolain  stated  they  had  enrolled  Members  in  Rouen,  Nantes,  Elbceuf,  Caen, 
Lisieux,  St.  Denis,  Pantin  and  Puteaux  but  in  all  those  places  their  progress  had 
been  hindered  by  the  postponement  of the  Congress. 

Cit  Schily  said  they  had  a  great  advantage  in  Switzerland  where  they  met  and 
contributed  monthly  while  in. France  they  had  to  get  together  as  best  they  could 
and  collect  the  Funds  in  the  same  manner. | 

5 

\4\  Cits  Cremer and  Marx proposed  That  Cits  Dell,  Jung,  and  Dupont go  over the 
Paris  accounts  and  report  to  the  next  Meeting  of the  Standing  Committee.  Carried 
Unanimously. 

Cit  Dupleix  reported  of  doings  in  Switzerland,  they  had  been  formed  but  10 

6  Months  but had  been  successful,  the  Contributions  at present were  5d  per  Month 
but  the  Members  were  willing  to  pay  if  necessary  Is  per  Month,  they  would  have 
had  a good  surplus  to  pay  over  to  the  CC  but for the  expenses  of the  Delegates  trav 
elling.  They  had  enrolled  in  Geneva  250  Men,  in  Lausanne  150,  Vevey  150,  the 
Men  were  quite  impressed  with  the  necessity  for  contributing  to  the  CC  and  were  15 
even  willing  to  dissolve  their  own  organisations  and  to  belong  alone  to  the  I.W.M.A. 
Cit  Schily  called  attention  to  the  Necessity  for  facilities  being  provided  whereby 
the  Workmen  of  different  countries  in  removing  their  domicile  would  receive  as 
sistance  and  also  that  the  Secretaries  in  different  Places  should  be  able  to  assist 
Workmen,  members  of the  Association,  to  obtain  employment. | 

20' 

|5|  Cit  De  Paepe  gave  report  of doings  in Belgium,  they  had  been  constituted  but 
1  month  but  had  already  60  Members  who  had  agreed  to  pay  not  less  than  3  francs 
or 2s  8d per year and  out of that  they  will  contribute  Is per year to  the  CC,  they had 
but  24s  subscribed  when  the  question  came  before  them  of electing  a  Delegate  but 
even  with  their small organisation  and  limited  means  they  had  elected  him  to  come  25* 
to  the  Conference. 

Cit  Fribourg  objected  to  the  Belgium proposition  as  to  a  fixed  contribution  of Is 
per Member  to  the  CC,  he  thought  some  years  there  might  be  a  large  contribution, 
in  fact  a  plethora,  and  in  other  years  there  would  be  a  dearth,  that  when  the  funds 
were  large  they  would  be  used  locally. 

30; 

Cit Marx replied  that the  Congress would  decide year by year  as  to  the  disposal of 

Funds. 

Cit  Tolain  said  that  in  Switzerland  and  Belgium  they  could  meet  openly,  discuss 
any  question  and  openly  enroll  Members  but  in  France  they  could  only  meet  by 
stealth  and  had  no  means  of openly  propagating  the  principles  of the  ||6|  Associa-  35;. 
tion  and  therefore  could  not  reach  or  inspire  with  Confidence  those  to  whom  they 
were  personally  unknown. 

This  concluded  the  report  of the  Financial  position. 
The  question  of ways  and  means  was  then  discussed. 
Cit  Becker  representing  the  German  section  in  Switzerland  proposed  Cit  Schily  40*· 

seconded  that  a  medal  should  be  struck  commemorative  of the  Meeting  of the  Con 
ference,  such  Medals  could  be  struck  off for  about  Id  and  could  be  sold  for  say  ód 
which  would  leave  a  good  margin  of profit  for  the  Association  and  help  to  pay  its 
expenses  and  be  a  means  of propagandism. 

-;. 

Fribourg  thought  it  better  that  an  approximate  estimate  should  be  formed  as  to  45j

the  probable  expenses  of the  Central  Council  up  to  the  period  of the  Congress,  also 
the  expenses  of  the  Congress,  and  that  an  attempt  should  be  made  to  raise  the 
money  through  the  members. 

5 

Cremer  agreed  with  Fribourg  and  thought  if  they  stated  what  the  amount  was 
likely  to  be  and  then  issue  Collecting  Cards  for  Subscriptions  of  Id  then  by  that 
means  they  might  ||[7]|  raise  the  amount,  he  did  not  think  the  assembling  of  the 
Conference  was  of sufficient  importance  to  impress  the  masses  with  a wish to  com 
memorate  it,  he  thought  the  question  of striking  off a  medal  should  be  left  till  the 
Congress  when  the  Association  would  be  more  known  and  when  it  should  have 
10  done  something  worth  commemorating,  he  thought  the  medal  a  premature  ques 
tion,  and  as  it  was  by  collecting  Pence  that  the  Religious  Bodies  raised  the  greater 
part of the  money  for  propagandista,  he  thought that  in this  instance we  might  with 
benefit  borrow  their  plan  of action,  ||[8]|  there  were  hundreds  who  would  give  one 
Penny but would  not  give  a  Shilling,  he  had  no  doubt  as  to  their being  able  to  raise 
the  necessary  amount  if they  went  earnestly  to  work. 

15 

Limousin  supported  Fribourg's  view.  The  proposition  for  a  Medal  was  also  sup 
ported  by  Dell  and  Weston  who  said  that  it  had  been  done  with  success  in  Robert 
Owen's  movement. 

Bobczynski  supported  the  issue  of a  medal  but  would  have  different  qualities  and 
20  prices,  to  those  who  should  subscribe  liberally  to  the  Association  and  become  life 
Members,  he  would  charge  2s  6d  so  that  they  might  wear  it  on  public  occasions. 

Eccarius  opposed  the  issue  of a  Medal  and  said  as  we  were  about to  engage  in  a 

battle  we  had  better  wait  and  see  if we  had  a  victory  to  commemorate. 

25 

Marx  was  against  fixing  any  amount  as  proposed  by  Fribourg. 
Howell  opposed  the  Medal,  he  thought  it  would  be  unsuccessful. 
Finally  the  following  Resolution  was  agreed  to  on  the  propositions  of  Cit  Marx 

and  Dupont: 

That  the  propositions  of the  Belgian  Delegate  to  send  Is  per  Member  per  annum, 
the  Swiss  a  fixed  amount,  the  French  the  main  proceeds  of  the  sale  of  cards  (in-
30  eluding the  400  they have  in hand)  to  the  Central  Council,  be accepted  and  that  the 
further  consideration  of the  financial  position  be  adjourned  till  after  the  soiree. 

Carried  unanimously. 
The  Meeting  then  adjourned  till  tomorrow  at  2  o'clock.  |

|l|  Sitting  of the  Conference 
Monday,  Sept.  25th  1865 

The  Sub-Committee  having  sat  with  the  Delegates  till  half  past  5,  the  members 
were  not  present  in  large  numbers  until  near  8  o'clock,  when  the  proceedings  com 
menced  under  the  Presidency  of  Citizen  Odger,  Citizen  Jung  being  elected  Vice-
Chairman  to  interpret  and  translate. 

Cit.  Odger  rose  and  addressed  the  Meeting.  He  said  there  [were]  present  repre 
sentatives  of France,  Italy,  Belgium,  Switzerland,  Germany,  Poland  and  Spain.  He 
said  that  the  English  Workmen  were  seeking  for  the  Franchise  and  it  was  difficult 
to  make  them  think  of anything  else—thence  the  slowness  with which  the  Associa 
tion  has  progressed  in  England.  When  we  have  shown to  the  English people  that we 
are  doing  some  work,  they  will  have  confidence  in  us  and join  the  Association  but 
they  have  been  so  often  deceived  that  they  are  slow  in  giving  their  confidence.  He 
then  declared  the  Conference  duly  open. 

A  proposition  was  put  and  carried  unanimously  that  the  Meetings  of the  confer 

ence  take  place  at  8  o'clock. 

Cit  Cremer  addressed  the  Meeting  on  the  position  of the  Trade  Societies  in  Eng 
land.  People  on  the  Continent may  think  them very  rich  and  able  to  contribute  to  a 
cause  which  ||2|  is  their  own,  but  they  are  tied  down  by  petty  rules  which  confine 
them  to  very  narrow  limits.  They  are  difficult  to  move  and,  but  for  a  few  men  that 
are  among  them,  they  are  not  worth  anything  for  what  they  may  do  for  their  own 
emancipation  or  that  of their  fellow-men.  They  know  nothing  of Politics  and  they 
are  difficult  to  be  made  to  understand  that  there  is  such  a  science.  However,  there 
was  a  beginning  of progress.  A  few years  ago,  Delegates  from our Association  would 
not  have  been  allowed  a  hearing;  now  we  are  well  received,  listened  to  and  our 
principles  unanimously  approved  of.  That  is  the  first  time  that  an  Association  hav 
ing  anything  to  do  with  Politics  was  accepted  by  the  Trades  Unions. 

Cit.  Fribourg,  French  Delegate,  said  that  the  Association  had  been  well  received 
in  France;  1,200  cards  of membership  had  been  taken  in  Paris,  though  they  could 
not  meet,  but  they  act  individually  and  they  hope  the  Association  will  acquire  a 
great  extension. 

Cit  Dupont  read  the  following  letter from  Lyons—Also  a  Letter from  Citizen Tal--

460 

Sitting  of the  Conference  September 25,  1865 

bot,  of Caen,  who  approves  of the  intervention  in  favor  of Poland  but  especially  in 
sists  on  curtailing  the  power of Russia—He  shudders  at  the  idea  that  by  rail  it  only 
requires  47  hours  to  come  from  St.  Petersburg  to  Strasburg.  | 

|3|  Citizen  Tolain,  from  Paris,  spoke  of the  state  of  Societies  in  Paris—He  said 
that  whereas  in  '48  the  Political  events  urged  the  people  on  to  move  and  to  act, 
now,  events  are  against  action,  but  action  takes  place  notwithstanding  and  even 
against  the  force  of events.  The  Social  questions  are  being  studied  and  elaborated. 
People,  he  said,  undergo  two  phases:  the  Political  and  the  Social.  They  are  perfect 
ing  the  latter. 

Cit.  Dupleix,  from the  French part  of Switzerland.  He  said  the  Branch began with 
60  members;  it  now  numbers  400—They  feel  that  the  time  has  come  when  work 
men  must  work  their  own  emancipation  by  their  own  exertions.  At  Geneva,  they 
have  made  an  appeal  to  the  Benefit  Societies.  3  Societies  have  already joined—He 
related  that  at  Montreux  an  act  of reparation  had  been  done  by  the  influence  of the 
Association. 

Herr  Becker,  the  Representative  from  the  German  part  of  Switzerland,  said  that 
in  Geneva  alone  1,500  had  already  joined.  Benefit  Societies  started  last  summer 
and  were  organising  themselves  into  an union  of Societies,  but  hearing  of the  Inter 
national Association,  they  took  that as  their connecting link.  His  speech was  full  of 
warmth  and  eloquence  and  much  applauded  by  those  who  understood  the  German 
Language.  | 

|4|  Citizen  Cesar  De  Paepe,  Delegate  from  Belgium,  related  a  History  of the  va 
rious  Associations.  Two  years  ago,  an  International  Association  was  formed,  but  it 
had  too  much  of the  Middle  Class  element  in  it—It  broke  up.  Now,  there  are  three 
kinds  of parties  in  Belgium:  the  Revolutionists  who  simply  want  to  upset  the  exist 
ing  state  of things—the  Socialists  who  make  a  study  of the  miseries  of the  people, 
their  causes  and  the  means  of bringing  a  remedy  to  them—then,  some  other  Socie 
ties  very  like  the  Trade  Unions  in  England,  who  limit  their  aspirations  to  being 
ready  to  strike  for  a  few  halfpence. 

Then  there  are  a  large  number  of  Societies  of  Freethinkers  whose  sole  mission 
seems to  be  to  oppose  the  Clergy.—He, the worthy  Delegate,  said  that  he  looked  on 
co-operation  as  only  a  partial  remedy—Then,  there  was  the  Credit-Mutual.  But,  he 
looked upon  Landed  Property  as  the  question  to  be  taken  in  hand.  As  it  stood,  pau 
perism  must  go  on  increasing  according  to  a  law  now  known  "that  pauperism  in 
creased  in  the  same  ratio  as  wealth"!  Land  like  air  belonged  to  all,  its  fruits  must 
belong  to  those who  cause  them  to  be  produced—but  land  itself must not  belong  to 
anyone. | 

|5|  C o n t i n u a t i on  of  M o n d a y 's  Conference 

The  question  of  the  Newspaper  was  then  discussed.  Cit.  Vésinier  said  that  the 
Newspaper  ought  to  appear  once  a month  in  a  double  number—the  extra  part  being 
published  in  three  languages  and  reporting  the  doings  of the  Association. 

Cit.  Schily  said  that  the  Workman's  Advocate  should  have  a  sub-title  as  the  or-

461 

Minutes  of the  London  Conference of the  I. W. M. A. 

gan  of the  Association.  Citizens  Marx,  Bolleter,  Le  Lubez  and  others  took  part  in 
the  discussion  after which  Citizen  Becker  proposed  and  Le  Lubez  seconded  that  the 
Workman's  Advocate  be  recognised  as  the  organ  of the  Association. 

On  the  question  of  Foreign  Correspondence  it  was  decided  that  foreign  Corre 
spondence  sent  by  Delegates  should  be  received  for  our Newspaper,  compiled  by  a 
Commission  and  published—The  Foreign  Delegates  took  the  engagement  to  send 
Correspondence. | 

[Auszug  aus  The  Workman's  Advocate] 

The  Workman's Advocate. 
Nr. 134, 30. September 1865 

A  Conference  of Delegates  from  France,  Belgium,  Switzerland,  Poland,  Germany, 
and  Italy,  and  the  English  representatives  from  the  various  societies,  affiliated  with 
the  central  body  in  England,  opened  on  Monday  last. 

The  delegates  of the  several  nationalities  first  met  at  3  o'clock,  at  the  Freema 
son's  Arms,  Long  Acre,  for  mutual  introduction,  and  preliminary  matters  of busi 
ness  and  finance. 

The  following  delegates  gave  in their credentials:—France,  Messieurs  Schily,  Fri 
bourg,  Tolain,  Varlin,  Limousin  and  Clarion;  Switzerland,  Dupleix  and  Becker; 
Belgium,  Cassar  De  Paepe;  also  Dumesnil-Marigny,  Dr.  Marx,  Eccarius,  Lessner, 
Kaub,  Schapper,  Vesinier,  Dupont,  Le  Lubez,  Jung,  Major  Wolff,  Bobczynski, 
Lochner,  Bolleter,  etc., from the  various  French,  German,  Italian,  Swiss,  and  Polish 
societies  in  this  country;  together  with  the  various  English  delegates,  as  Cremer, 
Dell,  Odger,  Weston,  Howell,  Shaw,  Wheeler,  etc.,  etc.,  representing  their  central 
and  affiliating  bodies. 

After  some  business  of  a  preliminary  character,  the  delegates  adjourned  to  8, 

Adelphi-terrace,  Strand,  where  the  Conference  was  held. 

The  Conference  assembled  in  the  large  room  of the  Reform  League,  at  7  o'clock. 
Mr.  Geo.  Odger,  in  the  chair.  He  stated  that  delegates  were  present  from  France, 
Switzerland,  Germany,  Belgium,  Spain,  and  Italy,  together  with  the  English  repre 
sentatives  of the  various  affiliated  bodies.  Their  progress  (he  continued)  had  been 
most  encouraging,  and  their  prospects  were  most  favourable.  Their  efforts  had  been 
directed  to  the  various  questions  stated  in  the  programme  before  the  Confer 
ence,  and  he  had  no  hesitation  in  saying  that  their  progress  had  been  so  far  satis 
factory. 

Mr.  Cremer,  the  General  Corresponding  Secretary,  explained  the  position  of the 
English  sections  of the  Association;  he  said,  that  for  many  years  the  English  work 
men  had  not  taken  an  active  part  in  politics,  having  confined  their  efforts  to  social 
questions,  and  those  more  particularly  affecting  the  interests  of capital  and  labour. 
But  the  leading  spirits  of the  English  societies  had  now  identified  themselves  with 
the  leading  questions  of the  day,  and  were  steadily  but  surely  moving  great  masses 
of their fellow-countrymen  in  the  same  direction.  They  had  already  done  something 
in  international  movements  and  he  had  no  doubt  of their  ultimate  triumph.

Sitting  of the  Conference  September 25,  1865 

Möns.  Fribourg  (Paris  delegate)  said,  the  difficulties  of the French  members were 
very  great.  They  could  not  meet  as  in  England,  for  if twenty  only  met  together  the 
eye  of the  Government  was  suspiciously  upon  them.  They  had  once  as  many  as 
sixty  of their  members  at  a  meeting,  but  had  the  greatest  difficulty  in  keeping  them 
together,  for  they  were  continually  expecting  to  see  the  police  enter  the  door.  They 
had no  trades'  or political  organizations  as  in  this  country,  so  it  was  to  them  a  pur 
suit  of progress  under  difficulties. 

5 

Möns.  Dupont  next  reported  from  Lyons,  they  were  glad  that  the  intended  Con 
gress  in  Belgium  had  been  postponed  till  next  year,  and  this  Conference  was  being 
10  held in its  stead.  They wished their brother delegates  (Confrères)  to understand that 
their  own  efforts  must  work  out  their  own  redemption.  The  principles  to  be  em 
ployed  were  moral  force,  justice,  and  truth.  They  had  great  difficulties  but  labour 
would  conquer  them.  In  Lyons  they  would  work  to  that  end,  and  give  the  fraternal 
hand  of fellowship  to  their  brother  toilers  all  over  the  world. 

.  15 

Another  French  delegate  (Talbot,  the  correspondent  of the  department  of Calva 

dos)  reported  from  that  part  of France. 

In  reference  to  the  topics  on  the  programme,  there  is  but  one  feeling  on  the  sub 
ject  of Poland.  They  felt that  no  great  good  could  be  done  for  Europe  till  the  power 
of Russia was  crippled.  Finland  should  again  be  given  to  the  sea,  and  Poland  re-es-
tablished  in  her independence.  They  shuddered  at the  thought  of Russia's  vast  and 
still  increasing  power  in  Europe.  Her  vast  armies  make  peace  but  a  dream. 

20 

Möns.  Tolain  (the  late  working  men's  candidate  for  the  department  of the  Seine) 
said:  Of late  years  the  workmen  had  been  impelled  onward  in  the  path  of  progress 
by an  irresistible  force;  they had  now  arrived  at  that point that they were  themselves 
25  pressing  forward  in  spite  of a  considerable  force,  tending  to  keep  them  nailed  to 
their  present  position.  In  France  they  were  paying  great  attention  to  social  ques 
tions,  which  he  (the  speaker)  looked  upon  as  most  important  just  now,  under  the 
present  regime,  and  likely  to  produce  the  most  momentous  political  results.  (The 
translator  to  the  Conference  said  the  speech  just  made  was  a  most  beautiful  and 

.  30  eloquent  one,  and  he  felt  ashamed  of his  own  feeble  attempt  at  translation.) 

Möns.  Dupleix,  one  of the  Swiss  delegates,  next reported  from  Switzerland.  They 
had  large  societies  in  Neuchâtel,  Geneva,  Montreux,  Vevey,  and  Lausanne.  They 
had  already  done  much  good  in  Switzerland,  and  in  one  town—Montreux—had 
been  the  means  of bringing  an  employer  to justice  for  a  breach  of contract,  and  an 
infringement  of their  laws. 

35 

M. Becker,  from  the  German  part  of  Switzerland,  said  they  had  three  nationali 
ties  and  three  languages  in  their  country,  and  had  published  their  address  in 
French,  Swiss,  and  German.  They  had  already  done  good  service  in  their  country, 
through  the  International  Association,  and  would  work  still  harder  in  the  future. 
40  They were  in favour of Polish nationality  as  a political  question,  and  of co-operative 
labour  as  a  social  one,  capable  of great  good  for  working  men.  They  were  opposed 
to  private  property  in  land. 

M.  De  Paepe  (Belgium)  said  they  had  only fairly  started  about  six weeks,  but  they 
anticipated  great  results.  Their  country,  unhappily,  was  very  much  divided  into 
»'·  45  classes  of  different  shades  of opinion;  but  they  hoped  to  make  this  a  great  move-

merit.  They  were  not  prepared  to  say  that  co-operation would  regenerate  humanity, 
but  it  might  aid  their  cause.  They  were  not  quite  in  favour  of the  Polish  movement, 
as  some were;  for it seemed so  powerless  that the  sacrifices were  all  on  one  side.  On 
the  whole  they  thoroughly  favoured  the  movement  of the  International Association. 
Several  foreign  delegates  spoke  in  favour  of  a  recognised  international  organ,  to 
communicate  their views  to  their fellow workers  throughout Europe,  and  indeed  the 
world.  Arrangements  were  then  made  to  adopt  an  organ,  and  make  it  the  medium 
for  disseminating  their views.  Several  delegates  remarked  that  no  weekly  paper  had 
a  foreign  correspondence,  whereas  their  paper would  be  able  to  produce  the  best  in 
the  world.  Dr.  Marx  and  others  were  elected  as  conductors  of this  department.

|l|  Meeting  of  Standing  Committee 
with  Continental  Delegates  September  26 

Citizen  Jung  in  the  chair,  present  of the  Standing  Committee  Eccarius,  Marx,  Wes 
ton,  Cremer,  Howell  and Jung,  the whole  of the  Continental  Delegates were present. 

The  question  of  finance  was  again  discussed. 
Cremer  proposed  Howell  seconded—That  we  recommend  to  the  Conference  to 
pledge  itself in  the  name  of the  Association  to  raise  150£  for  the  purpose  of propa-
gandism  and  the  expenses  of the  Congress,  and  that  it  be  left  to  this  Body  to  appor 
tion  the  respective  amounts  to  be  raised  by  the  different  Nationalities.  Carried 
Unanimously. 

The  question  of a  General  Congress  was  next  discussed. 
Marx in  the  name  of the  Central  Council proposed  that  the  Congress  assemble  in 
Geneva.  Dupleix  seconded  the  proposition.  Fribourg  wished  it  recorded  that  the 
French  Delegates  had received  instructions  to  propose  Geneva  instead  of as  hereto 
fore  decided  Belgium  as  a  protest  against  the  law  passed  in  Belgium  with  regard  to 
foreigners.  The  resolution  was  Carried  Unanimously. 

De  Paepe  proposed  Tolain  seconded  That  the  following  be  submitted  to  the  Con 

ference  this  evening: 

That  the  Conference  transfer  the  place  of Meeting  of the  Congress  from  Belgium 
to Geneva  as  a  solemn protest  against  the  Law  concerning  Foreigners  passed  in  Bel 
gium. 

Carried  Unanimously. 

The  period  for  the  assembling  of the  Congress  was  next  discussed. 
Marx  and  Cremer in  the  name  of the  Central  Council  proposed  that  it  take  place 
in  September  or  October  of next  Year  unless  unforeseen  circumstances  shall  occur 
to  necessitate  its  further  postponement. 

The  Delegates  from  Paris  as  an  amendment  proposed,  That  the  Congress  assem 
ble  on  the  first  Sunday  in April  next year.  They  all  declared  that to  longer  postpone 
the  Congress  would  be  fatal  to  the  Association  in  France,  and  Tolain  opposed  any 
discretionary  power  being  given  to  the  Central  Council  on  the  question. 

Schily  thought  the  French  Delegates  exaggerated  ||2|  the  urgency  for  the  Con 

gress. 

De  Paepe  said  that  if  the  Congress  was  held  too  soon  they  could  not  send  Del-

465 

Minutes of the  London  Conference of the I. W. M. A. 

egates  from  Belgium,  they  were  now  in  debt  and  it  would  take  them  some  time  to 
recover  themselves,  he  supported  the  resolution. 

The  French  Delegates  were  willing  to  give  a  little  further  time,  they  would  agree 

to  the  Month  of May. 

Marx was  impressed  by  the  statements  of the  French  Delegates  and  was  inclined 

to  withdraw  the  resolution. 

Cremer  thought  we  had  not  made  propagandism  in  Germany,  Spain,  Italy  and 
that  our  efforts  should  be  exerted  in  that  direction  as  a  Congress  of the  Working 
Men  of Europe  would  be  incomplete  without  representatives  from  those  Nationali 
ties. 

Schily  thought  the  Paris  Administration  were  putting  the  knife  to  the  throat  of 

the  Association  and  if they  were  not  very  careful  they  would  kill  it. 

Limousin  said  the  present regime  caused  the  Workmen  to  distrust  each  other and 

thereby  increased  their  difficulties. 

Jung  said  French  Delegates  must  take  all  the  responsibility  on  themselves  if the 
Congress  was  a  failure,  he  would  suggest June  instead  of May  as  the  spring  was  late 
in  Switzerland. 

The  French  Delegates  would  so  far  yield  as  to  agree  to  the  last  week  in  May. 
Marx  having  withdrawn  his  proposition  for  September  the  amendment  became 

the  resolution  and  was  unanimously  agreed  to. 

The  following  were  then  appointed  to  speak  at  the  Soiree,  Tolain,  Dupleix, 

Becker,  Bobczynski,  and  Jones. 

The  next  question  discussed  was  the  organisation  of the  Association. 
Dupleix  wished  to  know  how  the  Association  was  to  be  formed. 
Limousin  thought  it  was  not  within  the  province  of the  Conference  to  decide  the 

question,  he  thought  a  Congress  alone  could  decide  it. 

Fribourg  and  Dupleix  proposed  That  the  organisation  of  the  Association  is  a 

question  for  the  Congress.  Carried  Unanimously. 

Marx  and  Fribourg  proposed  That  the  following  questions  be  submitted  to  the 
Congress  "Cooperative Labor",  "Reduction  of the number of the  ||3|  hours  of labor", 
"Female  and  Child  labor",  all  present  voted  for  them  as  questions  but  Weston— 

Marx  and  Fribourg  proposed  the  following  for  the  Congress  "Direct  and  indirect 

taxation",  agreed  to. 

The  following  questions  marked  3,  4  and  10  on  the  programme  were  also  agreed 

to. 

3.—Combination  of  effort  by  means  of  the  Association  in  the  different  national 

struggles  between  Capital  and  Labour. 

4.—Trades'  unions—their  past,  present,  and  future. 
10.—Standing  armies:  their  effects  upon  the  interests  of  the  productive  classes. 
The  Members  then  adjourned  till  tomorrow,  the  27,  at  2  o'clock. |

Meeting  of the  Conference 
Tuesday  evening,  at  8  o'clock 

Cit  Odger  in  the  Chair,  Citizen  Jung  Vice  Chairman  and  interpreter. 

Cit.  Cremer  read  the  reports  of the  two  previous  sittings  of the  Sub-Committee, 
and  the  questions  resolved  upon  in  that  department  were  submitted  to  the  Confer 
ence— 

Is'  That  the  sum  of £150  be  raised  for  the  purpose  of Propagandism  and  to  get  up 

the  Congress.  Carried  unanimously— 

2nd  That  the  Congress  be  held  in  Geneva.  Carried  unanimously— 
3rd That  it be  recorded  that the  cause  why  the  place  where  the  Congress  was  to  be 
held  is  changed  from  Brussels  to  Geneva,  is  the  Uncivilised  and  Inhuman  Law 
passed  in  Belgium  for  the  expulsion  of  illustrious  Foreigners.  Carried  Unani 
mously. 

4th  That  the  Meeting  of the  Congress  be  fixed  for  next  May. 
This  was  strongly  opposed  by  Cit.  Le  Lubez  who  said  there  was  not  time  suffi 
cient to  make the  Congress  a  success  by  that  time;  a  long  discussion  followed—The 
Paris  Delegates  insisting  on  the  absolute  necessity  of having  it  not  later  than  that. 
Carried  by  a  large  majority—Citizens  Hansen  and  Lessner voting  against  it.  Cit.  Le 
Lubez  abstaining  from  voting. 

5th  The  questions  that  are  to  be  discussed  at  the  Congress.  Cit.  Le  Lubez  asked 

that  each  question  be  put  separately. 

The  Is'  question  was  supposed  to  have  been  disposed  of,  so  the  2nd was  submitted 
to  the  meeting  and  carried.  But  Cit.  Le  Lubez  having  asked  to  return  to  the  Is'  of 
the  questions  in  order  to  decide  what  would  be  the  mode  of admission  to  the  Con 
gress— 

Cit.  Vésinier  asked  what  would  be  the  rights  of those  who  would  attend  and who 
were  to  vote?  The  Paris  Delegates  said  that  all  those  who  have  a  card  must  be  enti 
tled  to  all  the  rights  of Discussion  and  of voting—They  made  it  a  matter  of princi 
ple  and  said  it  was  universal  suffrage. 

Citizen  Cremer  urged  that  the  Congress  should  be  composed  exclusively  of Re 
presentative  men  and  he  made  a  Resolution  to  the  effect  that  all  the  Adhering 
Branches  of the  International  Association  might  send  Delegates  and  that  any  other 
society  of Working-men,  having  been  established  more  than  3  months  previous  to 

467 

Minutes of the  London  Conference of the  I. W. M. A. 

the  Assembling  of  the  Congress,  might  send  Delegates  who  would  have  the  same 
rights  as  the  Delegates  of  the  International  Association.  The  Paris  Delegates,  | 
)[2]|  then,  withdrew  their proposition.  A  great  deal  of opposition  was  shown  to  the 
latter part  of Cit.  Cremer's  proposition,  "the  admitting  of Representatives  of any  or 
ganised  Societies  who  had  not  adhered  to  the  Principles  of the  International  Asso 
ciation,  to  vote  and  to  have  the  same  influence  on  its  destiny  as  the  Delegates  from 
the  Central  Council  and  of the  Branch  Societies". 

Citizen  Vésinier  then  proposed  that  any  member  of the  Association,  having  his 
card,  or  any well known  Citizen  who  shall  be  proposed  by  two  members  to  the  Cen 
tral  Council  or  to  the  Council  of any  of the  Branches,  and  who  is  accepted  by  them 
or  any  one  of them,  shall  be  entitled  to  all  the  rights  of the  Delegates  to  the  Con 
gress. 

Citizen  Dupleix  said  that  in  Geneva  they  invited  members  of other  Societies  to 
their Meetings  and  that  they  allowed  them  to  take  part  in  the  Discussion  but  not to 
vote.  He  recommended  the  same  course  for  the  Congress—He  also  said  that  special 
cards  should  be  issued  and  charged  for  to  those  who  wished  to  assist  at  the  Con 
g r e s s-

Citizen  Caesar  De  Paepe  proposed  that  the  right  of voting  be  given  to  Delegated 
Members  of the  Association—that  everyone  be  admitted  to  speak  but  not  to  vote. 
Citizens  Carter,  Eccarius,  Tolain,  Fribourg,  Limousin  (who  said  that  all  those  who 
attended  should  vote),  Wheeler,  Leno,  Lassassie  and  others  took  part  in  the  discus 
sion  when  Cit.  Cremer's  proposition  was  divided;  and,  the  first  part  being  put  was 
carried—Citizens  Vésinier  and  De  Paepe  voting  against  it. 

A discussion  then  followed  with regard  to  the  second  part  of the  proposition—the 
admission  of all  Delegates,  of any  Workmen's  Society,  to  have  the  right  to  attend  25 
"i 
and  to  vote— 
,. 

Cit  Vésinier  made  an  earnest  appeal  to  the  members  to  beware  of Bonapartists 
who  most  certainly  could  get  any  number  of their  partisans  elected  as  Representa 
tives  and  out-vote us  at  the  Congress.  Cit.  Tolain  said  he  did  not  think  Bonapartism 
was  so  dangerous  as  some  people  would  make  it—he  thought  it  was  much  magni-  30 
fied. 

Eventually  Citizen  Cremer  withdrew  the  second  part  of his  proposition— 
Each  of the  remaining  propositions,  the  3 r d,  4t h,  5t h,  6th,  7t h,  8th  and  10th  were  put 

and  voted—the  9th  was  put  off till  the  next  day— 

The  Meeting  then  adjourned. |

Nr. 134, 30. September 1865 

[Zu  S. 467.14-19] 

The  following  resolutions  were  passed:  [...] 

"That  the  congress  assemble  in  May  of next  year." 

468 

Sitting  of the  Conference  September  26,  1865 

Upon  the  last  mentioned,  considerable  discussion  took  place,  some  being  in  fa 
vour of September  of next  year,  instead  of May.  But ultimately  the  resolutions  were 
adopted.  The  haste  was  chiefly  due  to  the  French  delegates,  who  insisted  that  the 
postponement  of  the  congress  would  be  fatal  to  the  association  in  France.  They 
cannot meet  to  plan  and  discuss,  but  must  at once  either  abandon  a  scheme,  or put 
it in  practice.  They  therefore  are  in favour of May  next.  It  having  been  explained  to 
the  delegates  that  it  was  a  matter  of life  and  death  to  the  French  Association  that 
the  Congress  should  be  no  longer  delayed  the  resolution  was  carried  unanimously. 

5 

[Zu  S. 467.22-468.32] 

10 

It  was  then  moved  by  Mr.  Cremer,  seconded  by  Mr.  Eccarius,—"That  the  congress 
shall  consist  of  representative  men  only,  who  shall  bring  credentials  properly  au 
thenticated  by  the  citizens  deputing them;  and  further,  that  each delegate  shall rep 
resent  a  branch  of  the  Association  or  not  less  than  thirty  working  men,  who  shall 
have  been  organised  for not  less  than  three  months  previously  to  the  assembling  of 

15  the congress." 

Upon  this  resolution  an  animated  discussion  took  place.  Fribourg  opposed  any 
society  being  present,  except  those  belonging  to  the  Association.  But  would  allow 
all  members  the  privilege  of  attending  and  taking  part  in  the  deliberations  of the 
congress. 

20 

Vesinier  thought  every  member  should  have  the  right  to  meet  and  vote. 
Cope  said  every  delegate  attending  the  congress  should  send  his  credentials  at 

least  seven  days  [beforehand]  to  the  nearest  branch  of the  Association. 

[De]  Paepe,  was  in  favour  of  all  members  attending  and  speaking  but  delegates 
only  should  vote.  They  would  be  able  to  accommodate  the  Conference  with  five 

25  hundred  voters  from  across  the  French  frontier,  if it  were  open  voting. 

Limousin  was  in  favour  of open  speaking  and  open  voting. 
Lassassie,  was  not  in  favour  of open  doors;  the  French  people  knew  little  of open 
discussion  or  they  would  not  support  it.  With  open  doors  it  would  last  six  months. 
No,  delegates  only  must  speak  and  vote. 

) 

Dupleix  thought  no  harm  would  be  done  if members  attended  the  congress,  but 

they  should  take  no  part  in  the  proceedings. 

Mr.  Cremer was  in  favour of open  doors  in  the  same  sense  as  our  House  of Com 
mons,  but  none  but  representatives  should  take  any  part  in  speaking  or voting.  The 
plan  advocated  by  the  French  delegates  would  destroy  its  representative  character 
5  altogether.  If  it  were  representative  in  its  character,  the  people  of  Europe  would 
pause  to  listen  to  its  deliberations,  but  if not  it  would  be  looked  upon with  derision 
and  scorn.  He  could  not  understand  the  Parisian  delegates  objecting  to  such  a  sys 
tem,  for  upon  any  other  basis  the  congress  would  be  a  farce. 

Tolain  was  in  favour  of perfect  equality,  both  to  speak  and  vote.  If Bonapartism 
0  sought to  influence their deliberations,  they would grapple  with  it  in open  congress. 

But  it  was  not  so  bad  as  it  appeared,  or  as  it  was  painted. 

Carter was  in  favour  of Mr.  Cremer's  amendment,  but  desired  to  see  the  question 

postponed. 

469 

Minutes of the  London  Conference of the  I. W. M. A. 

Schily  would  vote  in  favour of the  proposition.  Bonapartism,  if it  sought  to  influ 

ence  our  deliberations,  would  sail  under  our  colours. 

Howell urged  those  present to  well  consider before  they  destroyed  the  representa 
tive  character  of the  congress.  Would  it  be  right  to  allow  a  man  who  only  paid  his 
shilling,  and  had  no  delegated  authority,  to  outvote  another  man  sent  by  five  hun 
dred  members?  Would  they  have  been  satisfied  if the  Conference  had  been  filled 
with  English  delegates,  so  as  to  overpower  the  voice  and  authority  of the  continen 
tal  representatives?  Yet  this  was  the  meaning  of the  proposition.  He  should  vote  for 
the  amendment. 

The  question  was  further discussed  by  Mr.  Weston  and  others,  ultimately  the  fol 
lowing  amendment  of Mr.  Shaw was  carried  unanimously  (Mr.  Cremer having with 
drawn  the  last  clause  of his  amendment),  "That  the  congress  shall  consist  of repre 
sentative  men  only,  who  shall  bring  credentials  properly  authenticated  by  the 
branches  of the  association  deputing  them."

|[1]| Conference of Wednesday evening 
Sept.  27th  1865 

Cit.  Odger  in  the  chair,  Cit.  Jung  translator  and  Vice  Chairman.  Cit.  Marx read  the 
report  from  the  meeting  of  the  permanent  Committee  and  the  Delegates.  Cit.  Le

them.  They  were  passed  unanimously. 

The  following  resolutions  came  from  the  preallable  meeting  of the  afternoon  and 

proposed  as  fit  questions  to  be  put  before  the  Congress: 

1st  Res.  That  a  Meeting  be  held  in  Geneva  after  the  Congress—Carried  unani-

10  mously. 

2nd  That  the  question  of giving  relief to  the  sick,  orphans  and  old  people  be  sub 
mitted  to  the  Congress.  Citizen  Cremer  supported  that  idea  very  strongly,  saying 
that  material  benefits  are  the  greatest  link,  for  the  present,  to  hold  out  to  Societies 
in  this  Country.  He  hoped  the  Association  would  seriously  take  up  the  question. 

15  Carried  unanimously. 

3rd  The  formation  of International  Credit  Societies.  It  was  said  that  those  Socie 
ties  might  be  of immense  service—It  appears  that  in  France  these  Societies  are  al 
lowed,  but  as under an  absolute  Government no  funds were  safe  from its  grasp,  they 
would  be  glad  of finding  a  secure  place  for  their  funds  in  England.  Carried  Unani-

20  mously. 

25 

4th That  it  is  imperative  to  annihilate  the  invading  influence  of Russia  in  Europe 
by  applying  to  Poland  "the  right  of every  people  to  dispose  of itself",  and  re-estab 
lishing  that  country  on  a  Social  and  Democratic  basis.  Cit.  Le  Lubez  proposed 
that the  latter part of the  proposition  only be  retained,  i.e.  "that peoples have  a right 
to  dispose  of  themselves".  He  said  that  it  would  be  affirming  the  same  principle, 
but  upon  a  broader,  in  fact  a  universal  basis.  Citizen  Weston,  in  seconding  the 
amendment,  said  he  was  opposed  to  the  introduction  of any  but  social  questions. 
He  said  we  ought  to  do  one  thing  at  a  time,  and  do  it well.  Cit.  De  Paepe  said  that 
he  did  not  think  the  question  ought  to  be  introduced  at  all.  The  re-establishment  of 
30  Poland  could  only  benefit  3  classes:  the  High  Nobility,  the  low  Nobility  and  the 
Clergy—As  to  the  serfs  they  had  little  to  hope  for.  "You  want  to  check  Russian  in-
fluence,"  said  the  orator,  "which  influence?  That  of  the  Government?  Then  I  ask 

471 

Minutes  of the  London  Conference of the  I. W. M. A. 

that  the  influence  of all  governments  in  Europe  be  checked.  Is  the  influence  of the 
Prussian,  Austrian,  English  and  French  Governments  less  baneful  ||[2]|  than  that  of 
Russia?  I  say  no.  But  if you  mean  to  check  the  influence  of  the  Russian  people, 
then  I  say  that  they  are  the  same  as  any  other people.  Indeed  there  is  a  movement 
going  on  among  the  working  peasants  by  which  they  claim  'the  land  and  liberty'. 
Then,  there  are  so  many  people  who  suffer  that  it  is  almost  unjust  to  name  but 
one."  He  moved  that  the  question  be  not  entertained.  Cit.  Wheeler  warmly  sup 
ported  the  resolution—He  said  that  Russia  had  always  been  a  stumbling  block  in 
the  way  of progress.  Despotism  was  horrible  anywhere,  but  that  of Russia  was  the 
most  cruel.  Cit.  Lassassie  thought we  had  better see  the  intense  misery  and  tyranny 
under  which  the  people  in  these  countries  laboured  than  go  so  far  to  look  for 
wrongs.  Governments  wished  for  our  minds  to  be  directed  to  far-off  questions,  it 
prevented  us  from  seeing  the  tyranny  at  home;  he  insisted  on  Ireland  being  freed 
from  English  yoke.  Capt.  Bobczynski  in  a  very  able  and  eloquent  speech  answered 
the  objections  that  had  been  raised  against  the  Resolution.  Poland,  he  said,  had 
fought the  longest,  had  been  the  longer oppressed,  her sons  had  shed  their  blood  on 
every  battle-field  where  right was  struggling  against might.  Poland  is  the  key-note  to 
European  freedom—she  must  be  Democratic  and  she  declares  for  the  freedom  of 
all.  The  President  said  that  it  was  at  a  meeting  in  favour  of  Poland,  held  at  St. 
James'  Hall,  that  the  French  and  English  Workmen  first  met  fraternally  together; 
we must  support Poland:  to us,  it was the type  of oppressed Nations.  Cit.  Carter said 
that  to  deal  with  social  questions  and  leave  political  ones  untouched,  was  to  deal 
with  a  headless  body,  or  a  body without  a  soul—He  did  not  know where  Despotism 
would  stop  if the  voice  of humanity  was  not  raised  against  it.  He  was  in  favour  of 
the  proposition.  After a  very  long  discussion,  the  Chairman  put  it:  That  it  be  not en 
tertained,  only  seven  voted  for,  and  10  against.  For  Cit  Le  Lubez'  proposition 
10—for  the  original  proposition  23.  Citizen  Vésinier  asked  the  following  names  be 
added  to  Poland—Rome,  Venice,  Hungary,  France,  Ireland,  Mexico  and  others, 
but  the  Chairman  told  him  he  was  out  of order—that  the  question  was  settled. 

5th Res.  The  Religious  idea;  its relation  to  social,  political  and  intellectual  devel 
opment  of the  people.  Cit.  Carter moved  that  it  be  not  entertained.  He  said  that  we 
had  nothing  to  do  with  dogmas  or  creeds,  that  each  individual  must  have  full  lib 
erty  to judge  for  himself,  and  that  there  should  be  no  interference  between  a  man's 
conscience  and his  god.  Cit Le  Lubez  said  that  he  wished  there  was no  interference, 
then  we  should  have  no  priests  or  parsons,  but  the  latter  existed,  the  other  side  of 
the  question  must  be  made  known— 

Cit  Fribourg  supported  the  Resolution—Cit  Holtorp  also  supported  it.  Cit.  Wes 
ton  made  an  earnest  appeal  to  the  Meeting  not  to  entertain  the  question.  Cit.  Ho 
well  said  it  was  our  duty  to  study  this  question,  not  in  narrow,  sectarian  point  of 
view,  but  as  a  philosophic  principle.  In  England,  it  had  been  the  custom  to  con 
demn  all  discussions  of  Religious  or  Political  questions.  |([3]|  that  is  the  reason 
there  were  so few who  understood  those  questions:  thence our slow progress.  But we 
must  have  them  carefully  studied  as  they  greatly  affect  our  welfare.  Cit.  De  Paepe 
said  that  the  men  who  in  Catholic  countries  go  and  kneel  to  a  fellow  man  are  not 
the  men  to  be  relied  on  for the  carrying  out  of their own  emancipation—Those who 

472 

Sitting  of the  Conference  September 27,  1865 

believed  in a Being of some  kind  who was  always  above  them and whose humble  in 
struments  they  believe  they  are,  always  feel  themselves  low,  and  are  not  the  likely 
men  to  become  independent. 

Cit.  Tolain  said  that  the  programme  would  be  incomplete  without  that  proposi-

5 

tion. 

Cit.  Weston  again  appealed  to  the  Meeting  not  to  admit  that  apple  of discord. 
For  the  amendment  13—for  the  proposition  18. 
The  Meeting  then  separated. |

[Zu  S. 471.21-472.29] 

The  Workman's  Advocate. 
Nr. 134, 30. September 1865 

Proposed  by  Bobczynski,  seconded  by  Wheeler,  "That  it  is  imperatively  necessary 
to  annihilate  the  influence  of Russia  in  Europe  by  applying  to  Poland  the  right  of 
every  people  to  dispose  of  itself,  and  to  re-establish  that  country  upon  its  native 
democratic  basis." 

15 

Proposed  by  Le  Lubez,  seconded  by  Weston,  in  an  energetic  speech,  "That  the 
latter  part  of the  proposition  only  do  pass,  that  is,  in  reference  to  the  right  of every 
people  to  settle  its  own  form  of government." 

Weston  would  have  no  proposition  embodying  a  political  question,  but  stick  to 
social  ones,  as  he  believed  that  to  do  things  well,  they  must  do  one  at  a  time.  He 
thought  the  political  would  introduce  dissention. 

20 

De  Paepe  said  the  watchwords  of the  Russian  peasants  were  "Land  and  Liberty", 
and  should  be  the  watchwords  of the  Polish  peasant  also.  But  he  wished  to  know  if 
it  was  the  power  of the  Russian  people  or  the  Russian  government,  that  strove  to 
blot  Poland  from  the  map  of  Europe?  If  it  be  the  Russian  government,  then  the 
25  French government was quite as dangerous to liberty as the Russian.  It was their in 
fluence  which  procured  the  passing  of  that  abominable  act  against  foreigners  in 
Belgium  which  rendered  necessary  the  removal  of  the  Congress  to  Geneva.  He 
moved  "That  the  question  be  not  entertained."  Seconded  by  Bordage. 

Wheeler,  in  an  eloquent  speech,  supported  the  resolution,  as  Russian  despotism 
30  was the most blighting  in  the world.  It rested not till  its  opponents  were blotted  out, 
as  in  Circassia,  and  Poland,  was  now  being  done.  He  denounced  despotism  every 
where;  but  Russian  was  most  cruel  and  dangerous  to  Europe. 

Lassassie  thought  we  need  not  go  to  Poland,  as  there  was  plenty  of work  to  be 
done  at home.  Misery  and  tyranny  were  in  our  midst;  let us first  reform these,  and 
then attack foreign  questions. 

35 

Bobczynski  very  ably  and  eloquently  answered  the  objections  against  the  Polish 
question.  They  had  the  first  claim,  on  account  of  their  long  and  earnest  battle 
against might;  their  arms  had  served  in  every  other  cause.  In  France,  Hungary,  and 
Italy,  her  sons  fought  heroically  in  the  cause  of European  liberty.  Her  sons  wanted 

473 

Minutes  of the  London  Conference of the  I. W. M. A. 

to be free; that was the key to their earnest, but,  alas,  almost useless struggles.  Inter 
national  sympathy  makes  no  distinction  between  peoples;  but  we  select  Poland  be 
cause  she  has  striven most  in  her own  cause.  She  had  tried  to fulfil  the  condition  of 
the  poet—"A  nation  to  be  free,  herself  must  strike  the  blow"—if  she  had  failed, 
cowardice was not  the  cause,  for  she  had  struck nobly  and well.  They must  not sepa 
rate  social  and  political  questions,  for  political  reforms  must  be  the  precursor  of so 
cial  advancement,  they  are  inevitably  bound  up  together  and  cannot  be  separated. 
Poland  is  the  key  note  to  European freedom;  she  is  democratic  or nothing;  she  de 
clares  for  freedom  for  all.  This  speech  was  very  warmly  applauded. 

The  Chairman  explained  that  in  reality  Poland  brought  their Association  into  ex 
istence,  as  they  would  see  by  the  following  extract  from  their  address:—"Let  our 
first  united  efforts  be  for  the  freedom  of  Poland;  the  justness  of  their  cause  de 
mands  it,  treaty  obligations  make  it  imperative,  and  duty  points  the  way." We  must, 
he  said,  stand  or  fall  by  the  Polish  cause. 

Carter  thought  Poland  eminently  deserving  the  first  consideration.  Their  case 
was  the  worst,  and  was  infecting  the  whole  of Europe.  It  was  their  political  plague 
spot,  and  should  at  once  receive  attention,  to  prevent  the  spread  of the  disease.  To 
adopt  social  questions,  and  leave  political  ones  untouched,  was  to  deal with  a head 
less  body,  or  a  body  without  its  animating  soul.  Poland  must  be  dealt  with. 

The  Chairman  then  put  it  to  the  vote.  That  it  be  not  entertained  was  lost  by  a 
large  majority.  That  the  latter part  only  of the  proposition  be  taken,  was  also  lost  by 
a  large  majority.  For  the  proposition  in  its  entirety,  the  majority  was  overwhelming. 
Vesinier  wanted  to  protest  against  Poland  being  accepted  when  so  many  other 

nationalities  were  in  a  similar  position. 

But  the  Chairman  ruled  that  it  was  out  of order.  He  had  already  taken  six  votes 

on  the  question,  and  heard  nearly  two  dozen  speeches. 

[Zu  S.  472.30-473.7] 

"The  religious  idea:  its  relation  to  the  social,  political,  and  intellectual  develope-
ment  of  the  people."  [...] 

Fribourg  supported  its  discussion.  They  were  neither materialists  nor brutes.  The 

question  was  an  important  one,  and  must  be  entertained. 
Holtorp  supported  its  retention  in  the  programme. 
Howell  favoured  the  discussion  of  this  question,  not  as  a  narrow  and  sectarian 
one  to  be  tabooed,  but  as  a philosophic  principle underlying  all other questions.  In 
England  it  had  been  the  custom  to  condemn  all  polemical  and  political  discus 
sions;  this  was  one  reason  of our  slow  progress.  If it  were  to  be  made  the  means  of 
attacking  men's  religious  opinions,  he  would  condemn  its  introduction.  But  the 
time  must come  when  they would  have  to  calmly  consider religion  as  an  ethical and 
philosophic  principle  inwoven  with  every  social  and  political  movement. 
Weston  strongly  condemned  it,  as  tending  to  destroy  the  association. 
De  Paepe  was  in  favour  of the  proposition,  but  it  must  not  be  viewed  through  a 

fanatic's  eye  belonging  to  either  the  Romish  or  Protestant  churches. 

474

Tolain  thought  if it  were  left  out  it would  be  a  sign  of weakness.  It was  necessary 
to  retain  it  to  complete  our programme.  We  shall  then  stand  on  the  broad  basis  of 
social,  political,  and  religious  progress. 

It  was  then  put  to  the  conference,  and  carried  by  a  small  majority.

ported  by  Dupleix  and  De  Paepe  and  Carried  unanimously. 

That  the  £150  be  raised  by  the  different  Nationalities  in  the  following  propor

to  be  sent  by  the  Central  Council  on  account  of  his  services  to  the  Association.

Citizen  Whitehead  was  elected  as  the  delegate  from  the  French  Polishers'  So 

ciety,  which  meets  at  the  Black  Horse  in  Rathbone  Place,  Oxford  Street,  W. 

Citizen  Fox  read  a  Letter  from  Mr  Lee  the  Secretary  of the  Excavators'  Society 
and  in  consequence  of its  contents,  Citizens  Whitehead,  Lafargue  and  Dutton were 
appointed  to  form  a deputation  to  wait  upon  the  Excavators'  Society  on  the  follow 
ing  Friday. 

Citizen  Marx  stated  that  the  notice  of  the  Manchester  Tailors'  Strike  had  been 
inserted  in  the  Democratic  Journals  in  the  North,  South  and  Centre  of Germany; 
he gave  a  list  of those  Journals.  Citizen  Lawrence  stated  that  the  struggle  had  closed

|2|  T he  Delegates'  Report 

As  it  appeared  that  only  Cits.  Odger,  Lawrence,  Eccarius,  and  Carter had  returned, 
it was  thought  best  to  defer  the  reception  of the  official  report  untili  after  the  return 
[of]  Cits.  Cremer,  Jung,  and  Dupont;  but  the  delegates  were  invited  to  give  an  unof 
ficial  extempore  narrative  of what  took  place. 

Citizen  Odger  gave  a  glowing  account  of the  welcome  given  by  the  Genevese  to 
the  delegates,  and  declared  that  the  general  results  of  the  Congress  had  far  ex 
ceeded  his  anticipations.  He  declared  that  Cit.  Jung's  conduct  as  president  had 
given  general  satisfaction. 

479 

Minutes of the  General  Council  of the  I. W. M. A. 

After  the  British  delegates  had  left  Geneva  they  repaired  to  Berne  to  have  an  in 
terview  with  the  Federal  Government  of Switzerland  on  the  subject  of cheap  inter 
national  postage.  The  delegates  saw  the  Foreign  Secretary  and  the  Postmaster-Gen 
eral.  They  were  first  of  all  very  courteously  shown  over  the  Federal  palace  and  the 
picture  Gallery,  and  Museum.  Their  interview  with  the  Post-Master-General  of the 
Helvetic  Confederation  lasted  about  half-an-hour.  He  entirely  coincided  with  the 
views  of the  delegates  on  this  subject,  and  said  that  the  Swiss  Government  was  of 
the  same  opinion  as  the  International  Working-men's  Association. 

Cits.  Cremer  and  Jung  remained  behind  at  Neuchâtel  to  help  Dr  Coullery  in 
propagandist work  on  behalf of the  association.  It  had  been  the  intention  of the  del 
egates  to  have  stayed  for  a  time  in  Paris  to  observe  the  progress  of the  co-operative 
companies  of production  there,  and  Cit.  Lawrence  had  desired  to  see  some  of his 
trade  (the  Tailors)  there,  but  the  arrest  on  the  frontier  of a  Parisian  delegate  return 
ing from the  Congress for having  in  his possession  a  "seditious"  ||3|  anti-Napoleonic 
pamphlet  persuaded  the  British  delegates  [to  abandon]  this  portion  of  their  plan. 
He  further  stated  that  although  the  Parisian  delegates  had  at  first  been  disposed  to 
offer  a  factious  opposition  yet  towards  the  end  they  had  acted  in  a  most  satisfactory 
manner  towards  the  British  delegates;  and  had  asked  their  opinions  on  several  of 
the  questions  involved. 

Citizen  Carter  then  made  his  statement.  He  said  that  the  Genevese  tailors  had 
been  addressed  by  Cit.  Lawrence,  he,  Carter interpreting;  the  Carpenters  by Cremer, 
Carter  interpreting;  and  the  shoemakers  by  Odger—Eccarius  interpreting.  The  two 
former  meetings  had  been  most  enthusiastic  and  crowded. 

Citizen  Eccarius  gave  a  more  detailed  account  of their  interview  with  the  Post-
Master-General  at  Berne.  The  Swiss  Government  was  ready  to  enter  into  an  agree 
ment  with  any  government  [provided]  that  each  country  should  retain  its  own  gen 
eral  postage  rate  and  that  the  intermediate  transit  should  be  charged  at  half baggage 
rates.  The  French  Government  was  the  great  obstacle  to  all  postal  Reform,  They 
would  not  allow  letters  to  be  charged  for in  bulk  but  insisted  upon  charging  and  in 
specting  the  address  on  every  letter.  The  Postmaster  General  was  of  opinion  that  31 
the  letter  rate  between  Great  Britain  and  Switzerland  might  advantageously  be  re 
duced  from  6d  to  2%d  per  letter.  He  had  been  lately  trying  to  get  the  ordinary 
French letter rate raised from % oz to  % oz but without avail.  He was  also in favor of 
a  reform  of the  regulations  governing  book  and  pattern  posts. 

Eccarius had in his  "valise"  copies  of the  "seditious"  pamphlet for the possession  35 

of which  the  Parisian  delegate  had  been  arrested,  but  the  French  authorities  took 
no  notice  of  him,  presumably  because  he  was  looked  upon  as  a  Briton.  ||4|  He 
added  that  eight  workingmen  had  appeared  (from  Paris)  at  the  Congress  as  oppo 
nents  of  the  Administrative  party.  The  Congress  had  refused  to  hear  them  as  they 
were  not  accredited  by  any  organized  body  recognized  by  the  Association.  It  would  40-
be  a  suggestion  for  the  Central  Council  to  consider,  whether  considering  the  non 
existence  of the  right  of meeting  in  France,  this  Council might  not be  able  to  do for 
these  desiderante  what  they  could  not  do  for  themselves. 

'

Meeting  of the  General  Council  September  18,  1866 

from  all  parts  of Europe.  The  Congress  had  resolved  that  every  individual  member 
should  pay  3d.  per  head  this  year  towards  the  expenses  of the  Central  Council. 

Citizen  Lawrence  stated  some  incidents  of recent  struggles  at  Lausanne  between 
the  employer  and  the  employed  in the  shoemaking  trade,  and  how the  International 
association  had  played  a  leading  part  therein.  He  also  spoke  of their progress  in  the 
career  of  Co-operative  production.  He  noted  generally  that  on  the  Continent  the 
working  classes were  in  advance  of the  British  in  this  respect.  In Paris  there  were  54 
Co-operative  Manufacturing  Associations,  and  200  credit  Societies.  In the  business 
of Co-operative  Banking  the  Continentals  were  also  ahead  of us.  It had been  the  in 
tention  of  the  Parisian  members  of the  International  Workingmen's  association  to 
have given  a  dinner to  the  returning  British  delegates,  but the  aforesaid  arrest  threw 
a  damper  over  this  project.  He  confirmed  what  the  other  delegates  had  already 
stated  concerning  the  reign  of  terror  and  suspicion  now  prevalent  in  the  French 
capital. 

Citizen  Fox  complained  that  the  British  delegates  had  not  sent  from  Geneva  to 
the  ||5|  acting  Secretary  any  information  concerning  the  Congress  or  the  visit  to 
Berne;  and  the  consequence  was,  that  he  had  not  been  able  to  advertise  its  transac 
tions  in  the  London  Press  as  he  otherwise  could  have  done;  also,  that  several  of the 
Weeklies  had  copied  reports  from  the  French  press  so  that  in  some  respects  they 
were  better  informed  than  the  Commonwealth  of the  preceding  week.  Citizen  Ec 
carius  explained  that he  had  sent  an  account  of the  visit  to  Berne  to  the  Times,  but 
that paper had  refused to  insert it.  Odger and  Carter  explained,  that they had not re 
ceived  the  Journals  sent from  London  in  time  to  inform  them  of the  publicity  given 
to  the  transactions  of the  Congress  in  the  London  Press. 

Citizen  Marx  moved,  and  Dell  seconded  a  vote  of thanks  to  the  delegates  for  the 
able  manner  in which  they  had  represented  the  Central  Council  at  Geneva.  Carried 
amid  applause.  The  Council  then  adjourned  untili  next  Tuesday. /

/ 5/ Council Meeting  Sept.  25th 

Citizen  Eccarius  in  the  Chair. 

The  Secretary  read  the  minutes  of  the  previous  meeting  which  were  confirmed 

with  the  alteration  suggested  by  Lawrence. 

Citizen Marx  said  he  had  received £5.0.0,  the  annual  Contribution from  Mr  Sam 

uel  Moore  a  Manufacturer  of  Manchester. 

Cremer  stated  that the  Model  Pattern  Makers,  who  meet  at  119  Fenchurch  Street, 
had  asked  for  a  deputation  from  the  Council  to  wait  upon  them  on  Saturday  night. 
Weston,  Lessner  and  Whitehead  were  appointed  to  respond  to  this  appeal. | 

|6|  Whitehead  gave  an  account  of the  visit  of the  deputation  (of which  he  formed 
a  part)  to  the  Excavators,  who  meet  in  Bermondsey.  He  had  sold  several  copies  of 
the  Rules.  The  delegates  assembled  were  so  satisfied  that  they  undertook  to  report 
on  the  subject  to  the  different  Lodges  and  they  had  little  doubt  that  those  Lodges 
would  join  the  ranks  of our  associated  bodies. 

Jung  laid  on  the  table  a  copy  of the  Voix  de  l'Avenir  the  organ  of the Association 
in  Chaux  de  Fonds;  and  stated  that  the  Editor  desired  an  authorisation  from  the 
Central  Council  before  affixing  the  words  "Organ  of the  International  Association" 
on  the  title.  He  also  laid  on  the  table  a  copy  of "L'Ouvrier"  of Lausanne.  Cremer 
proposed  that  the  authorisation  be  given  and  spoke  enthusiastically  of Dr  Coullery 
the  Editor.  Carter  seconded  the  proposition,  Coullery  had  been  the  ruling  spirit  of 
the  Congress.  The  Chairman  endorsed  what  the  two  previous  speakers  had  said. 
Without  Coullery's  aid  the  London  programme  could  not  have  been  carried.  The 
motion  to  grant  the  authorisation  was  Carried  Unanimously. 

Order  of  Business 

As  the  delegates  from  London  to  the  Geneva  Congress  had  [not]  yet  prepared  their 
report  Lawrence  moved  and  Fox  seconded:  That  after  hearing  a  viva  voce  account 
from  Jung  and  Cremer  of the  result  of their  tour  after  they  had  separated  from  the 
other  delegates,  the  Council  should  proceed  to  the  election  of  officeholders.  Jung 
then  made  his  report.  On  Monday  Sept.  10th  he  went  with  Lawrence  to  Lausanne 

484 

Meeting  of the  General  Council  September  25,  1866

and  attended  a  meeting.  On  Tuesday  he  went  to  Berne  with  the  other  delegates.  Af 
terwards  went  to  Neuchâtel,  thence  with  Cremer  to  Chaux  de  Fonds  ||7|  and  St 
Imier:  addressed  a  meeting  at  the  latter  place,  went  back  again  to  Neuchâtel  and 
had  a  meeting  there.  Cremer  spoke  at  these  meetings  (Jung  interpreting).  He  had 
also  spoken  to  a leading member of the  Grütli Verein  in reference  to joining the  as 
sociation.  Cremer  then  stated  what  the  Congress  had  [decided]  with  reference  to 
the  Central  Council.  Congress  had  renewed  the  appointment  of every  actual  mem 
ber of the  Council  with the  exception  of Le  Lubez  who  was  excluded  on  the  motion 
[of]  Citizens  Fribourg  and  Tolain  because  he  had  continued  to  stigmatise  them  as 
intriguers  and  Buonapartists.  Le  Lubez  denied  having  called  them  Buonapartists. 
Carter  stated  that the  delegates  from  London  did  their very  best  to  retain  Le  Lubez; 
and  that  in  consequence  of  their  opposition  to  the  Tolain  and  Fribourg  demand 
those  two  Citizens  left  the  Hall,  Fribourg  in  a  theatrical  manner.  The  event  was  de 
cided  by  a  delegate  from Lyons  who  stated  that he  had  received  a  letter from  Le  Lu-
15  bez in which Fribourg  and Tolain were  abîmé.  The Lyonnais stated  that Le Lubez's 
representations  had  done  much  harm  to  the  progress  of  the  association  in  Lyons 
and  that  it  had  only  lately  recovered  from  the  ill  effects  of  the  same.  The  whole 
meeting voted  with the  Parisian  party  except the  London  delegation.  Only  then  did 
Tolain  and  Fribourg  return  to  the  Hall.

After a  short  discussion  Le  Lubez  rose  and  observed  that  there were  two  Nation 
alities  absent  [from]  the  Congress whose  representatives would  have  sided  with him, 
namely  Italy  and  Belgium;  Fribourg  and  Tolain  did  not  venture  to  attack  him  in 
London  [during]  the  epoch  of the  conference.  He  advised the  Central  ||8|  Council to 
obey  the  vote  of  the  Congress.  He  should  not  ask  for  readmission  to  the  Central 
25  Council untili the vote  of another Congress had reversed the verdict of that at Gene 
va.  He  thought  the  Council  ought  to  pass  a  vote  of  Confidence  in  him.  Had  the 
Parisians  paid  to  the  Council  the  debt  they  owed,  or  any  portion  of the  £40  prom 
ised  at  the  London  Conference.  He  understood  they  had  not.  Le  Lubez  then  left 
the  room.

Election  of  Officers 

President 
Lawrence  moved  that  Marx  be  President  for the  ensuing  twelve months;  Carter sec 
onded  that  nomination.  Marx  proposed  Odger;  he,  Marx,  thought  himself incapaci 
tated  because  he  was  a  head  worker  and  not  a  hand  worker.  Weston  seconded 

35  Odger,  a  ballot was  taken  and  Odger was  carried  by  15  v.  3.

Minutes of the  General  Council  of the  I. W. M. A. 

Lawrence  moved  that  the  appointment  of the  other  Secretaries  be  adjourned  un 

tili  next  week,  carried  by  common  consent. 

Marx  moved  that  a  Testimonial  be  presented  to  Cremer  for  his  almost  entirely 
gratuitous  services  as  Secretary  for  nearly  two  Years.  Seconded  by  Carter  and  by 
several  members  and  Carried  Unanimously. |

Marx  proposed  to  constitute  this  Committee  provisionally  only,  for the  present.  The 
Committee  to  consist  of  the  Officeholders  and  Secretaries  already  appointed.

/9/  Council  Meeting  October  2nd 

Lessner  in  the  Chair. 

The  minutes  of the  previous  meeting  were  read  and  confirmed  with  the  alteration 

suggested  by  Cit.  Carter.

The  Secretary  asked  for  and  obtained  the  permission  of the  Council  to  insert  in 
the  minutes  of  Sept  18th  a  portion  of  the  statement  made  by  Eccarius  which  had 
[been]  omitted,  but  which  on  reflection  he  thought  was  important. 

Fox  brought  forward  the  claim  of Mr  Miall  on  the  Council  for  rent  due  and  that 
we  should  henceforth  stand  to  him  in  the  place  of the  Industrial  Newspaper  Com-
10  pany. It was decided to pay the quarter's rent due last midsummer. There being noth 
ing  in  the  Treasury  the  Treasurer  advanced  the  quarter's  rent  by  way  of  a  Loan. 
Fox  having  asked  the  Treasurer  what  had  become  of  the  £5  received  last  week 
through the  hands  of Marx;  the  Treasurer replied  that £6  had been paid to  cover the 
unpaid  expenses  of the  Geneva  Delegates;  Carter  complained  that  he  had  been  un-
fairly  treated,  the  agreement  was  that  all  the  Delegates  should  share  and  share 
alike. I 

15 

|10|  Now  although  the  other  Delegates  knew  that  his  expenses  had  been  greater 
than theirs  owing to  his  having  to  travel  by mail Trains.  Yet he  had  only received  £8 
while  the  others had  received  £10.  Jung  made  an  explanation.  He  animadverted  on 
20  Cremer's  Conduct  in  reference  to  procuring  Tickets  before  starting.  He  stated  that 
he  had  advanced  Cremer  £2.  in  Geneva,  and  had  to  borrow  £4.  from  a  Friend.  He 
offered  to  refund  his  own  £2.  balance.  Carter  declined  with  thanks.  He  did  not  de 
sire  to  make  a  personal  attack;  but  only  to  show  that  an  equitable  rule  had  been  in 
fringed  in  reference  to  him. 

25 

Dell  observed  that  Cremer had  received  £10.12.1  or  12s  Id  more  than  any  other 

Delegate.

Report  of  D e p u t a t i on  to  M o d el  P a t t e rn  Makers 

Citizen  Whitehead  said  he  and  Citizen  Weston  had  waited  upon  the  Model  Pattern 
Makers.  They  were  well  received,  but  they  complained  that  Mr  Cremer had  not  no 
tified  the  advent of the  Deputation  to  the  Society.  They wished  that  Copies  of Rules 
be  sent  to  them— 

They  would  summon  a  special  meeting  to  consider  the  question  of  joining.  Citi 
zen  Whitehead  added  that  it  was  necessary  that  some  definite  instructions  should 
be  given  to  Delegates  with  respect  to  contributions  from  Societies. 

A m a l g a m a t ed  Carpenters  a nd  Joiners 

The  Secretary  said  he  had  received  a  Letter from  the  Secretary  from  this  Society  an 
nouncing  their  readiness  to  receive  a  Deputation  from  our  body  on  Tuesday  Eve 
ning  at  8.30.  Jung,  Lessner,  Lafargue  and  Fox  were  appointed  to  attend  on  this  So 
ciety. 

The  question  then  arose,  what  instructions  should  be  given  to  the  Deputation  in 

reference  to  the  terms  upon  which  Societies  should  be  admitted. | 

Carter  alluded  to  the  Rule  adopted  by  the  Geneva  Congress,  which  required 
3d  per  member  for  the  expenses  of  Central  Council.  Carter  contended  that  Affilia 
tion  and  Membership were  two  different  things  and  that  the  Congressional rules  ap 
plied  only  to  the  latter. 

Marx  on  the  authority  of the  minutes  contradicted  Carter  and  said  that  the  Con 
gress  refused  to  recognise  any  affiliation  as  distinct  from  membership.  Shaw  moved 
and  Lassassie  seconded  "That  the  Delegates  to  the  Carpenters  and  Joiners  be  in 
structed  to  ask  for  a  Levy  of  3d  per  member  for  the  exceptional  expenses  of  1866 
and  1867." 

Fox  moved  an  Amendment  and  Marx  seconded  That  the  Delegates  be  instructed 
to  say  that  they will  issue  Cards  of Subscriptions  to  the  said  Society  in  the  following 
proportion,  one  Card  for  every  3d  subscribed. 

Jung  suggested  that  a  minimum  of  Id  per  Head  be  asked  for. 
Carter  argued  that Lawrence  had  said  that  Id  would  be  too  high.  He  would  prefer 

y2d  per  Head. 

The  Amendment  of Fox  was  Carried  on  a  division  by  8  to  6. 
Fox  then  asked  Jung  and  Carter  if they  would  move  their  minimum  proposition 
as  an  amendment to his  proposition  if put  as  a  substantial motion but they  declined 
and it was  agreed  that  the  whole  subject must be  reargued;  that the  present  decision 
was  only  provisional.

Brussels  Letter 

5 

Fox  read  a  Letter  from  Vandenhouten  the  Secretary  of the  Brussels  Section,  com 
plaining  of  the  laches  of  Citizen  Longuet,  who  had  never  informed  the  Brussels 
Section  that  he  had  been  elected  Corresponding  Secretary,  nor  had  he  ever  corre-
sponded  with  them.  The  j|12|  Brüsselers  also  complained  that  they  had  never  been 
informed  of the  date  of the  Congress,  consequently  they  were  unable  to  be  present 
or  to  send  papers.  They  knew  Lafargue  and  in  consequence  were  more  surprised 
than  they  would  otherwise  have  been  at  his  silence. 

Marx  defended  his  conduct  while  Secretary  and  carried  the  war  into  the  Belgian 

10  camp. 

Le  Lubez  spoke  in  defence  and  glorification  of the  Brussels  section  and  contend 
ed  that  they  had  been  shamefully  neglected.  Lafargue  defended  Longuet  and  him 
self.  The  nomination  of  Longuet  was  known  in  Brussels  because  it  had  been  at 
tacked  in  the  Espiègle.  Longuet  had  corresponded  by  means  of announcements  in  La 
15  Rive  Gauche  which  was  received  and  read  by  the  Brussels  Section.  The  date  of 

the  Congress  had  been  given  in  the  address  of the  Association  which  had  been  pub 
lished  in  the  Tribune  du  Peuple.  Longuet  did  not  know  the  address  of  the  Brussels 
men.  Carter  and  Dupont  both  stated  that  they  had  heard  Fontaine  of  Brussels  say 
that  he  was  appointed  delegate  to  the  Congress  at  Geneva  in  this  room.  He  had 
r  20  never  professed  ignorance  of the  date.  Le  Lubez  stated  that  Longuet  knew  the  ad 
dress  of the  Tribune  du  Peuple  which  was  the  organ  of  the  Brussels  Section.  Fox  re 
membered  an  act of laches  on the part of Longuet which had  come to his  knowledge. 
The  resolution  this  council  came  to  in  reference  to  the  apology  due  to  the  Italian 
Delegates  had  never  been  communicated  to  the  Echo  de  Verviers,  the  Consequence 

- 25  was  that  the  Italian  Delegates  had  not  resumed  their  seats  at  our  board.  Jung  de 
clared  that  he  had  given  Longuet  the  address  of the  Brussels  men  and  told  him  to 
forward  the  resolution  to  the  Echo  de  Verviers.  He  proposed  that  a  letter  be  written 
by Lafargue  |jl3|  explaining  the  hitch  of the  past  and  promising  amendment  for the 
future.  Lassassie  seconded  the  motion.

A p p o i n t m e nt  of  C o r r e s p o n d e nt 

Dupont  solicited  the  appointment  of Andrew  Marchet  as  Correspondent  for  Bor­
deaux and the Arrondissement of Lesparre in place of another Correspondent who has 
withdrawn.  Appointment  made  accordingly. 

Dupont  then  stated  the  result  of his  visit  to  Lyons.  How  the  Lyonnais  members 
-  35  were divided in two parties, one desiring to make their section chiefly Political, the 

other  exclusively  Social  in  their  tendencies— 

He  also  visited  Fleurieux-sur-Saône  and  other  places  where  we  had  branches,  many 
of the  members  in  these  parts  were  cultivators  of the  Vine  and  he  was  surprised  to 
find  the  faith  reposed  in  the  association  by  these  men.  He  also  visited  Vienne  and 
found  a  Co-operative  Cloth  Manufacturing  Company  and  Flour  Mill  on  the  Cash 
principle,  and  a  Co-operative  Grocery  and  Bakery.

Dupont  then  read  correspondence  from  Vienne,  asking  for  their  Carnets  or  titles 
of  Membership.  He  also  read  a  report  of the  state  of  industry  in  that  place  espe 
cially  referring  to  the  hard  lot  of the  Factory women  in  that place branches  of indus 
try. 

Jung  on  behalf of Dr  Coullery  asked  if it  would  be  allowed  to  form  a  section  ex 
clusively  of Women.  The  unanimous  Resolution  was,  that  it was  permissable.  Col 
let  a  member  of  the  association,  said  that  he  was  willing  to  insert  reports  of  our 
doings  in  his  paper  "Courrier  International,"  reserving  to  himself the  right  to  com 
ment  upon  them  if he  should  think  proper. 

Dupont  gave  Notice  of  Proposition  to  bring  before  the  Council  in  favor  of  or 
ganising  Workingmen's  Excursions  from  ||14|  Britain  to  the  Paris  Exhibition  of 
1867  under  the  conduct  of the  International  Workingmen's  Association.

The  Vice-President  in  the  Chair. 

The  minutes  of the  previous  meeting  were  read  and  confirmed.  Cremer  demand 
ed  the  right  of making  a  personal  explanation  in  reference  to  the  12s  Id  he  had  re 
ceived  more  than  the  others.  He  reminded  the  Council that  he  and Jung  had  stayed 
longer  in  Switzerland  than  the  others  and  had  had  more  expenses.  The  money  he 
had  received  did  not  cover  his  out-of-Pocket  Expenditure.  He  had  not  demanded 
anything  for  his  time. 

Carter restated  his  grievance.  Jung  offered  to  refund  one  Pound  to  Carter,  suiting 
the  Action  to  the  word  took  out  his  Porte-monnaie,  but  what  passed  subsequently 
in  regard  to  this  escaped  the  Secretary's  Notice. 

Lafargue  stated  that  he  had  replied  to  the  Belgian  Correspondent. 
Jung  stated  that  a  Member  of  the  Association  coming  from  Geneva  to  London 
who  had  been  entrusted  by  Citizens  Dupleix  and  Becker with  four  parcels  of docu 
ments  belonging  to  the  Association  had  been  searched  on  the  French Frontiers  and 
had  the  Four  Parcels  taken  from  him.  He  read  a  letter  from  Giuseppe  Dassi  of Na 
ples  stating  that  he  had  been  appointed  a  Delegate  to  the  Geneva  Congress  by  the 
Workingmen's  Association  of  Cerignola  but  that  he  had  received  his  commission 
too  late  to  avail of it;  at  the  conclusion he  said  that  if the  Council  desired  to  corre 
spond  with  General  Garibaldi  he  would  deliver  ||15|  the  Letter  with  his  own  hands 
and  send  back  the  answer. 

The  Secretary  read  a  letter he  had  from  Mr Applegarth  the  Secretary of the  Amal 
gamated  Carpenters,  thanking  the  Council  for the  Deputation  that  had  been  sent  to 
that  body  for  the  agreeable  and  instructive  entertainment  they  had  afforded  to  their 
audience.  He  also  read  an  extract  from Becker's  opening  speech  at the  Geneva  Con 
gress  as  reported  in  the  Vorbote  and  observed  upon  its  openly  atheistical  Character. 
He  also  read  from  the  Journal  de  Genève  of  Sept  14t h,  a  Conservative  middle  class 
paper,  a  tribute  to  the  truly  Cosmopolitan  spirit  which  pervaded  the  Congress.  He 
also  brought  before  the  Council  a  Subscription  Sheet  for  the  imprisoned  Vesinier.

The  deputation  stated  that  their  trade  was  engaged  in  a  struggle  for  the  early  Clos 
ing  on  Saturday  Afternoons.  Several  Middlesized  Employers  were  bringing  over 
men  from  Paris  to  nil  the  Places  of those  men  who  had  been  called  out  of the  recal 
citrant  Shops.  The  deputation  prayed  the  Council  to  use  its  influence  at  Paris  to 
frustrate  the  evil  designs  of these  Masters. 

Carter,  Marx  and  Lawrence  spoke  in  response  pleading the  Council to use  its  best 

efforts  in  the  direction  mentioned.

Lawrence  stated  that  an  Edinburgh  Master  declared  at  the  late  Master Tailors'  Con 
gress  that  £400  had  been  spent  in  bringing  over  Tailors  from  the  Continent  during 
this  Summer.  Many  of  the  importations  still  remained  behind  in  the  Neighbour 
hood  of the  Scottish  Capital  affecting  the  Labor  market  there.  ||16|  Stewart  another 
master  boasted  on  the  same  occasion  that  he  had  brought  over  a  live  cargo  of Tai 
lors  who  had  hustled  the  guts  out  of the  Newcastle  Strike. 

On  the  Motion  of Jung  the  Gen  Secretary  was  ordered  to  write  to  Dassi,  and  to 

Garibaldi  through  Dassi. 

On  the  Motion  of Marx  the  Gen  Secretary  was  ordered  to  write  to  the  French  Mi 

nistre  de  l'intérieur  complaining  of  the  seizure  of  the  association's  papers  and  re-  20 
questing  that  they  be  restituted. 

Citizen  Dupont  read  a  letter  from  Citizen  Fribourg  of Paris  asking  for  the  min 

utes  of the  Congress  to  enable  them  to  publish  a  report  of the  Congress. 

Marx  protested  against  this  latter  step,  inasmuch  as  the  duty  of publishing  an  ac 

count  of the  Congress  was  devolved  by  that  body  exclusively  on  the  Central  Coun-  25= 
cil.  Further,  the  Parisians  had  kept  their Mémoire  in  violation  of the  Congressional 
order  which  ordained  that  this  and  all  other  documents  should  be  handed  over  to 
the  Central  Council. 

The  General  Secretary  was  ordered  to  write  to  Fribourg  in  this  sense. 

Affiliated  Societies 

30 

Marx  brought  up  a  report  from  the  standing  Committee  to  the  effect  that  Societies 
be  taxed  Id  per  Year  per  Head. 

The  General  Secretary  suggested  that  Jung  should  now  report  the  conversation 
which took  place  on  this  subject with  the  Secretary  of the  Amalgamated  Carpenters' 
Society,  which  was  to  this  effect:  Viz  That  3d  per  head  laid  down  by  Congress  35 
would  cost  their  Society  £93.15.0,  which  they  never  would  pay.  The  compromise 
suggested  by  Fox  and  adopted  by  the  Council  fared  no  better.  Cremer  stated  that

Meeting  of the  General  Council  October 9,  1866 

when the  3d  proposition was  before  the  Congress,  the  British voted  for it  as  a  means 
of extracting  money  from  the  Continentals;  but  with  a  mental  reservation  taken  by 
the  said  Delegates,  not  to  apply  it  at  home  to  associations.  Lawrence  said  the 
scheme  ||17|  of the  standing  committee  would  drive  away  Societies  from  the  Asso 
ciation.  His  Society  even  at  %&  rate  would  have  to  contribute  £14.11.3.  To  carry 
this would  be  a  hazardous  experiment,  the  Country branches  knowing little  or noth 
ing  of the  association.  He  argued  that  there  was  the  London  Trades  Council to  sup 
port;  and  also  the  National  Trades  Alliance.  This  association  should  not  put  the 
screw  on  too  tight.  It  had  better  be  satisfied  with  small  Grants. 

Cremer  had  a  plan  which  he  thought  deserving  of  consideration.  He  moved  the 
adjournment  of  the  Subject,  to  give  him  an  opportunity  of  bringing  it  forward, 
which  was  not  seconded.  Hales  moved  that  the  contribution  be  %d  per  head.  Wes 
ton  spoke  in  favor  of a  fixed  sum  and  in  opposition  to  Lawrence's  idea.  Jung  sec 
onded  Hales'  proposal.  To  carry  out  the  Voluntary  principle  would  cause  an  im 
mense  waste  of time  on  our  part.  Dell  spoke  in  the  same  sense  as  Weston.  Marx 
accepted  Hales's  proposition  but  suggested  that  the  words  "not  less  than"  should  be 
l/2d.  Weston  and  others  objected  to  this  suggestion  of Marx 
inserted  before  the  word 
and  it  was  not  pressed.  Hales's  proposition  of  l/2â  was  then  Carried. 

The  meeting  then  adjourned. 
The  names  of the  members  who  voted  for  the  %â  Levy:  Cremer,  Dell,  Weston,

/ 1 7/ Council Meeting October 16th 

Vice-President  Eccarius  in  the  chair. 

The  minutes  of  the  previous  meeting  were  read  and  confirmed.  The  names  of 
those  who  voted  for  the  resolution  of  October  9th  were  ordered  to  be  appended  to 
the  minutes.  Cits  James  Dutton  and  Whitehead  desired  to  have  their  names  added 
to  the  list  as  approving  of the  resolution  come  to  by  the  Central  Council.  Weston 
moved  and  Jung  seconded,  That  the  Secretary  ||18|  read  over  the  aforesaid  resolu 
tion  for  several  weeks  in  succession  in  order  to  give  an  opportunity  to  as  many 
members  as  possible  to  adhere  thereto.  Carried  Nem  Con. 

The  Secretary  mentioned  Mr  Miall's  application  to  become  his  tenants-in-chief 
instead  of the  Industrial Newspaper  Company.  Nothing  was  done  on  this  point.  He 
also  spoke  about  the  Cards  and  Carnets;  also  of the  necessity  of definitively  consti 
tuting  the  standing  Committee. 

Citizen  J.  Dutton  moved  that  the  Standing  Committee  be  appointed  for  three 

months  from  the  date  of Congress.  Seconded  by  Carter  and  carried  Nem  Con. 

The  following  members  were  added  to  the  standing  Committee  Viz  Carter, 

Whitehead,  and  Lawrence. 

Le  Lubez  asked  leave  to  bring  a personal matter  before  the  Council.  In  the  num 
ber  of  the  Travail  dated  Sept  30  a  Co-operative  paper  published  at  Ghent,  it  was 
stated  in  a  full  report  of the  congress  that  one  member  had  been  excluded  from  the 
Central Council by a Unanimous Vote, having been guilty of calumniating the  Paris 
ian  Delegates.  Le  Lubez  said  that  if his  information  was  correct  the  vote  for his  ex 
clusion was  not  unanimous;  the  London  Delegates  having  spoken  against the  exclu 
sion,  abstained  from  voting.  He  demanded  that  the  Council  should  protect  him 
from  this  misstatement  of the  Travail.  After  Carter,  Eccarius,  Cremer,  and  Jung  had 
stated  what  took  place  on  this  point  at  the  Congress,  Carter  moved  and  Shaw  sec 
onded:  That  the  matter  be  referred  to  the  standing  Committee.  Carried  Nem  Con. 
Weston mentioned the  debt  due  to  Mr Leno  for Printing which was  of long  stand 

ing,  No  action  was  taken  on  this  point. 

Cremer  brought  forward  his  motion  which  had  been  approved  of by  the  standing 
Committee;  it  was,  That  a  Deputation  be  appointed  to  wait  on  the  Trades  Council 
to  solicit  them to  use their influence to get the Trades  Societies  connected  ||19|  with 
them  to  join  this  Association.  Carried  Nem  Con.

Meeting  of the  General  Council  October  16,  1866 

Cremer,  Whitehead,  Jung  and  as  many  other  members  of the  Council  that  could 

attend  were  appointed  as  a  deputation. 

Cremer  reported  that  the  Coachmakers  were  likely  at  their  ensuing  General 

Meeting  to join  the  Association. 

A p p o i n t m e nt  of  Secretary  for  H o l l a nd 

Jung  moved,  That  Jacques  Van  Rijen  be  Corresponding  Secretary  for  Holland.  He 
recited  his  accomplishments.  Dupont  seconded  the  motion,  Carried  Nem  Con. 

Correspondence 

Jung  read  a  letter  from  Switzerland;  asking  for  Rules  and  reports  of the  principal 
Cooperative  Societies  of  Britain.  He  was  referred  to  Henry  Pitman  Editor  of  the 
Cooperator.  Dupont  laid  on  the  Table  Correspondence  from  Bordeaux,  Fleurieux-sur-
Saône,  calling  upon  the  Council  to  provide  Carnets. 

Carter moved  and  Shaw  seconded,  That  Dupont  be  instructed  to  take  this  matter 

in  hand  and  see  to  their  being  furnished.  Carried  Nem  Con. 

Dupont  read  a  Letter  from  Fribourg  of  Paris;  arguing  that  they  had  a  right  to 
print  their  own  Essays  at  their  own  expense.  He  also  desired  Dupont  to  send  over 
Copies  of  the  Constitution  and  the  amendments  as  agreed  to  at  Geneva  as  he 
wanted  them for the  Carnets  they  were  about  to  issue.  The  Chairman  cautioned  the 
Council  from  acceding  to  the  latter  part  of the  Letter  as  the  Parisians  after  issuing 
Carnets  would  never send  us  a sou.  Fox  agreed  with  the  Parisians  as  to  their right  to 
publish  their  own  Essays. 

The  Council  instructed  Dupont to  refuse  Fribourg's  request  as  the  Council  would 

furnish  the  Carnets.

/ 2 0/ Council Meeting October 23rd 

Citizen  James  Dutton  in  the  Chair. 

The  minutes  of the  previous  meeting  were  read  and  confirmed. 
James  Lee  and  Richard  Overton  presented  their  credentials  from  the  United  Ex 
cavators'  Society  as  Delegates  thereof to  this  Council.  They paid  the  entrance  fee of 
5/-  and  stated  that  when  they  had  obtained  their  yearly  returns  they  would  pay  the 
Halfpenny  Levy.  On  the  motion  of Carter  Lee  and  Overton  were  accepted  as  mem 
bers  of the  Council. 

The  Secretary  brought  up  our  relations  with  Mr  Miall  and  it  was  resolved,  That 
we  put  ourselves  in  the  place  of  the  Industrial  Newspaper  Company  on  the  terms 
proposed  by  Mr  Miall. 

The  Secretary  mentioned  the  fact  that  in  the  Syllabus  of the  Lectures  of the Work 
ingmen's  College  the  President  was  delivering  a  course  on  the  History  of  Europe 
in the  16th  Century.  He  then read  aloud  the  %d  Levy  Resolution  and  it was  acceded 
to  by  Mr Williams.  He  gave  the  address  of the  Hatters'  Society  to  Mr Williams  who 
undertook  to  see  the  Secretary  and  sound  him  on  the  Subject  of  a  deputation.  He 
also  read  an  extract  from  an  American  Journal  stating  that  some  French  men,  Hun 
garians,  and  Poles  in  the  United  States  had  sent  a  joint  deputation  to  James  Ste 
phens  and  were  collecting  subscriptions  for  the  Irish  Republican  Cause, 

Buckley  spoke  of the  want  of a  Minute  Book.  The  Secretary  stated  that  if permit 
ted  he  would  purchase  one  out  of  the  money  he  had  in  hand.  No  objection  was 
made  to  this. | 

]21|  T he  Le  Lubez  affair  and  the  Travail 

The  Secretary  brought  up  the  report  of the  Standing  Committee  on this  affair.  They 
found  that  the  minutes  of  the  Congress  stated  that  the  ostracising  resolution  was 
passed  unanimously:  on  enquiring  whether  the  minutes  were  correct  in  so  stating,: 
Jung  the  Chairman  stated  that  he  put  the  „Contre"  and  that  no  hands  were  held  up 
in  response;  that  as  to  abstentions  from  voting  he  had  declared  at  the  Commence 
ment  of the  Congress  that  no  notice  could  be  taken  of these  unless  a  demand  wass 

496 

Meeting  of the  General  Council  October  23,  1866 

made  that such  abstentions  be  inserted  in  the  minutes.  No  such  demand  was  made 
by  anybody  as  the  minutes  showed.  Citizen  Carter  had  also  given  evidence  before 
the  Committee  and  had  stated  that  the  London  Delegates  purposely  and  delib 
erately  abstained  from  voting  because  they  knew  they  were  to  be  outvoted  prodig 
iously.  The  standing  Committee  therefore  concluded  that  the  report  in  the  „Tra-
vail"  was  literally  correct.  There  were  indeed  the  speeches  of  Odger  and  Cremer 
which  were  in  favor  of Le  Lubez  which  were  recorded  in  the  minutes.  Those  del 
egates  might  do  as  they  liked  in  the  matter but  they  could  under  the  circumstances 
do  nothing.  Carter  gave  the  reasons  of the  London  delegates  not  voting. 

Marx  and  Jung  spoke.  Weston  thought  the  London  Delegates  did  wrong  in  ab 
staining from voting.  He  agreed  in  the  conclusion  come  to  by  the  standing  commit 
tee.  Dell  thought  the  resolution  of  Ostracism  against  Le  Lubez  gave  evidence  of 
great  narrowness  of mind.  He  believed  Le  Lubez  to  be  a  thorough  Republican  and 
he  hoped  that  the  members  would  sign  an  address  expressive  of their  sympathy  for 
him.  The  report  of the  Standing  Committee  was  accepted  nem  con.  | 

\22\  Carnets  a nd  C o n t i n e n t al  Secretaries 

The  Secretary  stated  that  Citizen  Dupont  had  arranged  to  get  the  Carnets  executed. 
Jung  said  a  Secretary  for  Italy  was  wanted  and  proposed  Carter for  that  office.  Car 
ried  Nem  Con.  The  extraordinary  power  of nominating  a  Secretary  for  Belgium  was 
conferred  upon  Dupont. 

R e p o rt  from  the  L o n d on  Trades  Council 

Jung,  Cremer,  Whitehead  and  Carter waited  on  this  body  at  its  last meeting  and  the 
result  would  appear  in  the  periodical  reports  of the  Council  and  would  be  laid  be 
fore  a  general  Delegate  meeting  on  November 2 8t h.  Jung  said  that  a  member of the 
Trades  Council objected  to  being  affiliated  with  an unskilled  body  like  the  Excava 
tors.  Citizen  Collet  attended  on  behalf  of  the  "National  Reform  League"  of  Den 
mark  Street,  Soho;  on  the  motion  of  himself  and  Mr  Harris  it  had  been  decided 
that  that  body  should  consider  the  propriety  of  joining.  The  discussion  would  come 
on  next  Sunday  after  8  O'clock.  He  desired  the  presence  of  a  deputation.  Jung, 
Weston,  Carter  and  Fox  were  appointed  as  the  deputation. 

Exhibition  of  1867 

Dupont brought  up  from  the  standing  Committee  his  proposal  for  the  association  to 
take  in hand  the  business  of providing  by means  of their correspondents  in  Paris  for 
the  travelling,  boarding  and  lodging  at  a  fixed  tariff  [of]  British  Workingmen  and 
others  desiring  to  visit  the  said  Exhibition.  He  had  opened  these  proposals  to  the 
Parisian  Delegates  at  the  Congress  and  they  were  ready  to  cooperate  heartily  with 

497 

Minutes  of  the  General  Council  of the  I.W.M.A. 

the  Council.  The  Standing  Committee  recommended,  that  a  special  committee  be 
appointed  for  carrying  out  this  plan  and  had  appointed  himself,  Cremer,  White 
head,  Lucraft,  Carter  and  Lessner.  The  report  and  appointment  of  the  Standing 
Committee  were  adopted. | 

|23|  Carter  proposed  that  the  question  of helping Workingmen  who  desired  to  be 
come  exhibitors  be  referred  to  the  Special  Committee.  Dupont  seconded  and,  it was 
Carried  Nem  Con. 

T he  Edenbridge  R i ot  between  English  a nd  Belgian  Navvies 

On  the  interpellation  of  Citizen  Weston,  Citizen  James  Lee  the  Secretary  of  the 
United  Excavators'  Society  made  the  following  statement.  He  had  made  enquiries 
on  the  spot  concerning  the  origin  of  the  "difficulty"  between  the  Belgian  and  the 
English  navvies,  and  he  found  that  it  did  not  arise  from  a jealousy  of the  Continen 
tal labourers  as  such.  The  Messrs.  Waring,  who had brought the  Belgians  over,  gave 
notice  to  the  English  navvies  to  quit  the  huts  in  which  they  were  living,  and  which 
they  had  built.  Now,  as  the  English  held  that  their  huts  were  castles,  they  became 
irate  and  assaulted  the  Belgians.  The  quarrel was  not one  of wages  or nationality,  as 
had  been  represented,  but  one  of house  and  home.  Mr  Lee  further  stated  that  he 
had  conversed  through  an  interpreter  with  the  Belgians  who  considered  that  they 
had  been  completely  "gulled"  by  Messrs.  Waring's  agents  who  had  represented  that 
they  would  receive  from  four  to  six  francs  a  day,  whereas  they  only  receive  three 
francs  a  day  for  which  they  must  fill  18  waggons  a  day  instead  of  15,  which  is  the 
average  amount.  Messrs  Waring  are  demanding  from  these  poor  Belgians  more 
than  any  other  contractors  in the  Kingdom  are  demanding  from  the  native  navvies. 
The  consequence  of this  has  been  that  many  of the  Belgians  have  found  that  they 
could  stand  neither  the  climate  nor  the  work  and  have  returned.  The  others  would 
return  if they  had  their  passage  money. I 

)24)  The  United  Excavators'  society,  being  above  national  prejudices,  is  not  only 
willing  but  desirous  to  enroll  the  remaining  Belgian  navvies  among  its  own  ranks, 
and  the  Belgians  seem  well  disposed  to  accept  the  proposals  made  to  them  by  the 
agents  of the  said  society. 

The  Meeting  then  adjourned. /

which  meets  at  the  Bell  Inn,  Old  Bailey  was  now  heard.

He  stated  that  the  masters  were  threatening  to  import  Belgian  workmen.  He 
asked  the  Council  to  use  its  influence  to  circumvent  this  dodge.  He  declared  that 
he  was  empowered  to  affiliate  his  Society  to  a  new  Association.  The  Belgian  and 
Hollandish  Sees,  were  instructed  to  communicate  with  their  respective  countries. 

Mr  Brighting  stated  that  the  master  who  was  engaged  in  hiring  the  Belgians  was 
i5  Frederick  George  Packer  of  New  Cross.  On  motion  of  Shaw  and  Whitehead  Cit. 
Brighting  after  having  signed  the  application  for  admission  was  elected  a  member

G as  f i t t i n g s. 

a  The  Sec.  mentioned  the  matter  of the  gas  fittings  and  bell  work.  Mr. Miall  wished

Í0 
amount,  viz.  16s.  per  annum.

He  said  that  Carter,  Weston,  Dupont,  and  himself had  attended  the  National  Re 
form  League  which  met  at  the  Eclectic  Institute  Denmark  Street,  Soho,  on  Sunday 
last.  He  stated  what  passed.  He  was  questioned  by  the  members  as  to  the  terms  of 
admission  and  reserved  the  subject for the  consonance  of the  General  Council.  The 
point was,  could  a political party  like  the National Reform League be  allowed  to  en 
ter  on  the  same  terms  as  the  Trade  Societies? 

Shaw,  Dupont,  Carter,  Whitehead,  Hales,  Dell  and  Weston  delivered  their  opin 
ions  on  this  question  and  it  was  ultimately  referred  to  the  Standing  Committee  to 
report  to  the  next  meeting. 

Lyons  c h ô m a g e. 

Dupont  read  the  letter  of Fribourg,  inviting  the  General  Council  to  solicit  general 
subscriptions  throughout  Europe  for  the  Lyons'  sufferers  but  as  the  attendance was 
so  small,  he  would  adjourn  the  matter  until  next  week. 

Hales  spoke  of the  feeling  of the  men  of Coventry  in  reference  to  the  French  rib 

bon  and  lace  trade  and  also  of the  state  of  trade  at  Coventry.

beginning  to  practise  the  principle  of Cooperation  ought  to  receive  publicity.  He  re

Sec.  promised  to  do  so. 

T he  N a t i o n al  Reform  League. 

The  Sec.  brought up  the  report  of the  Standing  Committee.  They  recommended  the 
N. R. L.  be  admitted  on  the  same  terms  as  those  offered  to  Trade  Societies. 

Shaw  and  Odger  supported  the  report  of the  Committee. 
Hales  moved  that  it was  inexpedient  to  adopt  the report  of the  Standing  Commit 
tee,  but  after  explanation  of some  of the  members  thereof,  Hales  withdrew  his  op 
position  and  the  report  of the  Committee  was  unanimously  adopted. ] 

|28|  The  Sec.  then  brought  up  the  following  recommendation  of  the  Standing 
Committee,  "That  no  member  at  the  Central  Council  meetings  be  allowed  to  speak 
more  than  5  minutes." 

Odger  objected  to  this  and  on  motion  of Hales  it  was  unanimously  rejected. 
The  Sec.  then  brought  up  the  following  resolution  from  the  Standing  Committee, 
1. "That  any member  of the  Central  Council  who  shall  be  absent  for  more  than  4 
sittings  from  Council  meetings  without  giving  satisfactory  reasons  therefor  shall  be 
liable  to  have  his  name  erased  from  the  list  of the  Council." 

2.  "This  resolution  to  be  immediately  communicated  to  every  member  of  the 

Council." 

A  lively  discussion  sprang  up  on  this  resolution.  Carter,  Lessner,  Hales  and  Jung 
being  in  favour  of it  and  Eccarius,  Fox  and  Weston  against  it.  Weston  thought  that 
at  least  so  important  a resolution should  not be  carried  in  so  thin  a meeting  and  un 
til  notice  had  been  given  in  the  Commonwealth.  He  moved  that  the  debate  be  ad-^ 
journed  until  next  week;  Lessner  seconded  this  and  the  adjournment  was  carried 
unanimously. 

The  Council  then  adjourned.  |

President  Odger  in  the  chair. 

The  minutes  of the  previous  meeting  were  read  and  confirmed. 
The  General  Secretary  read  a  letter  from  Cit.  Le  Lubez  in  reference  to  the  action 
5  he  contemplated  taking  in  vindication  of himself against  the  stigma  put  upon  him 

by  the  Congress  of Geneva. 

In  the  course  of the  discussion  that  accused  [him]  the  Chairman  stated  that  he 

held  up  his  hand  against  the  resolution  ostracising  Le  Lubez. 

On  Jung  denying  this  fact  Odger  again  vouched  for  it  and  added  that  he  was 

10 

sneered  at  for  his  singularity. 

Cremer,  Carter,  Jung,  Hales,  Fox,  and  Weston  took  part  in  the  discussion  and 
eventually  the  motion  of Hales  was  carried  unanimously  that  the  General  Secretary 
answer  Le  Lubez's  letter  in  the  sense  that  the  General  Council  can  do  nothing  in­
consistent  with  the  resolution  of the  Congress  at  whose  hands  it  holds  its  own  ap-

15  pointment. 

Jung  made  a  communication  in  reference  [to]  what  was  doing  at  Chaux  de 

Fonds. 

Cit.  Brighting,  the  delegate  of the  Basket  Makers'  Society,  stated  that  12  Belgian 
Basket makers  had  been  brought  over by  the  agent  of the  Masters'  Joint  Stock  Corn­
eo  pany,  that  six  of  these  were  at  work  at  the  Company's  shops  under  the  railway 
arches  in  Blue  Anchor Lane,  Bermondsey.  The  trade  in  London  consisted  of about 
400  men,  taking  Society  and  non-Society  men  together.  The  masters  decided  to  | 
|30|  break  down  the  Basket  Makers'  Society  by  importing  Continentals  to  take  the 
place  of  the  Society  men.  The  six  Belgians  could  not  be  got  as  he  believed  they 
slept on  the  premises.  He  requested  the  aid  of the  Council in  communicating  with 
these men.

(At  this  stage  of the  proceedings,  Odger  left  the  chair  and  the  room  to  attend  an­

other  engagement  and  Shaw  was  voted  into  the  Chair). 

Dupont  stated  that  Cit.  Derkinderen  was  a  Fleming  and  would  be  at  the  service 

3P  of the  Basket  makers. 
Τ 

Shaw  and  Cremer  advised  that  no  time  be  lost,  and  Cremer  suggested  a  ruse.  It 
was  finally  determined  that  Fox  and  Derkinderen  should  meet  Cit.  Brighting  at  the

the  enlightenment  of the  deluded  and  the  enfranchisement  of the  imprisoned  Bel 
gians. 

Lessner  laid  on  the  table  a  copy  of  the  New  Yorker  Democrat,  a  New  York  Daily 
paper  in  the  German  language,  containing  an  account  of the  Geneva  Congress  by 
its  own  Special  Correspondent  at  Geneva. 

Report  of  deputation 

Jung  gave  an  account  of his  visit  to  the  Eleastic  Web  Weavers  on  Monday  last.  He 
was  alone.  He  was  well  received  and  he  believed  that  the  brother  Societies  of this 
trade  at  Leicester,  Derby  and  Manchester would  follow  the  London  Society  in join 
ing.  Cit.  Hales  on  behalf  of the  Elastic  Web  Weavers  of London,  numbering  only 
50  men,  put  down  10s.  and  received  a  large  card. | 

|31|  On motion  of Fox,  David  Dry was  accepted  as  the  Web  Weavers'  delegate  to 

this  council. 

Cit  Collet  implored  the  council  to  lend  a  hand  to  the  Bakers. 
Lessner  moved  and  Hales  seconded  that  Cit.  Massman,  who  was  about  to  take 
ship  for  Germany  be  authorised  to  act  for  this  Association  in  Germany.  Carried 
unanimously. 

Cremer  stated  that  he  was  going  on  his  Lecturing  tour  and  asked  leave  to  take 

300  copies  of the  Association's  Address  with  him. 

granted 

unanimously. 

Leave 
Cit.  Hales  gave  notice  of motion  as  to  the  desirability  of establishing  Branches  of 
the Association  on the  same  plan  as  the  Reform  League.  Shaw interpellated  Cremer 
about  the  Balance  sheet  and  received  permission  to  obtain  it  from  Mrs. Cremer.

Carter  stated  that  the  committee  had  met  and  had  appointed  Fox  as  its  Secretary. 
The  Committee  desired  Fox  to  write  to  the  several  Railway  Companies  and  to 
Mr.  Cook  and  to  the  Universal  Tourist  Co.  to  ascertain  the  fares  that  would  be 
charged  for  return  tickets  for  a  week  and  a  fortnight  first  and  second  class. 

Fox  undertook  the  office.

Vice-President  Eccarius  took  the  chair  and  read  a  letter  from  Secretary  Fox  which 
stated  that  he  would  not  be  present. 

The  minutes  of the  last  meeting  were  read,  when  Cit  Jung  said  that  it  was  very 
important that the  statement made  by  Cit.  Cremer at the  last meeting  should  be  en 
tered  on  the  minutes—Viz,—That  he,  Cremer  never  saw  Odger  hold  up  his  hand 
against  the  motion  that  debarred  Le  Lubez  from  sitting  on  the  Council.  It  was 
agreed  that  the  statement  should  be  entered. 

The  minutes  were  then  confirmed. 
Cit  Dry  took  his  seat  as  Delegate  from  the  Elastic  Web  Weavers. 

C o r r e s p o n d e n ce 

Cit Jung  said:  The  Belgians wished to  know how the  "Trades  Societies"  were  admit 
ted,  whether  members  pay  an  individual  Subscription  or  a  certain  amount  for  the 
whole  of  the  Society  and  what  rights  had  the  members  of  Trades  Societies  when 
their  Societies  had  joined.  He  also  informed  the  Council  that  Brismée  could  not 
give  an  estimate  for  printing  the  General  Report  of the  Congress  until  he  knew  the 
size  of the  pages  and  the  kind  of Type. 

Basket  M a k e rs 

Cit  Derkinderen stated  that  he  in  conjunction  with Fox  and  a  member  of the  Basket 
Makers'  Society  went  to  Blue  Anchor  Lane  on  last  Wednesday  for  the  purpose  of 
drawing  the  Belgian  Basket  Makers  out  of  the  shops,  after  providing  themselves 
with  a  French  and  a  Flemish  Letter  Fox  and  Derkinderen  went  to  the  Shops,  they 
saw  the  Master,  and  Fox  asked  him  if he  ||33|  could  employ  Derkinderen's  Brother 
who was  represented  to  be  a  Basket Maker  and was  at present in  Belgium.  The  mas 
ter  said  he  would  employ  the  brother.  He  invited  Fox  and  Derkinderen  into  the 
workshops  and  whilst  Fox was  entertaining  the  master  in  conversation  Derkinderen 

505 

Minutes  of the  General  Council  of the  I.W.M.A. 

was  pointing  out  to  the  Belgians  the  injury  they  were  inflicting  on  the  English  Bas 
ket  Makers  and  he  succeeded  in  getting  two  of  them  to  come  out  of  the  Shop  to 
have  a  glass  of drink,  although  the  master  objected  very  much.  The  two  Belgians  at 
their  interview  with  the  English Basket  Maker were  so  impressed  of the  wrong  that 
they  were  doing  to  the  English  that  they  resolved  to  go  back  to  the  shop,  pack  up 
their  tools  and  persuade  the  other  four  men  to  come  out.  They  did  not  succeed  in 
bringing  the  four  men  out that  day.  They went to  the  Basket  Makers'  Society  House 
at  the  "Bell,"  Old  Bailey.  They  were  well  received  and  provided  with  a  bed  and 
everything  they  could  require  by  the  Basket  Makers.  On  the  next  day  they  went 
back  to  the  shops  and  induced  the  other  four  men  to  come  out.  The  Basket  Makers 
paid  the  passage  money  for  the  six  men  to  Belgium  and  supplied  them  with  money 
as  well.  They  saw  them  on  board  ship  bound  for  home  and just  as  the  Vessel  was 
starting  the  Master  Basket  Makers  made  their  appearance  and  tried  to  induce  the 
men  to  return,  but  they  failed,  and  the  men  sailed  away  determined  to  prevent  any 
more  Belgians  coming  over here under the  same  circumstances.  The  Basket  Makers 
had  heard  that  some  more  Belgians  were  coming.  ||34|  They  were  on  the  look  out, 
They  saw  a  Vessel  arrive  with two  Belgians  aboard,  each had  a pattern Basket.  Der-
kinderen  spoke  to  them  and  explained  the  state  of affairs,  took  them  to  a  Flemish 
Hotel  where  they  were  kept  until  Sunday  and  then  sent  home  by  the  Basket-Mak* 
ers'  Society.  Derkinderen  also said that seven Dutch-men arrived on Friday last, the • 
Masters  met them  at  Gravesend  and  brought  them  to  Bermondsey by  Rail.  A  Letter 
was  sent  into  the  shops  to  the  Dutchmen  but  none  of them  could  read,  so  the  Mas 
ter  had  the  letter  given  to  him  to  read,  consequently  its  object  was  frustrated.  Der 
kinderen  went  to  the  shops  on  the  Saturday  afternoon,  saw  the  Master  bring  the. 
Dutchmen  out  and  take  them  to  several  Coffee  Houses  to  obtain  Lodgings.  Derkin* 
deren  tried  to  persuade  the  Dutchmen  to  leave  the  Master but  did  not  succeed.  The 
Master took  the  men  to  his  private  House  to  sleep,  and  the  Basket  makers  consider 
that  the  Dutchmen  will  do  the  Masters  more  harm  than  good,  so  they  have  decided 
to  let  them  stop  where  they  are.  Derkinderen  said  that  the  Basket  Makers  had  well 
satisfied  him  for  his  trouble. 

On  the  motion  [of]  Cit.  Jung  seconded  by  Cit.  Marx  a vote  of thanks  was  awarded: 

to  Cit.  Derkinderen  for  his  zealous  and  intelligent  services—carried. 

On  motion  of Cit  Marx  seconded  by  Cit  Jung  the  Secretary  was  directed  to  write 
to  Cit.  Collet remonstrating with him  on  account  of his  neglect  in  printing  the  Car-
nets. 

On  the  Resolution  from  the  Standing  Committee  ||35|  being  read  with  regard  to; 

Absentees  the  following  Amendment  was  carried, 

"That  a  Book  be provided  for  the  Members  of the  Council  to  sign  their names in  ; 
the  said  Book  to  be  presented  to  Congress  for  inspection;  and,  if any  Delegate  from: 
a  Society  should  be  absent more  than  four Nights  without  assigning  a  reason  for so: 
doing,  the  Secretary  shall write  to  the  Society  he  represents  and  inform  them of the: 
• 
Neglect." 

Cit.  Hales'  proposition  for  establishing  Branches  of  the  Association  fell  to  the 
? 

ground  as  being  impracticable  at  the  present  time. 

Cit.  Jung  reminded  the  Council,  that  a  Deputation  must  wait  upon  the  Trades

It was proposed by Cit.  Marx,  and  seconded by  Cit.  Jung,  That the Anniversary of

|36|  Nov'r.  27. 

Citizen  Jung  was  appointed  Chairman. 

The  minutes  of the  previous  meeting  were  read  and  confirmed.  The  General  Sec 
retary  began  by  stating  that  he  observed  an  omission  in  the  narrative  of  Derkin 
deren  à  propos  of  the  Basket  Makers'  affair,  as  rendered  by  temporary  Secretary 
Shaw.  The  omission  was  that  the  promise  had  been  given  by  the  representatives  of 
the  London  Basket  Makers  to  the  Flemings  and  to  Derkinderen  and  himself,  as  rep 
resenting  the  General  Council,  and  that  Derkinderen  and  himself  had,  in  their 
turn,  passed  ||37|  their  word  to  the  Flemings  that  the  General  Council  would  see to 
the  execution  of this  promise,  which  was,  that when  the  dispute  was  over  and  trade 
was  good,  information  of the  fact  should  be  sent  over  to  the  returned  Flemings  and 
that  the  Basket  Makers'  Trade  Society  would  do  its  utmost  to  procure  them  work 
from  the  moment  of their  landing  and  adopt  them  as  members  of  their  Society. 

Citizen  Dupont  said  that  Derkinderen  had  stated  as  much  to  the  General  Coun 

cil. 

The  Council  thereupon  resolved  that  record  of this  promise  and  guarantee  of the 

same  should  be  set  down  in  the  minutes. 

The  General  Secretary  then  laid  upon  the  table  a  copy  of the  private  Prospectus 
issued  by  the  Master  Basket  makers  for  the  purpose  of starting  a joint  stock  Com-» 
pany,  whose  object  it  would  be  to  break  down  the  Trade  Societies  of the  men. 

He  also  laid  upon  the  table  a  copy  of the  Travailleur  associé  of Ghent  and-gave  a 

summary  of its  contents. 

He  further  laid  upon  the  table  an  account  from  the  Proprietors  of the  "Common- : 

wealth"  for  39  insertions  of  the  Association's  advertisement  therein  down  to  No 
vember  24. 

He  also  read  a  letter  from  F. Hakowski,  the  Secretary  of the  recently-formed  So- " 

ciety  of Polish workingmen  in  London,  which  informed  the  Council  of the  organisa 
tion  and  constitution  of that  Society  and  enclosed  copies  of their rules  in  the  Polish; 
ί 
language. 

The  Secretary  was  directed  to  respond  to  this  letter. | 
(38|  The  Secretary  then  stated  that he,  Marx  and  Eccarius  had  been  invited to at­
tend  the  Polish  Celebration  of  the  Anniversary  of Nov'r.  29,  1830,  and  that  he  in­
tended  certainly  to  attend.  Marx  also  declared  that  he  should  attend. 

{ 

508 

Meeting  of the  General  Council  November  27,  1866 

He  then gave  the  reason why  the  lady,  who  had  promised  to  translate  the  account 
of the  Congress  of Geneva  as  given  in  the  Vorbote  for the  Commonwealth  had  not yet 
completed  and  forwarded  her  work  and  further  stated  the  concessions  he  had  made 
to  her  religious  scruples  in  the  matter  of the  translation. 

In  his  capacity  of American  Secretary,  he  desired  the  Secretaries  for  Germany 
and  France  to  procure  certain  information  for him  in  reference  to  the  scale  of post 
age  on  letters  to  the  United  Stated  from  France  and  Northern  Germany  respec 
tively. 

Resignation  of  Secretaryship. 

Fox  then  stated,  with  regret,  that  circumstances  compelled  him  to  tender  his  resig 
nation  of  the  office  of  General  Secretary  to  the  Association.  He  was  about  to  en 
gage  actively  in  a  commercial  pursuit  which  would  specially  occupy  his  evenings 
and  nights  during  the  winter  season,  and  to  give  up  an  evening  would  therefore  be 
to give up  a  day.  He  desired  that his  resignation  should  take  effect  as  from  and  after 
Dec'r.  1.  He  would  then  have  served  the Association  as  interim  and  regular General 
Secretary  for  the  space  of three  calendar  months. 

Jung  and  Marx  thought  the  notice  given  by  Fox  was  not  long  enough  and  Fox 
agreed  to  hold  on  to  the  office  until  Tuesday,  the  4th  December,  but  could  not  un 
dertake  to  be  present  at  the  Council's  sitting  on  that  evening. [ 

|39|  Jung  stated  that he  had  received  a  remittance  from  Cit  Dupleix  amounting  to 
£4  as  a  first  instalment  towards  the  publication  as  ordered  by  the  Congress,  of its 
transactions.  Dupleix's  letter  stated  that  an  appeal had  been  made  to  the  Swiss  sec 
tions and that,  when the fruits  of this  appeal had matured, he would send more mon 
ey.  He,  Dupleix,  was  surprised  that  money  could  not  be  procured  in  England  to 
suffice  for  this  purpose.  He  implored  the  Council  to  hasten  the  printing  of  the 
Transactions  of the  Congress  as  they  were  being  called  for  on  all  sides.  The  delay 
was  operating  very  prejudicially  to  the  Association. 

Jung  further  stated  that  three  packages  of newspapers  had  been  sent  from  Geneva 
addressed  severally  to  himself,  Marx  and  Lessner  and  neither  packet  had  come  to 
hand.  They  had  been  sent  through  Prussia  in  order  to  avoid  the  clutches  of Buona 
parte.  The  precaution  had  been  futile,  for  the  Hohenzollern  was  at  least  as  inquisi 
torial  as  the  Buonaparte.  In  a  word,  their  communication  with  Geneva by  means  of 
newspapers  was  intercepted  as  both  the  German  and  French  routes  were  blocked 
up. 

Jung  further  mentioned  the  case  of  a  manufacturer  of  St.  Imier  who  had  ab 
sconded when largely  in debt to his work people.  The  ouvriers  of St.  Imier requested 
that  a universal,  cosmopolitan  hue  and  cry  should  be  raised  against this  scoundrel, 
so  that  on  this  wide  earth  there  should  be  no  foot  of ground  that  would  not  parch 
the  soles  of his  feet. 

The  Council  were  of opinion  that  they  could  not  take  action  in  this  melancholy 

affair. 

Jung  added  to  his  first  statement  that  Becker  ||40|  had  sent  the  August  number  of 

5 09 

Minutes  of the  General  Council  of the  I.W.M.A. 

the  Vorbote  three  times,  twice  through  France  and  once  through  Prussia,  addressed 
to  him  (Jung)  and  all  three  times  it  had  been  intercepted. 

Cit.  Zabicki  suggested  that  the  fault  lay  in  not  paying  sufficient  postage,  the 
route  through  Germany  being  more  expensive  than  that  through  France.  In  this 
case,  the  newspapers  would  be  lying  at  the  Genevese  or  some  other  Continental 
post  office. 

Jung  also  reported  the  formation  of another  branch  in  the  vicinity  of Chaux-de-

Fonds. 

Fox  asked  Dupont  if he  had  received  any  letters  from  France  lately.  Dupont  re 
plied  that  all  his  lines  of  communication  had  been  suddenly  cut.  He  had  not  re 
ceived  a  single  letter. 

Fox then proceeded to  say that the French Government had,  since  the  close  of the 
Geneva  Congress,  departed  from  its  policy  of neutrality  towards  them  and  was  levy 
ing  war upon  them.  The  French  Government  had  allowed  us  two  years'  growth  and 
we  were  now  able  to  defy  the  Continental blockade  which  the  French  and  the  Prus^ 
sian  Governments  had  declared  against  us.  We  could  no  longer  trust  the  French 
and  Prussian  Post  Offices;  we  must  seek  indirect  and  secret  means  of communica 
tion  with  our  Continental  friends. 

Marx  said  that  we  must  force  Buonaparte  to  declare  himself,  in  order  that  any 
credit  he  may  have  gained  for  his  liberality  in  letting  us  flourish unmolested  might 
be  lost  to  him. 

Carter  suggested  that we  had  better  await the  result  of the  Secretary's  application 
to  Lord  Stanley  in  reference  to  the  papers  seized  on  Jules  Gottraux  before  bringing 
the  matter  before  the  public  and  the  good  sense  of  this  ||41|  immediateley  com" 
mended  itself  to  all  and  the  policy  of  "Wait-a-little  longer"  received  unanimous 
adhesion. 

T he  H a t t e r s'  Society. 

Fox  regretted  the  delay  that  had  taken  place  in  reference  to  our  deputation  to  this 
important  body.  Odger  had  told  him  that  the  Hatters  met  at  the  "Marquis  of 
Granby"  public  house  in  the  Boro',  but  he  (Fox)  had  forgotten  the  name  of  the 
Street.  He  begged  the  Council  to  get  the  address  and  push  the  matter  forward. 

The  Council  then  adjourned./

Vice-President  Eccarius  took  the  chair. 

The  minutes  of the  previous  meeting  were  read  and  confirmed.  Jung  stated  that 

the  Standing  Committee  requested  Shaw  to  accept  the  post  of minute-taker. 

Shaw said  that  it was  highly probable  that he  should  have  to  leave  London to  find 

work,  but  hé  did  not  decline  the  office  pressed  upon  him. 

Fox  who  acted  as  Secretary  for  the  evening  then  read  a  letter from  Lord  Stanley, 
dated  Nov'r.  29,  informing  him  (Fox)  that  he  (Lord  Stanley)  had  requested  Lord 
Cowley  to  inquire  into  the  case  of Jules  Gottraux  and  the  papers  taken from  him. 

Application  for  rent. 

Fox  further  stated  that  Mr.  Arthur  Miall  had  applied  for  the  quarter's  rent  due  last 
Michaelmas. 

The  Council  ordered  the  consideration  of  this  matter  to  be  postponed  as  there 

were  so  few  members  present. 

Basket  M a k e rs  a nd  the  Belgians. 

Fox  recommended  that  Derkinderen  should  obtain  from  the  leading  Basket  makers 
a written  confirmation  of the  promises  ||42|  they  made  to  the  imported  Flemings  in 
the  presence  of  himself  and  Derkinderen.  The  General  Council  were  the  natural 
guarantors  of this  promise.

in  reference  to  the  address  of the  Hatters'  Society  Lee  promised  to  obtain  it  and 

transmit  it  to  the  General  Council.

Minutes of the  General  Council  of the  I.W.M.A. 

T he  Polish  celebration  of  Nov'r.  29. 

Fox  stated  that  himself and  Eccarius  had  been  present  as  invited  guests  at  the  din 
ner given  by  the  Poles  at  Grzeszkowski's  Hotel  de  Pologne,  1  Nassau  St.,  Soho.  Ill 
ness  had  prevented  Marx  from  attending. 

He  then  laid  down  his  office  of General  Secretary. 

T he  U n i t ed  Excavators'  soirée. 

Jung  and  Carter  gave  in  their  report  of their  evening's  doings  on  the  29th.  They  had 
attended  by  invitation  the  above  soirée  at  the  Temperance  Hall,  Cherry  Garden 
Street  with  two  friends  and  had  had  a  pleasant  time  of it.  Carter  took  a  note  of the 
blooming  beauty  of the  young  women  of the  Excavators'  families. 

Swiss  news. 

Jung  had  heard  from  Dupleix  during  the  week,  the  letter  and  the  November  "Vor-
botes"  having  arrived  as  merchandise  in  a box for which he had to  pay  6s.  lOd.  The 
Lyonnese  had  informed  Dupleix  that  no  letters  had  been  received  by  them  from 
Dupont  which  default  they  attributed  to  the  French  Post  Office  authorities.  The 
Lyonnese  were  quite  opposed  to  the  Parisian proposal to  raise  a  subscription  for the 
unwillingly  idle  workmen.  The  money  would  only  get  into  the  hands  of the  Buona-
partists.  Many  hundreds,  however,  were  anxious  to  emigrate  to  America  and  com 
mence  the  manufacture  of  silk  there. 

Jung  here  requested  Fox,  as  Secretary  for  the  United  States  to  make  a  note  of 
this  and  Fox  said  he  knew  a  good  channel  for  publishing  this  fact  in  the  United 
States. I 

[431  Jung  continued.  A letter  from  Becker in  the  same  box  announced  the  forma 
tion  of  numerous  branches  in  Germany.  Becker  had  also  received  a  letter  from  a 
Genoese  member of our Association,  which  stated  that  the  annual  Congress  of Ital 
ian  workingmen's  Associations  was  to  have  been  held  at  Palermo,  but  the  disturb 
ances  of which  that  city  had  been  the  theatre,  forbade  the  execution  of that  design. 
The  said  Congress  would  probably  assemble  at  Venice  before  the  close  of this  year 
and  one  of the  chief subjects  for  discussion  would  be  the  expediency  of adhering  to 
this  Association. 

F r om  the  Standing  C o m m i t t e e. 

Jung  said  that  the  Standing  Committee  had  met  on  the  previous  Saturday. 

Orsini  had  returned  from  the  United  States  and  had  made  a  statement  thereat. 
Orsini had  had  interviews  with  Wendell  Phillips,  Charles  Sumner  and  Horace  Gree-

512 

Meeting  of the  General  Council  December 4,  1866 

ley who had  all joined  our Association.  Wendell Phillips  said he  could  give  the  pro 
ceeds  of  one  of  his  lectures  to  the  Association,  when  he  was  authoritatively  in 
formed  of  the  purposes  to  which  the  money  would  be  put.  Orsini  had  no  doubt 
some  3,000  to  4,000  francs  could  at  once  and  easily  be  procured  from  the  United 
States.  James  Stephens,  the  Irish  Republican  leader,  had joined  our Association. 

The  Standing  Committee  proposed  that  new  Credentials  should  be  issued  to  Or 

sini,  who  was  returning  to  America  in  January,  1867. 

Jung  further  stated  that  through  some  neglect,  Orsini's  name  was  not  inserted 

among  the  printed  list  of the  General  Council. 

The  Council  ordered  this  omission  to  be  repaired  on  the  next  occasion  of print 

ing  the  list  of the  General  ||44|  Council. 

The  Standing  Committee  further  requested  the  Delegates  to  the  Geneva  Con 
gress to  meet together to  settle the form  in which the  minutes  should be printed  and 
to  confirm  the  accuracy  of the  draft  of them  which  had  been  made. 

Balance-Sheet. 

Jung  pressed  upon  the  Council  the  desirability  of  sending  a  copy  of  the  Balance 
Sheet  to  the  Amalgamated  Carpenters'  and  Bricklayers'  Societies  respectively. 

Shaw  said  he  had  been  unable  to  extract  the  balance-sheet  from  Cremer,  who 

had  failed  to  keep  his  promise  to  forward  it  to  him  (Shaw). 

M a z z i n i 's  attitude  towards  t he  Association. 

Orsini,  who  had just  entered  the  room,  desired  to  state  the  substance  of  an  inter 
view  of several  hours'  duration  which  he  had  had  that  morning  with  Joseph  Maz 
zini.  The whole  of that  time  had  been  devoted  to  conversation  concerning  the  Asso 
ciation.  Mazzini  acknowledged  that  he  had  been  deceived  by  the  reports  of Wolff, 
Lama  and  others.  Mazzini  claimed  that  for  35  years  he  had  preached  the  abolition 
of wages'  slavery  and  the  right  of the  workman  to  participate  in  the  profits  of his 
work.  That  for  all  that,  he  did  not  concur  in  every  sentiment  given  utterance  to  in 
the  original  Address  of  the  Association.  That  he  was  ready  to  enter  into  a  debate 
concerning  the  principles  of our  Association;  that  he  would  be  happy  to  receive  a 
deputation  from the  General  Council  to  talk  the  matter  over with him  at  his  private 
house;  that  he  could  not  attend  in  Bouverie  St.  on  account  of the  infirmity  of his 
health,  and  that  he  disavowed  any  responsibility  for  anything  that  might  have  been 
said  by  Wolff or  others  concerning  himself. |

1451  Letters  to  friends  in  America. 

Orsini  requested  Fox  to  write  a  letter  to  six  German  and  French  politicians  whom 
he  named  and  whose  addresses  he  gave  to  Fox  to  inform  them  of  the  objects  for 
which  the  Council  stood  in  need  of funds. 

Fox  undertook  to  write,  as  requested,  immediately.

Dupont,  on  being  interpellated,  stated  that  he  had  received  not  a  single  letter from

Fox  requested  Jung  to  account  to  Shaw  for  the  £4  he  had  in  hand  from  Geneva.

/ 4 5/ Council Meeting Dec'r.  11th 

Citizen  Eccarius  in  the  Chair,  Shaw  Secretary. 

The  minutes  of the  previous  meeting  were  read.  Confirmed. 
Dupont  read  a  Letter  from  the  Paris  Bookbinders  consisting  of men  and  women 
5  who  had joined  the Association;  the  writer  said  it was  a  happy  thing  that  the Asso 
ciation was  in  existence  in  order  to  resist  the  importation  of foreign  Workmen  as  in 
the  case  of the  Basket-makers.  Varlin  said  that  no  Letters  had  been  received  from 
Dupont  for  6  Weeks.  Fribourg,  Chemalé  and  others  had  written,  but  had  received 
no  answers.  The  Letter  contained  a  variety  of addresses  for  Dupont  to  write  to  so  as 
to evade the  Police,  it also requested  Dupont to  state  in each letter that he wrote the 
date  of the  last  letter  he  had  received.

A  letter  was  read  from  the  Tailors  of  Paris,  thanking  the  Tailors  of  London  for 

their  Address  and  promising  to  help  when  need  might  occur.  | 

|46|  A  deputation was present from the  Coach Trimmers  and  Harness makers'  So-
15  ciety, held  at "The Globe," North-Audley-Street, Grosvenor Square. They were anx 
ious to know  something  about the principles  of the Association.  They were  supplied 
with the  Laws  which  they  partly  read  and  then  said  they  would  bring  the  matter  be 
fore  their  Society  on  the  quarterly  Night  which  would  be  on  the  first  Monday  in 
February.  A  deputation  was  promised  to  be  sent  to  them  on  that  night. 

20  Mr  Lee  then  gave  in  the  Address  of  Hatters'  Society  as  follows:  "Anchor  and 
Eight  Bells,"  Bermondsey  Street,  Bermondsey.  The  Secretary's  name  is  William 
Harrison  and  he  works  at  Christy's  in  the  same  street. 

Mr  Lee  also  stated  that  in  consequence  of  the  suspension  of  the  works  of  the 
Messrs.  Waring  the  Belgian  Navvies  were  almost  starving.  He  had  been  making  en-
25  quiries  and he  had found  that Waring's Agent had told  the Belgians  that they  could 
earn  from  5  to  6  Franks  per  day  whereas  they  had  only  been  able  to  earn  from  2/4 
to  3/6  per  day.  The  Agent  had  also  promised  them  25  Franks  each  for travelling  ex 
penses  as  well  as  food,  but they had  had  neither  and  as  none  of them  could  produce 
a  written  agreement  it  was  impossible  to  do  anything  with  the  Messrs  Waring  for 

30  breach of contract. 

Jung  said  he  had  received  a  letter  from  Geneva  stating  that  much  progress  had 
been  made  in  the Association  since  the  Congress.  The  Watch-makers  had joined  in

great  numbers.  Lawrence,  Secretary  of  the  Tailors'  Society  sent  an  apology  to  the 
Council  for  his  non-attendance.  He  should  like  the  meeting-night  changed.  The 
subject  of changing  the  night  was  discussed  with  no  result.  Jung  drew  attention  to 
the  Trades  Council  Meeting  which  would  take  place  on  the  12t h,  the  names  of the 
deputation  were  read  over,  all  that  were  present  were  requested  to  attend.

Citizen  Jung  in  the  Chair,  Shaw  Secretary  pro  tern. 

The  minutes  of the  previous  meeting  were  read  and  confirmed. 
Jung reported  that  the  deputation  had  attended  the Trades  Council  on the  12th  in 
stant but the  meeting was  adjourned untili the  19th  on which date the  council would 
be  heard  on  the  first  opening  of the  business.  The  members  of the  deputation  were 
strictly  enjoined  to  attend. 

Correspondence  from  F r a n ce 

Dupont  stated  that the  two  Letters  that  he  had  sent  to  Lyons  on  the  2nd  and  2 4th  of 
November had  arrived  safe  but  the  Carnets  had  not  arrived  although  they  had  been 
sent  three  weeks  ago.  He  also  read  extracts  from the  "Courrier Français"  which were 
favorable  to  the  association  as  well  as  the  programme  for  electing  the  new  adminis 
tration  of Paris  which  would  be  decided  on  the  1 3th  of January  1867. 

C o r r e s p o n d e n ce  from  Switzerland 

Jung  stated  that  great  activity  was  being  displayed  in  Switzerland  by  the  Associa 
tion.  A  meeting  had  been  held  at  Locle,  on  the  2 5th  of  November.  A  Branch  was 
opened,  a  committee  appointed  and  a  large  number  of members  made,  besides  a 
large  number that had joined  other branches  of the  Association.  Jung  also  said,  that 
branch  of  the  Association  was  being  formed  in  Clerkenwell. 

H o l l a nd 

Van  Rijen  reported  that he  had  translated  the  rules  and  address  and  made  arrange

517 

Minutes  of the  General  Council  of the  I.W.M.A. 

been  commenting  on  the  doings  of  the  Association,  and,  although  they  did  not 
agree  with  the  objects  of the  association  entirely,  still,  they  acknowledged  it  to  be 
one  of the  leading  events of the  present Century.  Marx  also  said  that the  "Fortnight 
ly  Review"  had  been  commenting  on  the  matter. | 

|48|  Celebration  of  t he  Polish  Insurrection  of  1863 

Citizen  Bobczynski  said  he  understood  that  the  council  intended  to  celebrate  the 
Polish  Insurrection  on  the  2 2nd  of January  1867.  He  should  like  to  know  what form 
it  would  take.  After  some  discussion  it  was  agreed  "That  a  tea-party  and  public 
meeting  should  take  place  under  the  auspices  of this  association  and  the  Polish  So 
ciety.  Music  to  accompany  the  tea-party.  Addresses  to  be  delivered  and  resolutions 
submitted  to  the  meeting  and  that  the  standing  Committee  prepare  the  programme 
and  submit  it  to  the  Council  on  its  next  meeting."

V. P. Eccarius  in  the  Chair. 

Fox  stated  that  he  had  received  a  communication  from  the  British  Foreign  Of-
5  fice,  dated  Dec'r.  21/66  and  a  packet  of books,  pamphlets,  newspapers  and  letters. 
The  letter  informed  him  that  the  package  contained  the  papers  etc  seized  upon 
Jules  Gottraux  in  Sept'r.  last  and  for  which  application  [had]  been  made  to  the 
French  Minister of the  Interior  and  to  Lord  Stanley.  Fox  then  detailed the  contents 
of the  package,  which  included  a  bundle  of  copies  of the  Tribune  du  peuple  which 

10  had  not  been  seized  on  Gottraux. 

The  General  Council,  then,  on  the  motion  of Fox,  passed  the  following  resolu 

tion: 

"That  the  General  Council  of  the  International  Workingmen's  Association  ten 
ders  its  thanks  to  Lord  Stanley for his just  and  efficacious  ||49|  intervention with  the 
15  French  Government  with  a  view  to  obtain  for  the  said  General  Council  the  papers 
and  letters  belonging  to  it  which  were  seized  upon  the  person  of Jules  Gottraux,  a 
British  subject,  on  Sept'r.  30,  1866." 

20 

Fox was  directed  and undertook  to  communicate  this  resolution  to  Lord  Stanley. 
In  reference  to  publishing  an  account  of this  transaction,  Fox  argued  against  a 
too  large  ventilation  thereof,  but  recommended  that  its  publication  be  confined 
either to  the  Commonwealth  alone  or to  the  said  paper  and  Reynolds'.  After some  dis 
cussion  it  was  unanimously  resolved  that  it  should  be  published  in  the  Common 
wealth  and  in  Reynolds's. 

T he  Lyons'  silk  weavers. 

25  Fox  asked  for and  received  the  authorisation  of the  Council to  correspond  with  the 
American  Protectionist  Journals  and  Statesmen  in  reference  to  the  Lyons'  silk 
weavers  who  desire  to  emigrate  to  the  United  States.

Correspondence  from  F r a n c e. 

Dupont  said  he  was  happy  to  announce  that  he  had  received  several  communica 
tions  from  the  French  provinces  after  the  interruption  put  to  his  correspondence 
during  the  last  three  months. 

He  read  (1)  a  summary  of a  letter  from  Lefebvre  of Neufchâteau  (Vosges)  which 

called  for  the  compte-rendu  of the  Geneva  Congress. 

(2)  from Fleurieux-sur-Saône which lamented the  seizure  of the  carnets,  sent from 
London,  but  announced  that  they  had  107  members  and  that  their  Cooperative 
Coal  Store  was  succeeding  beyond  their  expectations. | 
|50|  (3)  From  Bordeaux,  calling  for  the  compte-rendu. 
(4)  From  Rouen,  saying  that  the  delay  of the  General  Council  in  publishing  the 
compte-rendu  of the  Congress  was  ruining  the  Association  in  Normandy.  The  letter 
sent  the  contributions  of  20  members  towards  this  object  (in  French  postage 
stamps). 

5.  A  letter  from  Cheval,  a  French  member  in  Belgium,  announcing  the  sale  of 

some  cards. 

Dupont  handed  in  an  article  on  our  Association  published  in  the  Écho  de  la  Gi 
ronde  and  also  the  last  number  of the  Courrier  Français,  containing  an  announce 
ment  from  the  Paris  Managing  Committee  that  the  Mémoire  presented  by  them  to 
the  Geneva  Congress  and  which  had  been  printed  in  Belgium,  because  no  French 
printer  would  publish  it,  had  been  seized  at  the  Belgian  frontier;  also  remarks  by 
the  Editor  of the  Courrier Français. 

Dupont  also  asked for permission  to  cut from  12  copies of the report of the  Gene 
va  Congress  in  the  French  language—about  50  copies  of  which  were  among  the 
papers  received  from  the  British  Foreign  Office—the  pages  containing  the  règle 
ments  of the  Association,  in  order  that  he  might  send  them  by  letter  to  his  corre 
spondents  in  the  provinces  of France.  Leave  granted. 

Jung  gave  some  information  in  reference  to  the  progress  of  the  Association  in 
Switzerland,  and  also  read  some  extracts  from  the  Espiègle  containing  another  ful 
minating  letter from  Vésinier. \

|51|  At  this  moment  a  letter  was  received  from  Citizen  Cremer.  The  letter  con 
tained  the  Balance  Sheet  of the  funds  of the  Association  and  announced  his  resig 
nation  of membership  in  the  Council,  the  reason  being  that  the  Council  had  con 
certed  with  a  trio  of  well-known  ancient  enemies  of  his  to  damage  his  reputation 
and  had  threatened  to  make  public  the  fact  that  he  had  neglected  to  return  the  Bal

Inasmuch  as  Citizen  Odger  had  sent  no  letter  saying  whether  his  engagements 
would  permit  him  to  take  the  chair on  the  2 2n d,  and  inasmuch  as  the  printing  of the

should  be  "The  Chair  will  be  taken  by  a  member  of the  General  Council  of the  In

ers  and  Block-Cutters,  Middleton  Arms,  Mansfield  Street,  Kingsland  Road  at 
tended  for  the  purpose  of  joining  the  ||[52]|  Association.  They  also  stated  that  they 
were  on  strike  against  one  Employer  (Viz  Mr  Huntington  of  Holloway)  and  that 
they  had  been  led  to  believe  that men  had  been  engaged  in  France  to  come  over to 
supplant  them.  Eccarius  then  took  the  Chair  and  Citizen Jung  moved  and  Cit Less

Citizen  Eccarius  in  the  Chair.  The  minutes  of the  previous  meeting  were  read  and 
after  an  addition  suggested  by  Citizen  Fox  confirmed. 

Citizen  Fox  then  asked  the  Council  to  allow  Mr Luscombe  the  "author"  of a  Re 
form  Song  to  use  the  Address  of the  Association  for  the  purpose  [of]  furthering  its 
sale;  permission  was  granted  unanimously. 

Mr  Cohn  then  paid  over  £1.9.0  as  the  Annual  Subscription  from  the  Cigar  Mak 
ers'  Society,  and  stated  that  the  Cigar  Makers  of Bremen  had  applied  to  the  London 
Cigar  Makers  for  copy  of their  Laws  for  the  purpose  [of]  forming  a  Society  at  Bre 
men  on  the  same  principles. | 

|[54]|  Citizen  Fox  reported  that  his  article  on  the  conduct  of the  French  Govern 
ment  with  regard  to  this  Association  and  the  vote  of  thanks  to  Lord  Stanley  was 
published  in  "Commonwealth"  and  "The  International  Courier"  and  suggested  that 
it  should  be  placed  in  the  Minute  Book  which  was  agreed  to  accordingly. 

T he  F r e n ch  G o v e r n m e nt  a nd  the  I n t e r n a t i o n al  Association 
of  Working  M e n. 

During  the  first  two  years  of the  existence  of this  association,  and  until  after  the  as 
sembling  of the  Geneva  Congress,  the  general  council had  little  or no  complaint  to 
make  of the  conduct  of the  French  Government  towards  the  International  Working 
Men's  Association.  The  council's  communications,  with  its  correspondents  in 
France,  were  not  interrupted;  the  sale  of tickets  not  seriously  impeded.  If here  and 
there,  the  local  authorities  threatened  dire  consequences  to  the  council's  agents,  if 
they  proceeded  to  enrol  members,  those  threats  were  but  "brutum  fulmen,"  and 
were  not  executed  upon  those  who  had  the  courage  to  act  in  defiance  of them. 

This  much  is  quite  consistent  with  the  fact  that  the  very  existence  of the  French 
Empire  and  of  the  laws  of  public  safety,  which  it  declares,  are  necessary  for  its 
maintenance,  did  greatly  impede  the  progress  of the  association.  In  the  first  place, 
the  non-existence  of the  right  of public meeting  prevented  the  members  of the  asso 
ciation  from  meeting  together  and  organising  their  sections  in  an  overt  and  formal 

524 

Meeting  of the  General  Council  January  15,  1867 

manner.  But  the  general  council  neither  expected  nor  desired  that  the  laws  of the 
empire  should  be  specially  modified  to  suit  their  interests.  The  damage  done  to 
them in this  manner had  nothing  in  it  "specially"  invidious  to  themselves.  It was  an 
injury  which  was  inflicted  primarily  on  the  whole  French  nation,  and  secondarily 
upon  every  advanced  Liberal  and  Democrat  in  Europe,  all  of whom have  an  interest 
in the  existence  of the  right of public  meeting  in France.  Hence,  they  make  no pub 
lic  complaint  on  this  account. 

In  the  second  place,  the  general  spirit  of terrorism,  upon  which  the  French  Gov 
ernment  so  much  relies,  could  not  but  have  deterred  many  Frenchmen  who  agreed 
with  the  principles  and  design  of the  association,  from  becoming  members  thereof 
and  linking  themselves  to  its  fortunes  in  France.  But  this  damage  also,  is  general 
and  indirect.  Moreover,  it  was  known  to  the  founders  of  the  association  that  this 
would  be  one  of the  obstacles  to  its  success  in  France.  The  general  council  were 
prepared  for  a  certain  amount  of up-hill  work,  in  consequence  of the  prevailing  ter 
ror  in  all  that  relates  to  independent  political  action  in  France,  and  therefore  they 
do  not  come  forward  now  to  make  a  complaint  on  this  score. 

Had  the  French  Government  continued  to  preserve  that  attitude  of (perhaps  con 
temptuous)  neutrality which  it  observed  up  to,  and  during,  the  Congress  of Geneva, 
the  general  council  would  not  have  been  compelled  to  make  the  present  statement 
to  the  members  of the  Association.  But  from  and  after  the  assembling  of the  Con 
gress  at  Geneva  the  French  Government  saw  fit  to  alter  its  attitude  towards  the  as 
sociation.  The  motives  for  this  change  of policy  cannot  be  found  in  any  special  act 
of antagonism  committed  either  by  the  General  council  or  by  the  delegates  to  the 
congress,  French  or  non  French. 

It  would  have  been  the  height  of folly  on  the  part  of the  general  council  or  the 
delegates  of  the  congress  to  court  and  invite  the  hostility  of  the  French  Govern 
ment.  Some  few  Parisian  members  of the  association  who  attended  the  congress  in 
their  individual  capacities  thought  otherwise,  but  as  they  were  not  delegates,  they 
were  not  allowed  to  speak  at  the  congress.  The  delegates  went  about  the  weighty 
business  they  had  in  hand,  and  did  not  diverge  to  the  right  hand  or  to  the  left,  for 
the  purpose  of making  an  anti-Buonapartist  demonstration. 

One  of the  first  signs  of a  change  for the  worse  on  the  part  of the  French  Govern 
ment  was  the  case  of Jules  Gottraux.  Jules  Gottraux  is  a  native  of Switzerland,  and 
a  naturalised  subject  of the  British  State.  He  is  domiciled  in  London,  and  in  Sep 
tember  last  was  on  a  visit  to  his  relatives  in  or  about  Geneva.  The  Managing  Com 
mittees  of the  German-Swiss  and  French-Swiss  sections  at  Geneva  entrusted  to  his 
care  some  letters,  and  a  number  of pamphlets  and  newspapers  relating  to  the  trans 
actions  of the  Association,  which were  all,  without  exception,  to  be  delivered  to  the 
general  council  in London.  On proceeding  from  Geneva  to  London,  on  Sept. 30,  the 
valise  of Gottraux  was  searched  by  French  policemen  at  the  Franco-Swiss  frontier, 
and  these  letters  and  printed  documents  taken  from  him. 

This  was  an  outrage  which  the  general  council,  when  put  in  possession  of  the 
facts,  resolved  not  quietly  to  endure.  That  the  French  Government,  which  enacts 
the  law,  may  make  it  legal  to  seize  printed  matter and  correspondence  coming  from 
abroad  and  directed  to  a  French  citizen,  or  even  a  mere  resident  in  France,  the 

525 

Minutes  of the  General  Council  of the  I.W.M.A. 

council  did  not  deny;  but  for  the  French  Government  to  exercise  the  same  right  of 
paternal  "surveillance"  over  the  communications  between  Switzers  and  Britons,  or 
even  residents  in  Great  Britain,  was  a  stretch  of  authority  that  the  general  council 
felt  itself bound  to  oppose.  The  outrage  was not  aggravated  by  the  fact that the  liter 
ature  seized  in  no  way  concerned  the  French  Government,  and  did  not  belong  to 
the  category  of the  anti-Buonapartist  philippics,  because,  whatever  the  character  of 
the  literature  the  council  denies  the  right of the  French Government,  while  at peace 
with  Switzerland  and  Great  Britain,  to  intercept  the  communications  between  the 
citizens  of the  two  countries. 

The  first  step  taken by  the  council  in this  matter was  to  write  a  respectful letter to 
the  "Ministre  de  l'intérieur,"  stating  the  facts,  requesting  an  inquiry  into  their accu 
racy,  and  terminating  with  a  petition  for  the  surrender  of  the  letters  and  printed 
matter  seized  upon  Gottraux. 

The  council waited five weeks  for a reply  to  their memorial.  None  came,  and  this 
silence  was  a  proof  that  the  French  government  assumed  responsibility  for  the  act 
of its  subordinate  agents.  Only  then  did  the  council  resolve  to  appeal  to  Lord  Stan 
ley,  the  British  secretary for foreign  affairs,  for  redress,  grounding  their  appeal  upon 
the  facts  that  Gottraux  was  a  British  subject,  and  that  the  general  council  was  com 
posed  of subjects  and  denizens  in  Great  Britain. 

Lord  Stanley,  be  it  said  to  his  credit,  heard  this  appeal,  and  directed  Lord  Cow 
ley,  the  British  ambassador  at  Paris,  to  ask  for the  restitution  of the  said  letters  and 
printed  matter. 

On  the  21st  ult.,  the  council  received  a  letter  from  Mr.Hammond  (of the  foreign 
office)  accompanying  a  parcel  sealed  with  the  seal  of the  British  embassy.  The  letter 
informed  the  council  that  the  parcel  contained  the  papers  which  had  been  seized 
upon  Gottraux. 

It  did  contain  the  confiscated  letters  and  printed  matter,  and  also,  strange  to  say, 
some  newspapers  not  seized  upon  Gottraux,  nor  coming  from  Switzerland.  These 
newspapers  were  two  bundles  of the  Brussels  "Tribune  du  Peuple,"  a  paper  doubt 
less  highly  obnoxious  to  the  French  Government,  and  the  principal  organ  of the  as 
sociation  in  Belgium.  These  papers  had  been  addressed  to  some  French  members, 
and  the  council  far  from  having  demanded  their  restitution,  were  unaware  of their 
having  been  seized.  These  two  bundles  had  upon  them  the  official  seal  of  the  ad 
ministration  of public  safety.  | 

¡[55]J  In  order to  conclude  this  case  of Gottraux's,  the undersigned  inserts  here  a 

resolution  passed  on  the  first  instant,  by  the  general  council. 

"Resolved,  that  the  general  council  of  the  international  workingmen's  associa 
tion  tenders  its  thanks  to  Lord  Stanley  for  his just  and  efficacious  intervention  with 
the  French  Government  with  a  view  to  obtain  for  the  said  general  council  the  pa 
pers  and  letters  belonging  to  it,  which  were  seized  upon  the  person  of  Jules  Got 
traux,  a British  subject,  on  Sep. 30,1866,"  at  the  same  time  the  undersigned  was  di 
rected  to  communicate  a  copy  of the  same  without  delay,  to  Lord  Stanley. 

In  November  last,  citizen  Dupont,  the  council's  secretary  for  France,  found  that 
letters  sent  by  him  to  the  association's  agents  in  France  were  seized,  and  also  that 
letters  directed  to  him  from  all  parts  of France  did  not  come  to  hand.  "A  fortiori," 

526 

Meeting  of the  General  Council  January  15,  1867 

the  French  post-office  was  closed  against  the  delivery  of printed  matter  addressed 
by  the  council  to  its  agents  in  France,  and  "vice  versa." 

Of course  citizen  Dupont  can  no  longer  confide  in  the  French  post-office. 
The  latest  news  under  this  head  is  that,  whereas  the  blockade  against  printed 
matter  directed  to  French  citizens  and  members  of  the  association  is  still  strin 
gently  enforced;  letters  from  the  French  provinces  directed  to  Dupont  have  of late, 
once more,  come through,  although letters  so  directed from Paris  continue  to  be  de 
tained! 

Another fact  is  reported  in  the  last number  of the  "Courrier Français."  The  inter 
esting  essay  contributed  by  the  Parisian  delegates  to  the  Geneva  congress,  parts  of 
which  have  already  been  published  in  the  "Courrier  Français"  without  evil  conse 
quences,  was  sent to  Brussels  to  be  printed,  only  because  no  printer  in  Paris  would 
undertake  to  execute  the job.  This  memorial,  be  it said, is directed  against  the  capi 
talist  class,  but  is  silent  concerning  the  present  Government  of France.  Neverthe 
less,  the  printed  edition  of this  memorial  has  been  seized  by  the  postal  authorities 
of France  and  confiscated. 

Under  these  circumstances  it  is  impossible  to  say  how  long  the  French  Govern 
ment  will  continue  to  allow  the  sale  of tickets  of membership  in  the  association, 
and  abstain  from  persecuting  the  prominent  members  thereof,  who  live  subject  to 
its jurisdiction. 

By  order  of the  General  Council,

Jan.  5,  1867. 

Citizen  Jung  then  reported  his  mission  to  the  Coach Makers'  Friendly  Society  held 
25  at the  Green Man,  Berwick  Street  and  concluded  by moving that the  Coach Makers 
be  accepted  as  an  affiliated  Society.  The  motion  was  agreed  to  unanimously  and 
'  Citizen  Reaveley  was  elected  as  the  Delegate  on  this  Council  to  represent  that  So 
ciety.  Citizen  Reaveley  then  paid  5/as  enrolment  fee  for his  Society  and  1/0  as  his 
Contribution.

A  letter  was  read  from  Citizen  Odger  stating  that  the  Resolution  passed  by  the

per  of that  day.

At a meeting  of the  London Trades  Council,  held  last night  at the  Bell Inn,  Old  Bai 
ley,  Mr. Danter  (president  of the  Society  of Amalgamated  Engineers)  in  the  chair, 
the  following  resolution  was  unanimously  adopted:—"That  this  meeting  is  of opin 
ion that the position  of the working man  can never be  much  improved,  and  is  in  im-
40  minent  danger  of being  seriously  depreciated,  whilst  the  people  of different  coun 
tries  have  no  regular  intercommunication  among  themselves  for  the  purpose  of 

527 

Minutes  of the  General  Council  of the  I.W.M.A. 

regulating  the  hours of labour and  assimilating  wages.  And  as  the  International  As 
sociation  affords  the  best  facilities  for  bringing  about  that  object,  it  is  hereby  re 
solved  to  co-operate  with  that  association  for  the  furtherance  of all  questions  affect 
ing  the  interests  of labour;  at  the  same  time  continuing  the  London  Trades  Council 
as  a  distinct  and  independent  body  as  before." 

A  letter  was  read  from  the  Secretary  of the  Reform  League  inviting  this  Council 
to  take  part  in  the  coming  demonstration  and  requesting  the  appointment  of Del 
egates  to  attend  the  Meeting  at  Newman  Street  on  the  16"1  instant.  ||[56]|  Lessner, 
Carter,  Collet  and  Shaw  were  appointed  to  attend. 

Blockcutters'  dispute 

Citizen  Collet  stated,  that  since  the  last  meeting  he  had  been  trying  to  bring  the 
Blockcutters'  dispute  to  an  end.  He  had  seen  Mr Huntington  of Holloway  who  had 
written  to  Lancashire  for  the  Employers'  statement  of the  Case.  The  employers  had 
refused  to  send  their  statement  to  Citizen  Collet  untili  they  knew  who  he  was  and 
whom  he  represented.  Citizen  Collet  then  asked  the  Council  to  give  him  authority 
to  write  to  these  said  employers  for  their  statement  of the  Case. 

A Resolution  was  submitted  giving  Citizen  Collet  the  required  authority.  But,  on 
the  motion  of  Shaw  seconded  by  Jung  the  subject  was  adjourned  untili  the  next 
meeting  and  in  the  meantime  a  deputation  should  be  invited  to  attend  from  Block-
cutters'  Society. 

Shaw  reported  that he  had  waited  upon  the  Organ  Builders'  Society  on  the  previ 
ous  evening.  He  had  received  the  enrolment  fee  5/0  and  the  form  of  application 
filled up. 

Mr  Miall's  bill  was  read  demanding  the  rent  of the  Office.  It  was  proposed,  sec 

onded  and  carried  that  £2.10.0  be  paid  to  Mr  Miall. 

Jung  said  that  Dupont  had  received  a  letter  [from]  Vienne,  stating  that  they  had 

300  Members  and  they  wanted  their  carnets. 

Jung  said  he  had  received  a  letter  from  Mr Applegarth  inviting  him  to  meet  a 
gentleman  at  his  office,  who  was  very  favorable  to  the  objects  of our  Association 
and  who  owned  property  at  Lausanne.

Fox  reported  that  the  standing  Committee  had  agreed  that  4  Resolutions  should  be 
submitted  to  the  meeting. |

pointed  to  take  the  Chair  at  the  Polish  Demonstration. 

A  letter  was  read  from  Mr  Roberti  of Lea,  Kent,  expressing  a  desire  to  take  part 
in  the  Demonstration,  the  letter was  left  with  Fox  to  answer  as  he  might  think best.

The  Secretary  then  read  several  letters  which  he  had  received  since  the  last meet-
ing.  One  was  from  Miss  Hosburgh  in  reply  to  a  vote  of thanks  sent  to  her  by  the 
Council.  Another  was  from  the  Coventry  Weavers'  Association  with  the  annual 
Subscription  of  1.13.4.  And  two  were  from  the  Lancashire,  Derbyshire,  Yorkshire 
and  Cheshire  Block-Printers'  Union  with  the  entrance-fee  of  the  Society  and  an 
nual  Subscription  for  1,000  members.  It  was  then  moved  by  Cit Jung  and  seconded 
rIO.  by  Cit  Lessner That  the  L. D. Y.  and  C.  Block-Printers'  Union  be  accepted  as  an  af 

filiated  Branch  of this  Association. 

Citizen  Fox  then  read  several  letters  for  Citizen  Dupont.  One  was  from  the  Edi 
tor of the  Courrier Français  giving  reasons  for  declining  to  publish  the  transactions 
of the  Geneva  Congress;  another  was  from  Varlin  of Paris  Bookbinders.  This  letter 
:15  Varlin  wished  to  be  read  to  the  London  Bookbinders  by  some  members  of  the 

Council.  It  also  announced  that  Varlin  had  sent  18  Francs  to  the  Council. 

It  was  then  proposed  and  seconded  that  a  Deputation  wait upon  the  Bookbinders 
in  order to  deliver the  statement  of the  Paris  Bookbinders  and  that  ||[58]|  the  Secre

A  place  which  had  caused  him  to  alter  his  opinion  on  the  subject.  Mr Shettleworth 
said  he  thought  the  Council  might  render  some  service  by  holding  some  communi

of his  inability  to  find  two  sureties  to  the  Government.  Collet  had  one,  a  French 
man.  He  wanted  a  Briton  for  the  second.  Fox  thought  as  the  two journals  were  ad 
vocating  the  principles  of the  Council,  they  should  help  Collet  over  the  difficulty.

The  Swiss  section  having  demanded  that  the  programme  of the  Lausanne  Con 
gress  be  drawn up  and  published  forthwith.  The  standing  Committee  thought  it best 
not  to  comply  with  that  demand  but  instead  thereof,  to  refer  for  study  as  the  only 
urgent  and  special  question  of the  moment  "The  means  of making  Credit  Available 
for the Working  Classes."  This recommendation  |][68]|  was unanimously  confirmed

Fox  stated that 2  quires  of International Courier would  be wanted to  supply  English 
Societies  and  American  Correspondents,  and  2¾  quires  of  Courrier  International 
for  Continental  Correspondents.  He  thought  it  would  take  seven  numbers  without 
the  French  Essay.  Fox moved  and  Carter  seconded That 2  quires  of the  I.C.  and 2% 
of C. I.  be  ordered  weekly  untili  the  report  is  concluded.  Carried  Nem  Con.

Cigar makers'  Society  of 300  members  had  several branches  in  the  North  (they  were

belonged  to  us. 

Odger  said  he  was  going  to  Manchester  and  he  would  see  what  he  could  do  for

had  waited  upon  the  Curriers  and  Tin  Plate  Workers  but  should  wait  upon  them 
again.  The  Engineers  had  not  done  anything,  because  they  had  not  received  any  of 
their  loans  yet.  The  Bricklayers'  money  had  not  yet  arrived  at  Paris.  Dupont  stated 
La  Voix  de  l'Avenir  contained  an  Article  on  the  Bronze  Workers'  Lock  Out. 

Carter  called  attention  to  the  Engine  Drivers'  Strike  and  said  we  had  fallen  short 

of  our  mission  in  that  Case. 

Dupont  said  he  had  waited  upon  the  Committee  at  31  Bridge  Street,  Strand  as 
soon  as  he  heard  of the  affair  and  communicated  with  the  Continent  that  same  day, 
some  sharp  discussion  followed  and  Jung  and  Dupont  were  appointed  to  do  what 
they  could  with  the  Engine  Drivers'  Committee  to  forward  the  objects  of this  Asso

meeting  could  be  read. 

Fox  was  appointed  minute  taker  for  the  Evening. 
Fox  brought  up  a  resolution  from  the  standing  Committee  to  the  Effect  that  a 

Balance  Sheet  be  made  out  and  the  Accounts  be  audited. 

Agreed  to  nem  con— 
Hales  asked  for a report  of the  Congress  for his  Society,  and  Cohn  requested  that 
copies  of the  Courier  containing  a  translation  of the  Parisian  Mémoire  be  furnished 
to  his  Society.  It was  order'd  that  a note  of these  requests  be  made  in  the  minutes. 
Hales  thought  that  the  Courier  should  be  pushed  amongst  the  Affiliated  Societies. 
After  a  Short  discussion  the  subject  was  adjourned  untili  next week  and  Fox  under 
took  [to]  ask  Collet  to  attend. 

George  Draitt was nominated  as  a member of the Council.  2/2  was paid to Fox as 
Subscription  from  Lawrence  and  Druitt.  A  Delegate  from  the  Coach  Trimmers'  So 
ciety  held  at  the  "Globe,"  North  Audley  ||[71]|  Street,  Grosvenor  Square  paid  5/0 
entrance  fee  for  his  Society  to join  the  Association. 

Dupont  read  a  letter  from  Fribourg  (Paris)  stating  that  the  French  Trades  had 
advanced  something  like  £4,000  to  the  Bronze  Workers.  It  stated  that  the  Lock  out 
was  at  an  end,  but  that  17  of the  most  active  members  had  been  excluded  from  the 
shops.  The  Chairman  then  reported  that  the  Cigar  makers  had  voted  £5.0.0  which 
had been  sent to Paris,  also that Bricklayers'  money had not yet  arrived in Paris.  He 
then  asked:  now  the  Lock-out  was  at  an  end  could  he  canvass  Trades  Societies  for 
money?  Cohn  and  Hales  replied  that  so  long  as  17  men were  locked  out,  the  Lock 
out  could  not  be  at  an  end,  and  Jung  declared  himself  satisfied  by  this  response 
from  two  representatives  of  English  Trades  Unions. 

Citizen  Conn  stated  that  the  Cigar Trade  was  very  slack.  It  would  be  worse  before 
it  was  better—one  seventh  of their  men  was  out  of work.  Still  Belgians,  Dutch  and 
Hamburgers  were  coming  over  here  and  suffering  greatly.  They  were  working  at 
very low prices  having  no  other alternative but to  starve.  He  said  a very  skilfull Hol 
lander  was  working  for  1/9  per  hundred  while  he,  Cohn,  was  getting  3/6  per  hun 
dred  for  the  same  kind  of work.  He  requested  the  Dutch,  Belgian  and  German  Sec-

not  more  than  25  men  out  [of  work]  belonging  to  the  Society  the  Continentals 
might  come  and  welcome.  It  was  order'd  that  the  above  matter  be  attended  to  at

Members  present,  Jung,  Maurice,  Lessner,  Hales,  Lafargue,  Dupont,  Collet,  Fox, 
Shaw  and  Cohn. 

Fox read  the  minutes  of the  previous  meeting  and  they were  confirmed.  Fox  pro-

-  posed  and  Maurice  seconded William  Hales  as  member  of the  Council.  Carried. 

Maurice  proposed  and  Dupont  seconded  George  Druitt  President  of the  London 

Tailors'  Society  as  a  member  of the  Council.  Carried. 

A  letter was  read  from  the  Reform  League  requesting  a  Delegate  to  attend  at  the 
Sussex Hotel on the  1 7th instant to  receive  a  memorial Tablet in commemoration of 
the  Reform  Demonstration,  of Feb'y  1 1th  1867. 

10 

Citizen  Collet  was  appointed  to  receive  the  Tablet  on  behalf of the  Council. 
Fox  read  a  letter  from  Mrs  Harriet  Law  on  the  subject  of "Women's  Rights"  and 
expressed  his  opinion  that  perhaps  Mrs  Law  would  go  to  the  Congress  at  Lausanne 
if solicited.  By  mutual  consent Fox undertook  to  write  to  Mrs  Law asking her if she 

-15  would  be  willing  to  attend  the  Council  meetings  if invited. 

Dupont  read  a  letter  from  Paris.  It  expressed  regret  that  the  Tailors'  deputation 
from  London  to  Paris  had  not  been  introduced  to  the  Paris  Tailors  by  the  Paris  Ad 
ministration  of our  Association.  Maurice  stated  that  the  London Tailors'  Executive 
had  no  time  to  consult us  previous  to  sending  their  deputation  to  Paris,  and  moved 
20  That  a Deputation be  sent to the Tailors'  Meeting  at the Alhambra Palace  on Mon 
day  the  22n d.  This  motion  ||[73]|  was  seconded  by  Citizen  Cohn  and  Citizens  Du 
pont  and  Collet  and  Jung  were  appointed  as  the  Delegates  to  attend. 

Jung  reported  his  attendance  on  the  Tin  Plate  Workers,  "Black  Jack,"  and  the 
Hatters,  "Prince  and  Princess,"  Gravel  Lane.  The  Hatters  had  lent  £10.0.0  to  the 
. 25  Bronze  Workers  of Paris.  They  required  a  written  statement  of our  objects  to  send 
round  to  their  Shops  before  they  could  do  anything  towards  becoming  affiliated  to 
our  Association. 

The  payment  of  Secretary  for  the  labors  of the  office  was  adjourned  to  the  next 

meeting  by  common  consent. 

30 

Lafargue  (on  behalf of Marx)  said  that  the  Resolution  moved  by  Odger at  one  of 
the  Reform  Meetings,  conferring  a  vote  [of]  thanks  upon  Count  Bismarck  was  cal 
culated  to  injure  the  Credit  [of]  this  Association.  He  therefore  demanded  that  a 
vote  of censure  should  be  passed  upon  Odger.

Courrier  International  and  International  Courier. 

It  was  proposed,  seconded  and  carried  unanimously,  "That  this  Council  recom

resentative  organ  of  the  principles  of  the  Association  and  that  this  recommenda

Members  present,  Citizens  Jung,  Maurice,  Fox,  Collet,  Lessner,  Dupont,  Lafargue, 
Zabicki,  Dell,  Carter,  Eccarius,  Shaw  and  Buckley. 

,.5 

The  minutes  of  the  previous  meeting  were  read  and  confirmed.  The  Secretary 
read  a  Letter  from  John  Sutcliffe  of  the  Block-Printers'  Union.  It  stated  that  they 
had  90  men  on  Strike  against  the  introduction  of  the  cheap  labor  of Women  and 
asked  for  pecuniary  Assistance  as  their  Trade  was  very  much  depressed  and  they 
were  unable  to  meet  their  outlay. 

Citizen  Dell  moved  and  Lessner  seconded,  That  the  Secretary  write  for  a  state 
lo  ment of facts,  and  point  out the  mode  of application which  is  generally  made  to  the 
; 

Trades  Council  of London  for  pecuniary  assistance.  Carried. 

Citizen  Collet  reported  that  a  Continental  Subscriber  to  the  Courrier  Interna 
tional  had  written  to  him  requesting  information  about  the  association  with  a  view 
of joining  and  opening  a  Branch.

T he  Tailors'  M e e t i ng 

Citizen  Collet  reported  that  himself and  Jung  attended  the  Tailors'  Meeting  at  the 
Alhambra Palace. Jung was introduced as the President of the late Congress at Gene 
va  and  was  received  with  immense  applause.  He  pointed  out  to the  meeting,  that  if 
the  I.  W.  A.  could,  last  year,  prevent  the  Tailors  of Paris  from  Supplanting  the  men 
20  of London,  it  could  do  the  same  thing  with the  men  of Belgium  and  Germany  this 
year—Consequently  the  Master Tailors  would  only  be  wasting  money  by  sending  to 
those  Countries  for  men.  Collet  also  address'd  the  Meeting  and  Eccarius  said  that 
Collet's  speech had  made him a most popular man  amongst the  Tailors  of London.  | 
|[75]|  It  was  then  moved  by  Maurice  and  seconded  by  Collet,  That  the  Council 
25  make  a  special  point  of sending  deputations  to  all  Trade  Meetings  possible.  Car 

ried.

Jung  reported  that with  Dupont  he  had  had  an  Interview  with  Engine  Drivers'  Sec 
retary respecting  this Association.  He was  to  wait upon  the  Executive  as  soon  as he 
received  a  letter  from  the  Secretary. 

Citizen Eccarius  then  took  the  Chair.  And  Citizen  Jung proposed  and  Citizen  La^

Jung  then  suggested  that  a  special  Fund  be  created  by  Voluntary  Contributions

making  a  sum  total  of  10/6.  It  was  then  proposed  by  Citizen  Lessner  and  seconded 
by  Citizen  Fox,  That  the  Secretary  be  paid  10/0  per  week.  Carried. 

Lafargue  then  introduced  the  subject  of  Odger  proposing  a  vote  of  thanks  to 
Count  Bismarck  at  a  Reform  Meeting,  after some  discussion  in  which  several  mem 
bers  took  part the following  resolution  propos'd  by Cit  Lessner and  seconded by  Cit 
izen  Lafargue  was  carried  unanimously.  Resolved,  "That  inasmuch  as  Citizen 
Odger  has  proposed  a  resolution  at  the  Council  of  the  Reform  League  thanking 
Mr.  ||[76]|  Bismarck  for  what  he  has  done  for  the  Democratic  cause  in  Germany, 
and  inasmuch  as  Citizen  Odger  is  President  of  the  International  Working  Men's 
Association,  the  General  Council  feels  it  to  be  its  duty  to  repudiate  any  solidarity 
with  the  said  resolution  and  with  Citizen  Odger's  speech  in  support  thereof." 

Mr  Moller  stated that  the  Coach Trimmers'  Society,  meeting  at  the  Crown,  Broad 
Street,  Golden  Square  had  decided  to  become  affiliated  to  this  Association.  He 
paid  over  10/0  on  behalf  of  the  Society. 

Fox  then gave  notice  that  on  next  meeting  night  he  would  move  that  deputations 

be  appointed  to  wait  upon  the  Postmaster-General  on  International  Postage. 

The  Meeting  then  adjourned. /

Members  present,  Citizens  Eccarius,  Lessner,  Jung,  Fox,  Lafargue,  Hales,  Collet, 
Maurice,  Carter,  Dell,  Buckley and  Shaw.  Citizen Eccarius  took the  Chair.  The  min 
utes  of the  previous  meeting  were  read  and  after  being  amended  were  confirmed. 
The  Secretary  read  a  letter  from  the  Curriers'  Society  anent  their quarterly  meet 
ing.  He  was  ordered  to  answer the  said  letter  and  express  regret  that  it  had  come  to 
hand  too  late  for  the  Council  to  attend. 

A  letter  was  read  from  the  Commonwealth  Office  asking  for  the  payment  of the 
account  due  for  advertisement.  It  was  then  proposed,  seconded  and  carried  That 
£1.0.0  be  paid  on  account  of advertisement  in  the  Commonwealth.  It  was  also  pro 
posed,  seconded  and  carried That  Citizen  Collet be paid  11/3  ||[77]|  the balance  due 
for  the  printing  of the  French  Carnets. 

The  Secretary stated  that  since  the  last meeting he  had written  to  the  Hatters'  So 
ciety,  to  Mr  John  Kane,  of 21  Hood  Street,  Gateshead,  Durham,  the  Secretary  of 
the  Northern  Iron  Workers'  Association  and  to  Mr Woodhatch  the  Secretary  of the 
Liverpool  Cigar  makers,  66  Copperas  Hill,  Liverpool  asking  them  to  use  their  influ 
ence  to  cause  their  Societies  to  join  the  Association.  He  also  stated  that  he  had 
written  to  Mr  John  Sutcliffe  the  Secretary  of the  Block  printers  as  directed  at  the 
previous  meeting.  Carter  drew  the  attention  of the  Council  to  the  fact  that  himself 
and  Jung  had  not  yet  received  the  £1.0.0  due  to  each  of them  on  account  of their 
expenses  to  the  Geneva  Congress  when  it  was  proposed  by  Citizen  Dell  and  sec 
onded  by  Citizen  Collet That  the  claim  of Carter  and  Jung  be  the  next  that  is  paid. 
Jung  read  from  the  April  Bulletin  of  the  Lausanne  section  a  paragraph,  which 
stated  that very few  sections  had paid  their 3d  Contribution towards  the  expenses  of 
the  General  Council,  and  in  consequence  of this  default  the  General  Council  had 
been  impeded  in  its  task  of bringing  out  the  report  of the  Geneva  congress. 

Jung  also  read  a  Letter from  Besson the  Belgian  Secretary  which  also  had  a letter 

enclosed  from  Vésinier. | 

|[78]|  Citizen  Eccarius  read  the  programme  of  the  Working  men's  party  of  Ger 
many  from  the  Vorbote which was  as  follows,  "The  Working  men's  party  adheres  to 
the  maxim  that  the  oppressed  of  all  European  Countries  without  distinction  of 
creed,  state  or  race  are  by  their  interest  bound  to  unite  and  render  each  other  mu-

Minutes  of the  Generai  Council  of the  I. W. M. A. 

tual  assistance."  Citizen  Fox  drew  the  attention  of the  Council to  the  "American,"  a 
new  democratic  Journal  which  had  just  reached  its  5th  number. 

In  answer  to  a  question  about  the  rent  of the  office  Citizen  Collet  made  an  offer 
of a  room  at  his  place  of business  at  about  £6.0.0  per  year.  Fox  moved  that  the  sub­
ject  be  referred  to  the  sub-Committee,  which  was  agreed  to  accordingly. 

Citizen  Collet  read  the  following  letter,  which  he  had  written 

To  Edmund  Beaks,  Esq.  Μ.  Α.,  President  of  the  Reform  League. 

Sir, 

I  am  sorry,  I  was  not  in  time  at  the  last  delegate  meeting  to  hear  your  statement 
about  the  measures  the  executive  committee  of  the  League  had  adopted  to  carry 
out  Mr. Cremer's  motion,  as  they  had  been  requested  to  do  on  the  previous  Wednes­
day. 

I  find  from  the  "organ  of  the  Reform  movement,"  the  Commonwealth,  that  you 
stated  that  "the  Council  of the  League,  acting  upon  the  resolution  of last  week,  had 
decided  upon  holding  not  a  promenade,  as  at  first  intended,  but  a  bona fide meeting 
in  Hyde  Park  on  the  6th  of May  next,"  and  that,  "if any  riot  or  disturbance  ensued 
the  blame  must  rest  on  the  Government."  I  find  it  also  stated  that  Mr. Bradlaugh 
said  that  "the  League  had  not  only  called  the  meeting  in  Hyde  Park,  but  meant  to 
hold  it  there,  come  what  might.  On  this  occasion  they  would  not  only  demand  ad­
mittance  to  the  Park,  but  enforce  that  admittance  if required." 

I  hope,  Sir,  you  will  allow  me  to  make  a  few  remarks  on  this  important  subject. 
I  hold  that the  people  have  a  right  to  meet  in  the  Park,  but  I  hold  also,  that  before 
such  a  serious  issue  as  a  defiance  to  the  authorities  is  raised,  men  should  be  pre­
pared  to  act  as  men  and  not  as  bombastic  children. 

When  I  proposed  some  time  ago  a  promenade  in  Hyde  Park  on  Good  Friday  and 
I  felt  convinced  that  the  Government  would  not,  and  could  not  prevent  the  people 
from  going  into  the  Park  individually  and  would  not  even  interfere,  if once  there, 
the  people  held  a  meeting. 

Some  of my  friends  have  tested  the  question  and  it  has  been  proved  that  I  was 

right. 

Now  I  believe  that  when  the  delegates  voted  for  Mr. Cremer's  motion  on  the  17th 

inst.  their  impression  was  that  the  same  course  should  be  adopted. 

From  what  I  have  quoted  above,  from  the  Commonwealth,  it  would  appear  that 
you,  with  the  executive,  are  determined  to  call forth  a  demonstration  similar  to  that 
of July  last  and  that  if  the  authorities  adopt  the  same  course  they  did  then,  either 
an  appeal  to  force  must  be  the  result,  or  Reformers  would  have  once  more  to  retire. 
I  believe  that  it  would  be,  not  only  unpolitic  but  criminal  to  bring  the  question  to 
such  an  issue  as  this,  and  I  will  give  you  my  reasons: — 

If  the  people  of  this  country  are  really  prepared  to  join  issue  with  the  govern­
ment,  then  they  have  something  better  to  do  than  to  fight  their  fellow  men  of the 
army  and  the  police,  about  a  question  of  admittance  into  the  park. 

However  important  the  question  of  the  right  of  meeting  may  be,  if  to  settle  it 

552 

Meeting  of the  General  Council  April  30,  1867 

force  must  be  resorted  to  and  blood  spilt,  then  the  people  must  be  prepared  either 
to  submit  or  to  destroy  the  present  political  fabric. 

I  think they  are  not yet ripe  for  such  an  issue,  and  therefore  I  say  that  it would be 
unwise  and  criminal to  necessarily  produce  violence  and bloodshed,  to  no  practical 
purpose. 

Suppose  that  the  Reformers  were  even  to  force  their  way  into  the  park,  what 

then?  Do  you  think  that  the  Government  would  stop  there? 

What  if they  bring  armed  force  against  you?  Are  you  prepared  to  meet  them? 
What  if Parliament  were  to  pass  a  bill  forbidding  meetings  in  the  parks?  Would 

you  then  turn  Parliament  out? 

I  conclude  by  urging  upon  you  to  use  your  influence  upon your  colleagues  of the 
Council  to  reconsider  a  decision,  which  I  do  not  think  they  were  empowered  to 
take,  by the delegates,  and simply to invite the Reformers of London to go  individu 
ally  to  the  Park,  avoiding  anything  that  might  have  the  appearance  of  a  defiance, 
which  they  are  not  prepared  to  support  effectively. 

When  the  time  comes,  if unfortunately  it  ever  should  come,  that  force  must  be 
used,  I  hope  the  people  of this  country will be  wise  enough to  discriminate  between 
those who  really  are  their  enemies  and  those  of their own ranks  and blood whose  in 
terests  are  the  same  as  theirs,  although  they  may  for  a  time  be  in  the  ranks  of the 
army  or  the  police. 

It  is  not  against  men  obliged  then  to  earn  their  livelihood  that  the  working  men 
ought  [to]  turn  their  wrath.  I  hope  they  will  have  more  sense  than  to  do  that,  and 
that  they  will  strike  the  evil  at  the  root. 

I  am  Sir 
Yours  respectfully. 

Joseph Collet. \

the  Council  on  the  nomination  of  Cits  Shaw  and  Dell.  The  Secretary  stated,  that 
since  the  last  meeting  he  had  written  to  Brass  Finishers  at  the  "Cheshire  Cheese," 
Mount  Pleasant,  Clerkenwell to  receive  a  deputation  from  the  Council.  He  had  also

My  Lord 
I  am  directed  to  respectfully  request  your  Lordship  to  be  good  enough  to  receive  a 
deputation  on  the  subject  of International  Postage  from  the  Central  Council  of the 
above  Association. 

The  Council  would  take  it  as  an  additional  favor  if your  Lordship  would  appoint 

a  day  as  near  the  middle  of the  present  month  as  possible  for the  above  purpose. 

I  am  My  Lord  very  obediently

¡[801J  He  had  also written  to  5  Branches  of the Amalgamated  Bakers'  Union  enclos 
ing  Rules  and  Address  and  soliciting  them  to  become  affiliated  to  our  Association. 
He  drew  the  attention  of the  Council  to  the  fact  that  the  Bakers'  Executive  met  at 
the  Working  Men's  Hall,  Harp  Alley,  Farringdon  Street  every  Tuesday  Night  and 
he  was  instructed  to  communicate  with  that  Body. 

Jung  said  he  had  received  a  Letter  from  Basle  containing  the  prices  of Silk  Weav 
ing  as  requested  by  the  Coventry  Silk Weavers;  of which the following  is  the  transla 
tion 

In  accordance with your desire  I hereby  send  you  a  summary of the  wages  paid  in 

554 

Meeting  of the  General  Council  May  7,  1867 

the  Factories.  For  the  so  called  Weft  17  Centimes  is  paid  for  100  threads;  a  day's 
wages  is  1/3.  The  average  wages  used  to  be  1/8  per  day. 

Piece  Work.  Nos 24  to  46  =  10  reeds,  300  to  320  Shuttles  per inch,  24  Francs  and 
73  Centimes  a  piece.  Nos  24  to  46 = 8  reeds,  200  Shuttles  per  inch  18  Francs  and 
:5  50 Centimes a piece.  Nos 21 to  40,  8 reeds,  7  times  (something incomprehensible to 
the  translator)  21  Francs  a piece.  Nos  14  to  36,  10  reeds,  double  Shuttle,  200  picks 
per  inch,  17  Francs  and  25  Centimes  a  piece—a  piece  is  equal  to  120  staves. 

With  13  hours work a day,  at  the  very  utmost  only 2  staves  can  be made  in a  day, 
and  the  Wages  never  exceed  10  fr  a  week,  it  is  indeed  more  frequent  that  a  fort-
10  night's  hard  work  only  amounts  to  15  fr.  Not  only  reduced  prices  but  bad  silk  has 
contributed  to  bring  about  this  deplorable  state  of  things.  Formerly  20  Centimes 
were  paid  per  100  threads;  and  with  good  silk  25  fr  could  be  earned  in  a  fortnight; 
Now  the  earnings  are  commonly  from  8  to  10  fr.—on  rare  occasions  12  fr. 

The  Secretary  was  ordered  to  send  a  Copy  of this  translation  to  Coventry.

Citizen Jung  also  read  a letter from  Geneva which  stated  that  a new  Council had

the  list  of Councilmen.  He  also  read  a  letter  from  Chaux-de-Fonds  requesting  that 
the  following  subject  should  be  put  on  the  programme  of  the  next  Congress,  Viz. 
"Slackness  of Trade.  Its  Causes  and  Remedies." 

Jung  read  (on  behalf  [of]  Dupont)  a  letter  from  Lyons,  the  said  letter  requested 
the  Council  to  forward  the  address  of  the  Lyonnese  to  the  German  Working  men 
through the  German  Newspapers;  the  subject  of the  Address  was  threatened  War  in 
Germany,  and  it  was  ordered  to  be  sent  to  Citizen  Marx  through  Lessner.

A  letter was  read  from  Brussels  stating  that  the  chiefs  of the  Firms  in  the  Tailor-
ing trade had  signed a tariff agreeable to  the men  and that  on the  2 1st of April Large 
meetings  of Tailors,  Cabinet  makers,  Marble  Polishers,  and  Dyers  had been  held  on 
the  Wages  question. 

A  Letter  was  read  from  Chemale  of  Paris  stating  that  the  Tailors  had  gone  to 
work  at  an  advance  of  10  per  cent  instead  of the  20  per  cent  for  which  they  struck. 
»  30  The 10 per cent was accepted by a small minority in the first place,  and the Govern 
ment  withheld  their  authority  for  the  holding  of  a  meeting  to  the  trade.  Conse 
quently  the  Strike  Committee  had  resigned  and  given  up  the  Contest. 

This  letter  stated  that  the  Paris  Administration  had  spent  £7.0.0  in  propagandism 
and  that  was  the  reason  why  they  had  not  sent  their  3d  contribution  to  the  General 
:  35  Council.  It  also  suggested  that  a  certain  number of Delegates from  various  sections 
should  assemble  5  days  before  the  opening  of Congress  for the  purpose  of arranging 
matters  so  as  to  ||[82]|  save  the  time  of the  Delegates  when  assembled  in  Congress. 
The  letter  stated  that  a  new  Branch  had  opened  at  Amiens.  That  the  Rope-makers 
of Paris  had  been  on  strike  6  weeks,  and  that  the  Turners'  branch  of the  Bronze 
40  Makers'  Trade  was  not  yet  settled.  The  Bookbinders  of  Paris  were  desirous  of 
fraternising  with  the  Bookbinders  of London  if  any  of them  went  over  to  the  exhi 
bition. 

The  President  (Odger)  then  drew  attention  to  the  vote  of the  Council  in  reference 
to  the  Resolution  moved  by  him  at  a  Meeting  of  the  Reform  League  and  having 
45  stated  that the  resolution was  meant  simply to  thank  Count Bismarck  for giving  the 

555 

Minutes of the General  Council  of the  I. W. M. A. 

vote  to  the  people  of Germany,  and  not  involving  his  general policy  the  Council  ex-
press'd  themselves  as  perfectly  satisfied  -with  this  explanation;  and,  on  the  Motion 
of  Shaw  seconded  by  Yarrow,  It  was  agreed  that  the  explanation  should  be  sent  to 
the  International  Courier  for  publication. 

The  Council  then  adjourned./

Citizen  Maurice  brought  a  letter  from  the  London  Tailors'  Executive  Committee 
which  solicited  the  Council  to  use  their  best  efforts  for  the  purpose  of  obtaining 
money  for  the  Tailors  from  the  Continent  of Europe  and  America.  Jung  said  that 
Dupont  had  spoken  about  the  matter  some  [time]  ago  and  thought  such  action 
should be taken  ||[86]|  but he  (Jung)  had  declined to take  any steps  in the matter be-  15* 
cause  he thought that the  Tailors  seemed  desirous  of doing their own work,  but now 
they had  applied  to  the  Council  he  would  move  "That  the  Secretaries  for  the  Conti 
nent  and  America  write  to  their  Correspondents  for  monetary  aid  for  the  London 
Tailors."  Dupont  seconded  the  motion  which  was  Carried  unanimously. 

Jung  on  behalf of Dupont read  a  letter from Algiers  stating  that Branch  had  been  20j 

formed. 

He  also  read  a  letter  from  Fuveau  near  Marseilles  stating  that  there  were 

300  members  in  the  Branch  there  and  that  they  expected  500  shortly. 

Jung  at  the  request  of  Dupont  again  drew  the  Attention  of  the  Council  to  the 
points  urged  in  Chemale's  letter  which  was  read  last  week,  Viz  the  Advisability  of  25 
sending  Delegates  and  Essays  to  Lausanne  5  days  before  the  Assembling  of Con 
gress.  The  said  Delegates  to  prepare  the  programme  for the  Congress.  In referring to 
the first Article  of the  Bye  Laws  agreed  to  at  the  last  Congress  It  was  found  that  the 
production  of  the  Congressional  programme  was  left  entirely  with  [the]  General 
Council  and  after  some  discussion,  It  was  agreed  on  the  motion  [of]  Citizen  ••30« 
J.Hales,  "That a Committee  of 3  draw  [up]  an Appeal  to the  Societies  in  and  out  of 
Affiliation  inviting  them to  take  part  in  the  Coming  Congress  and  also  that  the  said 

560 

Meeting  of the  General  Council  May  28,  1867 

Committee  draw  up  the  programme  for  the  Congress."  The  appointment  of  the 
Committee  was  postponed  untili  the  next  meeting. | 

I  [87]  I  The  next  point  that  was  urged  by  Jung  was  that  the  Societies  affiliated  to 
tbe  Association  should  be  informed  of Chemale's  desire  Viz  That  any  Societies  or 
members  thereof who  were  about  to  visit  the  French  Exhibition  should  send  word 
to  the  Paris  Administration  so  as  to  enable  them to  give  the  Britons  a  right  hearty 
welcome  on their  arrival.  On  this  subject  a general  instruction was  given to  the  Sec 
retary  to  mention  the  matter  in  his  Correspondence. 

President  Odger  then  stated,  that,  at  a  meeting  of  the  London  Trades  Council 
held  on Friday  Evening  last,  It was  agreed  that  series  of Meetings  should  be  held  in 
London  for  the  purpose  of debating  Labor  Questions,  and  he  invited  the  assistance 
of  the  Council  to  carry  out  that  object.  It  was  proposed,  seconded  and  Carried

letter  was  read  from  the  Peace  Society,  19  New  Broad  Street,  City  which  had  been 
addressed  to  the  President.  It  suggested  the  propriety  of  British  Working  men 
adopting  addresses  expressing  sympathy  with  the  French  and  German  Working 
men.  After  some  discussion  on  the  motion  of  Citizen  Cohn  seconded  by  Citizen 
Dell  it  was  resolved,  "That  the  receipt  of the  Reverend  Henry  Richard's  communi­
cation  be  kindly  acknowledged  and  that  we  ask  for  further  information  concerning

had  appealed  to  the  French-Swiss  Sections  through  the  French-Swiss  organ  of our 
Association,  and  also  to  Becker  on  behalf of the  German  Sections.  Fox  had  done 
nothing  because  he  had  received  no  intimation  on  the  subject  and  the  Secretary 
said  that  the  reason  Fox  had  not  been  acquainted  with  the  matter  was  the  want  of 
his  (Fox's)  address. 

On  the  question  of  appointing  a  Committee  to  draw  up  an  appeal  to  Societies 
and  the  programme  for  the  Congress,  It  was  unanimously  agreed,  That  Citizens

/ [ 9 2 ]/  Council  Meeting  July  2nd 

Cit  J.George  Eccarius  in  the  Chair.  On  account  of the  absence  of the  Secretary  Cit 
Fox  read  the  minutes.  They  were  confirmed  as  read. 

Correspondence. 

Cit  Jung  read  a  letter from  Geneva  complaining  about  the  inactivity  of the  General 
Council  respecting  the  Congress  programme.  It  also  stated  that  the  Peace  Congress 
to  be  held  at  Geneva  was  so  arranged  that  the  delegates  who  would  be  sent  to  Lau 
sanne  could  attend  and  accomplish  a  twofold  mission. 

Vienne.  A letter was read announcing that the branch had sent 60 fr. gift and 40  ft. 
Loan  to  the  Tailors  of London  on  strike.  The  branch  numbered  ||[93]|  600  members 
and  might  have  numbered  1,000  had  it  not  been for the  want  of Carnets.  The  branch 
was likely  to  send two  delegates  to  the Congress.  They had applied  for permission  to 
print  the  rules  but  the  Government  authorities  had  refused.  They  demand  50  Cop 
ies  more  of the  Congress  report.  Citizen  Marcheval  of Vienne  requested  to  be  au 
thorised  to  open  a  branch  at  Annonay,  which  was  unanimously  given. 

I n t e r n a t i o n al  P e n ny  Postage. 

Cit.  Fox  gave  notice  that  on  the  following  Tuesday  he  would  present  his  written 
statement  to  the  Post  Master  General. 

Cit  Fox  complained  that  a  member  of  the  French  branch  Cit.  Besson  had  mis 
conducted  himself at  the  public  meeting  held  under  auspices  of the  German  Arbei 
ter  Bildungsverein  to  commemorate  the  Insurrection  of June  1848.  After  some  con 
versation  the  question  was  adjourned  till  July  9. 

Cit.  Fox  called  attention  to  the  rapid  progress  of productive  cooperative  Associa 

tions  in  America. 

Members  present:  Citizens  Fox,  Law,  Eccarius,  Dupont,  Keller,  Cohn,  Lessner, 

and  Maurice.

Cit.  Jung  in  the  Chair.  Cit  Eccarius  stated  that  he  had  taken  notes  of the  last  meet 
ing  but  had  left  them  at  his  house.  A  letter  was  read  from  Cit.  Shaw  in  which  he 
stated  that  having  not  been  able  to  obtain  employment  in  London  he  could  not 
continue  his  functions  as  General  Secretary.  There  being  no  alternative  his  resigna 
tion  was  accepted  and  on  the  proposition  of Cit.  Marx,  seconded  by  Cit.  Lessner,  a 
vote  of thanks  for  the  services  rendered  by  Cit.  Shaw  while  in  Office,  was  unani 
mously  carried. 

A p p o i n t m e nt  of  a  G e n e r al  Secretary. 

Cit  Fox  proposed,  Cit  Buckley  seconded  that  Cit.  J. George  Eccarius  be  appointed 
Secretary  of the  Association.  Carried  unanimously. 

A  letter was  read  from  Mr. Arthur Miall  requesting  a written  statement  respecting 
the rent due to him.  Cit.  Fox proposed,  Cit. Lessner seconded,  that  ||[94]|  21.  10s. be 
paid  to  Mr. Miall.  Agreed  and  the  Secretary  instructed  to  pay  it. 

Correspondence. 

America.  Cit  Fox  read  letter  from  Mr.  Sylvis,  president  of the  Iron  Moulders'  Un 
ion,  U.S.,  in  answer to  an  appeal on  behalf of the  London Tailors  on  Strike.  Mr. Syl 
vis  stated  that  his  Union  had  done  a  good  deal  in  the  way  of warring  against  the 
Capitalists.  It  had  expended  35,000$.  during  the  past  and  40,000$.  during  the  pres 
ent year  and  had now  2,000  members  out  of work.  It  had  resolved  to  turn  its  atten 
tion  principally  to  establishing  co-operative  foundries  which  was  the  only  effectual 
mode  of dealing  with  the  labour  question.  They  had  several  foundries  in  full  blaze 
and  more  would  be  erected.  Their  funds  were  too  low  to  grant  relief but  he  would 
see what  could  be  done  in  the  shape  of voluntary  contribution.  It  also  contained  in 
formation  about  a  labour  convention  to  be  held  next  month  at  Chicago.  Cit.  Fox 
was  instructed  to  write  to  Mr  Jessup  the  organiser  of the  Convention. 

569 

Minutes  of the  General  Council  of the  I. W. M. A. 

Italy.  Cit  Jung  read  a  letter  from  G. Dassi  in  Naples  complaining  that  his  former 
letters  had  not  been  answered,  and  he  asked  for  the  Rules  of  the  Association.  Cit 
Carter  was  instructed  to  reply. 

France.  Cit  Dupont  announced  that  the  Bronze-workers  of Paris  had  voted  a  gift 
of  10/.  and  a  loan  of the  same  amount  to  the  London  Tailors  on  Strike.  The  Bor 
deaux branch had sent  11.12s.  to  the Tailors  and  11.  8s.  contribution to  the  Council. 
At  Fleurieux-sur-Saône  and  Rouen  public  meetings  were  to  be  held  in  support  of 
the  Tailors. 

Cit.  Dupont  inquired  about  the  publication  of  the  Geneva  Congress  report  in 
Pamphlet  form.  The  secretary  was  instructed  to  invite  Cit.  Collet  to  attend  the 
standing  Committee  on  Saturday  July  13. 

Castelnaudary.  Complaints  were  being  made  about  police  restrictions  but  prom 

ises  made  to  do  the  best  to  organise  the  Association. 

London.  A  letter  was  read  from  the  manager  of  the  Commonwealth  requesting 

payment  for  the  Advertisement.  It  was  agreed  to  discontinue  the  advertisement. 

D e p u t a t i o ns 

Amalgamated  Engineers.  Cit.  Jung  reported  that  Cit.  Odger  had  not  kept  his  ap 
pointment  and  in  consequence  of  that  his  own  presentation  had  been  delayed  to 
such  a  late  hour  that  but  a  very  brief statement  could  be  made  and  the  Council  of 
the  Engineers  had  adjourned  without  a  decision.  The  secretary  was  instructed  [to 
write]  ||[95]|  to  Mr. Allan.  The  secretary  was  also  instructed  to  write  to  the  London 
compositors,  and  the  brass  finishers. 

G e n e r al  Affairs 

Cit  Marx  proposed  and  Cit.  Lafargue  seconded,  that  the  following  be  the  first  Con 
gress  resolution:  On  the  practical  means,  by  which  to  enable  the  International 
Workingmen's  Association  to  fulfil  its  function  of  a  common  centre  of  action  for 
the  working  classes,  female  and  male,  in  their  struggle  tending  to  their  complete 
emancipation  from  the  domination  of  Capital.  Agreed. 

Cit.  Eccarius  read  the  subjoined  address  which  was  unanimously  adopted.  It  was 
further  agreed  that  300  should  be  printed  for  circulation,  and  that  Cit.  Lafargue 
should  render it  in  the  French  language  and  bring  it  before  the  standing  Committee 
on  Saturday  July  13. 

Respecting  Cit.  Besson's  misconduct  it  was  agreed  that  he  should  attend  the 
standing  Committee  July  13,  and  the  secretary  was  instructed  to  write  to  him.  Cit. 
Fox  brought  his  written  statement  to  the  Post  Master  General  before  the  Council. 
Cit.  Eccarius,  Jung,  and  Carter,  all  of whom  waited  on  the  Postmaster  of  Switzer 
land,  suggested  some  additions  which  Cit.  Fox  readily  accepted  and  stated  that  he 
would  complete  the  document  in  the  course  of  the  week.  The  meeting  then  ad 
journed.

|[96]|  Address  of  the  G e n e r al  Council 
of  the  I n t e r n a t i o n al  W o r k i ng  M e n 's  Association. 

To  the  Members  and  affiliated  Societies. 
"Fellow  Working  Men,—According  to  the  reports  we  have  received  from  time  to 
time—our  continental  members  are  very  persevering  in  propagating  the  principles 
and  extending  the  ramifications  of  our  Association,  particularly  in  Switzerland, 
where  most  of our  branches  are  actively  engaged  in  establishing  benefit  and  credit 
funds,  and  co-operative  societies  of  production  in  connection  with  our  Associa 
tion—the  progress  of the  British  section  has  been  greatly  interfered  with by  the  Re 
form  movement.  As  the  council  looks  upon  the  political  enfranchisement  of  the 
working  classes  as  a  means  to  complete  their  social  emancipation,  it  was  but  natu 
ral that  the  British  members  should  take  a  leading part  in  the Reform  agitation  and 
that our  affiliated  societies  should,  for  the  time  being,  throw  their  whole  weight  into 
the balance  against reactionary  phrase-mongers  and  malignant  obstructives  to bring 
matters to  a crisis.  However,  now that the heat of the  agitation has  subsided,  that no 
more  monster  demonstrations  have  to  be  organised,  and  the  time  appointed  for  the 
meeting  of  the  second  annual  congress  is  drawing  near,  it  is  high  time  that  those 
who  have  absented  themselves  during  the  height  of the  contest  should  resume  their 
seats  at  the  Council  board,  and  our  affiliated  branches  should  make  an  effort  to 
lend us  a helping hand.  The  aims  of our Association  are  not  ephemeral;  our labours 
will  continue  to  absorb  the  attention  of the  working  population  until  wages-slavery 
has  become  a  matter  of history.  What  the  lot  of the  labouring  population  would  be 
if  everything  were  left  to  isolated,  individual  bargaining,  may  be  easily  foreseen. 
The  iron  rule  of supply  and  demand,  if left  unchecked,  would  speedily  reduce  the 
producers  of all  the  wealth  to  a  starvation  level,  since  in  the  actual  condition  of so 
ciety  every  improvement of the  productive  powers,  every  abridgement of manual la 
bour,  tends  but  to  lower  wages  and  increase  the  hours  of toil.  Surely  the  labouring 
poor,  the  producers  of all wealth,  have  a human,  an  inherent,  a natural claim to par 
ticipate  in  the  fruits  of their  own  toil,  but  this  claim  can  only  be  enforced  and  real 
ized by the union of all.  Sectional  efforts are of little  avail,  and  partial successes  are 
but  short-lived.  Nothing  short  of  a  thorough  union  and  combination  of  the  work 
people  of all  countries  can  achieve  the  satisfactory  solution  of the  labour  question. 
Much  has  already  been  done  in  that  direction,  but  more  remains  to  be  done.  The 
periodical  meeting  of the  representative  men  of  the  different  countries  has  the  ef 
fect  of  removing  time-honoured  national  antipathies,  cementing  friendship,  and 
smoothing  the  path  for  a  common  mode  of  action  towards  a  common  end.  We 
therefore  appeal  to  you,  to  do  what  is  in  your power to  send  as  many representatives 
of  the  British  branches  as  possible  to  the  ensuing  congress  of  our  Association, 
which  will  assemble  on  Monday,  Sept. 2nd,  1867,  at  Lausanne. 

According  to  the  regulations  passed  at  the  first  annual  congress,  every  branch  is 

571 

Minutes of the  General  Council  of the  I. W. M. A. 

entitled  to  send  a  delegate.  Branches  numbering  above  500  members  may  send  a 
delegate  for  every  full  500  members.  Branches  that  do  not  consider  it  advisable  to 
send  delegates  of their  own  may  contribute  towards  the  expense  of delegates  repre 
senting  groups  of branches. 

The  principal  questions  to  be  settled  by  the  congress  are:— 
1. On  the  practical  means  by  which  to  enable  the  International  Working-men's 
Association  to  fulfil  its  function  of  a  common  centre  of  action  for  the  working-
classes,  female  and  male,  in  their  struggle  tending  to  their  complete  emancipation 
from  the  domination  of capital. 

2. How  can  the  working-classes  utilise  for  the  purpose  of their  own  emancipation 

the  credit  which  they  now  give  to  the  middle-classes  and  the  government. 

An  early  reply  stating  your  decision  is  requested. 

By  order  of the  Council, 

George Odger, President.

Citizen  Jung  in  the  Chair.  The  minutes  of the  two  previous  meetings were  read  and 
confirmed. 

G e n e r al  Report. 

5  The general  secretary reported  that he  received  a  letter from  John  Kane  secretary  of 
National  Association  of  Malleable  Iron  workers  announcing  the  intention  of  that 
•  body  to join.  The  secretary  of the  Engineers had  sent rather an  evasive  answer,  and 
promised  to  lay  the  case  before  the  general  Council  of the  Engineers.  The  secretary 
of the  London  Trades  Council  asked  for  a  deputation  to  attend  the  annual meeting 

10  of that body. 

Correspondence. 

Switzerland.  The  people  of Geneva  identify  the  Sheffield  outrages  and  Trades  Un 
ions with  the  International Association.  The  section  desired  a  refutation but  as  the 
Geneva  papers  had  only  reproduced  extracts  from  the  British  Journals,  it  was 
15  agreed  not  [to]  do  anything  in  the  matter.  Extracts  from  a  leading  article  in  the 
Voix  de  l'Avenir were  read  pointing  out  the  fact  that  Maximilian,  the  imperial  in 
vader  of  Mexico,  had  proclaimed  sentence  of  death,  which  had  been  executed 
-  within  24  hours  of  its  promulgation,  against  every  Mexican  that  had  been  found 
fighting  for  his  own  country  against  a foreign  intruder;  and  the  official press  of Eu-
' 
20  rope,  in  the  face  of such  facts,  dared  to  extenuate  his  monstrous  Crimes. 

France.  The  French  secretary  handed  over  21.  as  part  of the  annual  contribution 
of  the  Lyons  Branch.  The  Lyons  branch  asked  to  be  authorised  to  form  a  central 
; 
committee  for the  Rhône  département which was unanimously  granted.  The  mem-
bers  of the  Lyons  Branch were very  hard  up  and might  only  be  able  to  send  one  del-
! 
25  egate  to  the  Congress.  To  be  able  to  hold  periodical  meetings  they  had  resolved  to 
register  themselves  as  a  co-operative  Association  but  were  not  silly  enough  to  be-

lieve  that  their  savings  would  emancipate  them  from  the  domination  of  Capital. 
They  had  prepared  a  form  of cards  and  a  project  of Rules  that  would  be  in  harmony 
with  the  laws.  A new Branch  had  been  established  at Villefranche,  Cit.  Chassin  Sec 
retary  which  would  send  a  delegate  to  Lausanne.  Another  had  been  established  at 
Castelnaudary.  Schettel  had  received  all  the  numbers  of the  Courrier,  [they]  would 
gladly  |[[98]|  subscribe  but were too  poor.  The Voix  de  l'Avenir was  their organ  [but 
they]  were  rather  more  radical  than  it. 

G e n e r al  Business 

Report  of standing  committee.  Cit.  Besson justified  his  conduct  1,  by  asserting that 
in  French  meetings  one  man  could  surrender  his  place  to  another,  2,  that  he  had 
not understood the  Chairman;  3,  that he  did not consider  it  a fault to  raise  a  discus 
sion;  4,  that  he  owned  he  had  been  much  excited. 

Cit.  Fox  on  bringing  up  the  Report  objected  to  various  points  and  gave  notice  of 
motion  to  take  it  into  consideration  at  a  future  opportunity.  The  written  statement 
to  the  Postmaster General was  agreed to  and  it was  resolved  that  it  should  be  signed 
by  all  the  secretaries. 

Cit.  Marx,  Cohn,  Fox,  Dupont  and  Eccarius  were  appointed  as  the  deputation to 
attend  the  annual  meeting  of  the  London  Trades  Council,  on  Thursday  July  25, 
1867,  Bell  Inn,  Old  Bailey. 

It was  agreed that the  congress programme  should be  discussed during the month 

of  August.

[Auszug  aus  The  Commonwealth] 

The  Commonwealth: 
Nr. 226, 20. Juli 1867 

A letter from the  tailors  of Berlin was  read,  stating that the  cigarmakers  had raised a 
levy,  and  some  cabinetmakers  had joined  to  get  money  for  the  London  tailors.  The 
proceeds  of  a  concert,  together  with  the  subscriptions,  amount  in  all  to  221.,  for 
which  a  cheque  was  received.  The  following  extract  from  the  appeals  published  in 
the  Berlin  papers  was  read: — 

"The  council  of  the  International  Working-men's  Association  has  appealed  to, 

the  Berlin tailors  for pecuniary  aid.  The  case  of the London  tailors  is not  a matter of 
charity,  it  is  a  matter  of  duty.  They  have  conscientiously  entered  upon  a  giant 
struggle  against  capital,  well  knowing  that  if they  are  defeated  theirs  will  be  a  sorry 
lot  for  years  to  come,  and  it  will  re-act  upon  the  whole  labouring  population,  at : 
least  in  England,  since  it  is  not  simply  a  contest  between  operative  and  master  tai 
lors,  but  a  struggle  of labour  against  the  domination  of  capital.  May  the  working- J

men  of  Berlin  show  that  they  understand  the  importance  of  the  solidarity  of  the 
working-men  as  well  as  their  English  compeers,  who  prove  it  by  their  continuous 
contributions.  The working-men's  interests  are  everywhere  the  same."  The  secretary 
for  Switzerland  reported  that  the  Romain  section  of  Geneva  had  sent  149  francs, 
;  and  the  German  section  100  francs  for the  London  tailors.  The  secretary  for France 
announced  the  establishment  of new  branches  at  Villefranche  and  Castelnaudary. 
The  Lyonnese  sent  part  of  their  annual  contribution,  and  stated,  in  a  letter,  that 
they very  much  deplored  their fate  in  not being  able  to  render  any  pecuniary  assist 
ance  to  those  heroic  champions  of  labour—the  London  tailors—in  then  giant 
struggle  against the  domination of the  capitalists.  They state  that  the  silk trade  is  in 
such  a  bad  state,  and  employment  so  scarce,  that  many  workmen  are  literally  in 
rags.  To  evade  the  police  restrictions  on  public  meetings  the  Lyons  branch has  con 
stituted  itself a  Co-operative  Association  under  which  title  periodical  meetings  are 
lawful.  An  extensive  lock-out  in  the  stuff printing  trade  was  also  reported.  The  firm 
i  of Zautmann,  at Puteaux,  discharged  four workmen for being  members  of a mutual 
credit  society.  When  their  fellow  labourers  in  the  factory  became  aware  of the  rea 
son  of the  discharge,  they  with  one  accord  demanded  the  return  of the  discharged. 
:  Upon  this  being  refused  they  struck  work,  and  the  proprietors  of the  stuff-printing 
establishments  of Paris,  Puteaux,  Saint-Denis,  Sevres,  Saint  Germain,  and  Le  Pecq, 
.20  with  the  exception  of the  house  of Malsis  and  Chaquel,  have  their  workpeople  out, 
and  declared  that  they  will  not  re-open  until  Zautmann's  people,  minus  the  four, 
resume  work.

Citizen  Jung  in  the  Chair. 

The  minutes  of the  previous  meeting  were  read  and  confirmed. 
The  General  Secretary  reported  that  he  had  received  a  letter  from  Mr.  Dodshon 
the  Secretary  of the  Amalgamated  Cordwainers,  [stating]  that  the  rale  which  [en 
abled]  his  executive  to  grant  5/.  towards  the  Congress  fund  last  year  had  been  re 
scinded  by  the  Conference  of  1867.  The  Amalgamation  had  never  affiliated  itself, 
which  had  been  stated  on  one  occasion  to  a  deputation.  The  Secretary  asked  leave 
to  write  to  the  London  Working  Men's  Association  which  was  agreed  after  some 
discussion. 

Correspondence 

America.  Cit.  Marx  had  received  letters,  one  from  New  York  announcing  the  affil 
iation  of the  Communist  Club,  which  rejects  all  revealed  religion,  [|[99]|  and  every 
[doctrine]  not founded  upon  the perception of concrete  objects.  It advocates  the  de 
struction  of  individual  property,  the  equality  of  all  persons  and  its  members  bind 
each  other to  carry  these  maxims  into  practice.  The  other  letter was  from  a  kindred 
Association  at  Hoboken,  N.  J.,  also  announcing  its  adhesion.  It  called  upon  the 
council  to  send  documents,  and  spoke  of the  great  danger  there  was  of the  working 
men  of America  being  traduced  by  the  professional  politicians,—the  greatest  ras 
cals  under  the  sun  who  were  advocating  working  men's  measures  to  retain  their 
places.  Senator  Wade  had  made  an  almost  Communistic  Speech  the  other  day  but 
had  explained  it  away  before  a  bourgeois  audience. 

Citizen  Marx  called  the  attention  of the  Council  to  a  Parliamentary  Blue  book, 
"Reports  by  Her  Majesty's  Secretaries  of  Embassy  and  Legation  on  the  manufac 
tures  and  commerce  of the  countries  in  which  they  reside,  1867,"  of which  the  fol 
lowing  is  an  extract:—During  the  first  eleven  months  of 1864  the  imports  into  Bel 
gium  of  raw  cast  hon  were  7,200  tons,  of  which  5,300  were  British;  in  the 
corresponding  period  of  1865  they  rose  to  18,800  tons,  of which  17,000  tons  were 
British;  and  in  1866  they rose  to 29,590  tons,  of which 26,200  tons  were  British.  On

1864  amounted to  24,400  tons,  17,200  tons  of which went  to  France,  and  5,900  tons 
to  England;  whereas  in  the  corresponding  period  of  1866  they  did  not  amount  to 
more  than  14,000  tons,  of  which  9,600  tons  were  exported  to  France,  and  only 
5  241  tons  to  Great  Britain.  The  exports  of  Belgian  rails  have  also  fallen  from 

75,353  tons,  during  the  first  eleven  months  of 1864,  to  62,734  tons  in  1866. 

The  following  is  an  exact  statement,  in  a  tabular  form,  of the  quantities  of iron 
and steel of all sorts  imported  into  Belgium  from  Great  Britain,  and  of Belgian  iron 
and  steel  exported  to  Great Britain  during  the  first  eleven  months  of 1866,  as  com-

The  results  may  be  briefly  stated  thus:—whereas  in  1864  (taking  the  first  eleven 
months of the year)  Belgium supplied England with 20,979  tons  of iron  and  steel,  in 
35  1866  she  only  sent  8,817  tons,  whilst  the  exports  of British  iron  and  steel  to  Bel 

gium  rose  from  8,528  tons  in  1864  to  31,289  tons  in  1866. 

It  would  be  recollected  that  some  of  the  middle  class  newspapers  had  last  year 
raised  an  outcry  about  the  pernicious  effects  of the  Trades'  Unions,  that  their  do 
ings were  driving the  iron  trade  from this  country  into  the  hands  of the  Belgian  iron 
40  masters. None  of the papers that had raised that outcry had even mentioned the  ap 

pearance  of this  Blue  book  much  less  stated  its  contents. 

After  the  transaction  of  some  routine  business  the  Council  adjourned  to  Tues 

day,  July  30,  16,  Castle-street,  East,  W. 

Switzerland.  The  Geneva  section  had  adhered  to  the  programme  of  the  peace

Minutes of the General  Council  of the  I. W. M. A. 

congress.  The  Radical  Bourgeois  Committee  of Fleurieux  called  upon  the  Radical 
Bourgeois  Committee  of La  Chaux-de-Fonds  to  fight  against the  Social  Democratic 
tendencies  of the  International,  which tended  to  overthrow  social  order  and  caused 
hatred  between  different  classes.  The  watchmakers  were  availing  themselves  of the 
International  Organisation  to  put  a  stop  to  [a]  system  by  which  the  capitalists  paid 
their  workmen  at  long  intervals,  and  charged  discount  if the  workmen  drew money 
on  account. | 

|[100]|  Italy.  Cit.  Carter  stated  that  he  [had]  written  as  directed  but  that  he  had 

only  sent  the  first  four  numbers  of the  Courrier  containing  the  Congress  reports. 

Cit.  Eccarius  nominated  Cit.  Neal president of the  City  Branch of the Tailors' As 

sociation  to  become  a  member  of the  Council. 

Cit  Fox  announced  that  he  had  received  an  appeal  of the  Labour  Congress  Com 

mittee  in  America. 

Cit.  Marx  proposed  Lessner  seconded  "that  our  Congress  programme  be  pub 
lished  in  the  Courrier  Français;  that  no  branch  has  a  right  to  put  forth  a  pro 
gramme  of its  own,  that  the  council  alone  is  empowered  to  draw  up  the  Congress 
programme  and  that  the  General  Secretary  be  instructed  to  send  the  council  pro 
gramme  to  the  Courrier  and  communicate  the  foregoing  resolution  to  the  Paris 
Committee."  Agreed. 

Agreed  that  the  balance  sheet  to  September  1867  be  appended  to  the  Congress 

report. 

Cit.  Fox  was  commissioned  to  enquire  about  a  room  in  Cleveland  Hall.  Agreed 
that branches  that wanted  the  Congress  report  in Pamphlet Form should  send  an  in 
stalment  of  the  money. 

Cit.  F[ox]  announced  that  a  Social  Science  Association  had  been  formed  in 

America.

Cit.  Carter  in  the  Chair. 

The  minutes  of the  previous  meeting  were  read  and  confirmed. 
The  General  Secretary  reported  that  Alfred  A. Walton  had  written  that  he  was 
prevented  going  as  a  delegate  by  the  publication  of his  book  Our  Future  Progress. 
He  sent  five  shillings  to  the  Congress  fund.  The  Coventry  Ribbon  Weavers  had 
inquired  about  the  particulars  of going  to  Switzerland  with  a view  of sending  a  spe 
cial  delegate.  Mr.  Kane  the  Secretary  of the  Malleable  Iron  workers,  was  going  to 
try  what  he  )|[101]|  could  do  for  the  Congress  fund.  The  Coach  Trimmers,  The 
Globe,  will  consider  the  question  about  the  Congress  fund.  The  Curriers'  Society 
had  consented  to  entertain  a  deputation  on  August  1.  The  Eintracht,  a  German 
Club  in  Whitechapel,  had  voted  10s.  to  the  Congress  fund,  and  the  Tailors  of Bre 
men had sent  41.10s.  for the  Tailors  on  Strike.  The Polish  branch  announced  by let 
ter  that  it  would  appoint  a  Polish  Exile  resident  in  Switzerland  as  delegate  to  Con 
gress  and  contribute  according  to  its  means  to  the  Congress  fund.  It  [would]  send 
two  years'  contribution. 

Cit.  Neal  was  unanimously  elected  as  a  member  of the  Council. 

Correspondence 

France.  Cit.  Vasseur,  the  Marseilles  Correspondent,  wrote  from  Fuveau  a  coal-min 
ing  village  about  30  Kilometres  from  Marseilles,  that  the  Capitalists  of that  place 
were  doing  all  in  their  power  to  turn  the  miners,  about  500  in  number,  against  the 
International Association.  He  and  a  few friends  did  all  they  could  on  the  other  side 
and  he  should  not  leave  before  establishing  a  branch.  Tolain  had  placed  the  Cour 
rier Français  at  his  disposal,  which was  a great  assistance.  He  asked  the  French  sec 
retary  to  write  an  encouraging  letter  to  Marseilles  to  keep  the  spirits  of the  mem 
bers up. 

Cit  Talbot  of Caen  announced  in  his  letter  that  Longuet  was  with  him;  that  his 
branch would  send  a  delegate  to  Lausanne,  and  that he  would  send  a guinea for the 
Council.

Minutes of the General  Council  of the  I. W. M. A. 

A  letter was  read  from  Eugene  Benière,  of Neuville  sur  Saône  announcing  that a 
delegate  would  be  sent  to  Lausanne,  and  that  the  branch  was  in favour  of the  peace 
congress. 

Report  of  D e p u t a t i o n s. 

Cit.  Fox  had  made  inquiries  about  the  Cleveland  Coffee-Room.  It  was  only  free 
Wednesdays,  and  could  be  had  for  half  a  crown  a  week.  Cit  Cohn  objected  as 
Wednesday  meetings  would  be  tantamount  to  his  exclusion,  because  the  commit 
tee  of his  society  met  that  night.  The  question  was  adjourned. 

Cit.  Cohn  gave  a  report  of  the  proceedings  of  the  London  Trades  Council  who 
had  [taken]  up  the  entire  evening  with  a  quarrel  between  the  Council  and  some 
branches  of  the  Amalgamated  Carpenters.  The  meeting  stood  adjourned  to  Au 
gust  3,  and  he  volunteered  to  attend  again.  Cit.  Hales  was  appointed  to  accompany 
him. 

Citizens  Hales  and  Eccarius  were  appointed  to  attend  the  Curriers'  delegate  | 

|[102](  meeting  on  August  1. 

Cit.  Marx  gave  notice  of motion  that  the  peace  programme  be  taken  into  consid 

eration  on  the  6lh  of August. 

Cit.  Carter  gave  notice  that  at  the  next  Council  [meeting],  he  should  move  that 
4  delegates  to  the  Congress  be  appointed.  The  Council  then  adjourned  to  Tuesday 
August  6. 

Members  present Buckley,  Carter,  Cohn,  Dupont,  Eccarius,  Fox,  Gardner,  Hales, 

Keller,  Lessner,  Marx,  Maurice,  Shaw,  Zabicki.

/[102]/  Council  Meeting  August  6. 

Cit.  Jung  in  the  Chair.  The  minutes  of  the  previous  meeting  were  read  and  con 
firmed. 

The  General  Secretary  reported  that  Citizen  Howell  had  sent  2s.  6d.  to  the  Con-
5  gress  fund  and  applied for  a  letter of introduction  to  the  Paris members.  The Board 
of management  of the  Coventry  Ribbon  Weavers  had  referred  the  subject  of send 
ing  a  delegate  to  the  Congress  to  a  meeting  of Trade  delegates  which  would  take 
place  in  a  few  days.  The  Alliance  Cabinet  Makers  had  written  that  the  pressure 
upon  their  funds  had  been  so  great  that  it  was  impossible  to  grant  anything  for  the 
10  Congress.  The  Organ  Builders  had  sent  their  annual  subscription  2s.  Id.  but  could 
not give  anything  towards  the  expenses  of the  Congress.  The  Arbeiter Bildungs  Ver 
ein  was  going  to  hold  a  summoned  meeting  to  see  what  could  be  done  about  the 
Congress.  The  Executive  of the Amalgamated  Carpenters  and  Joiners  had  agreed  to 
an  annual  contribution  of £2  leaving  it  optional  for  the  branches  to  affiliate  them 
's  selves  separately.  The  delegates  meeting  of the  Curriers'  Society  had  received  the 
Deputation  favourably,  but  according  to  a  letter  of  the  Secretary  the  Question 
would  have  to  be  submitted  to  the  members  for  decision. 

Correspondence.  | 

20 

|[103]|  France.  A  letter  was  read  from  Cit.  Toutain,  Condé  (Calvados),  stating  that 
there  were  only  4  members  left;  that  they  had  sent  5 fr.  to  Cit.  Fribourg,  and  that 
[they]  would  unite  with  the  Caen  Branch  to  send  a  delegate.  Cit.  Marcheval  wrote 
from  Vienne  (Isère)  that  the  Question  of  sending  a  delegate  was  being  discussed. 
He stated  that  he wanted  some  Congress  reports.  He  wanted  to  go  to  Annonay  and 
required  to  show  something.  A  letter  from  Cit  Suire  at  Nantes  announced  that  the 
25  Congress  reports  as  well  [as]  the  Address  and  invitation  to  the  next  Congress  had 
been  received.  Many  of the  former  members  had  not  renewed  their  annual  contri 
butions  fearing  that  as  the  Association  was  political  it might get them  into  trouble. 
It  was  very  difficult  to  make  propaganda  at  Nantes.  There  were  many  benefit  and 
charitable  institutions  and  the  people  were  on  the  whole  very  religious.  Any  one 

583 

Minutes of the General  Council  of the  I. W. M. A. 

who  asked  for  money  to  accomplish  any  thing  was  looked  upon  as  a  rogue.  The 
writer  had  been  disparaged  by  people  who  had  formerly  been  his  associates.  Cit. 
Dupont  stated that with much trouble  he  had  succeeded  to  get  the  Congress  address 
and  programme  published  in  the  Courrier  de  l'Europe.  He  also  received  an  invita 
tion  for  the  Council  to  send  a  delegate  to  the  co-operative  Congress  to  be  held  at 
Paris  on  the  16t h,  17t h,  and  18th  of the  present  month. 

Cit.  Fox  announced  that  he  had  received  an  Address  from  the  Labour  Congress 
Committee,  U.S.,  and  that  by  this  he  had  discovered  that  the  Address  he  formerly 
had  was  wrong.  The  Chicago  Workingman's  Advocate  had  published  several  parts 
of our Congress  reports  and  stated  in  [an]  article  on  the  ensuing  labour  Congress  in 
America  that  one  of the  Questions  to  be  decided  was  the  advisability  of sending  a 
delegate  to  the  International  Congress  in  Europe,  to  prevent  the  inundations  of 
Workpeople  brought  over  by  the  Capitalists  from  Europe  to  depreciate  the  value  of 
labour,  and  to  bring  about  an  understanding  between  the  working  people  of the  two 
Continents. 

D e p u t a t i o n s. 

Cit.  Hales  stated  that  he  had  attended  with  Cit.  Cohn  at  ||[104]|  the  London  Trades 
Council  but  that  the  other  business  had  taken  up  the  whole  evening  and  the  ques 
tion  of  the  Congress  had  not  come  on  for  discussion.  There  would  be  no  other 
meeting  before  the  Congress. 

Citizens  Hales  and  Jung  were  appointed  to  attend  the  Brass  Finishers'  meeting 

next  Monday. 

Cit.  Carter proposed  Cit Yarrow  seconded  that  Cit.  Howell  be  asked  to  attend  the 
Cooperative  Congress  at  Paris  as  delegate  of  the  Council  and  Cit  Dupont  furnish 
him  with  credentials.  Unanimously  agreed. 

The  question  about  the  Cleveland  Coffee-room  was  again  adjourned,  Mrs  Law 

volunteered  to  make  inquiries  whether  it  could  not  be  had  on  Tuesdays.  Cit.  Mau 
rice  was  instructed  to  inquire  about  the  Franklin  Hall. 

Cit.  Carter  proposed  that  four  delegates  be  appointed  and  that  whatever  money 
might  come  in  should  be  equally  divided  amongst them  and  that they  should be re 
quested  to  advance  the  remainder.  After  some  discussion  the  motion  was  with 
drawn. 

Citizen  Hales  then  proposed  and  Cit.  Lessner  seconded,  that  the  money  be  given 
to  the  delegates  according  to  the  number  of votes,  that  is  he  who  had  the  highest 
number  of votes  should  receive  the  first  £10  and  so  in  rotation  as  far  as  the  money 
that might  come  in would reach.  This  resolution was  carried by 7  against 5  votes. It 
was  then  agreed  that  four  delegates  be  appointed;  that  the  nomination  should  be 
proceeded  with  at  once  and  the  ballot  take  place  on  Tuesday  August  13.  Citizens 
Jung,  Odger,  and  Shaw  declined  to be nominated.  The  following were  nominated  as 
candidates:  Cit.  Carter,  Dupont,  Eccarius,  Fox,  Law,  and  Marx. 

The  meeting  then  adjourned  to  August  13. |

The  ordinary  weekly  council  meeting  was  held  last  Tuesday  evening,  August  13. 
Citizen  Jung  in  the  chair.  The  minutes  of the  previous  meeting  were  read  and  con 
firmed. 

The  General  Secretary  reported  that he  had  received  notice  that  the  two  societies 
of basket-makers were  going  to  have  a  special  meeting,  when  the  question  concern 
ing  the  delegate  to  the  International  Congress  would  be  decided.  The  Chelsea 
branch  of the  Amalgamated  Carpenters  and  Joiners  had  passed  a  resolution  urging 
upon  the  Executive  Council  of that Association  the  necessity  of taking  the  votes  of 
all  the  members  for  or  against  affiliating  the  entire  body  to  the  International  Asso 
ciation.  The  Executive  of the Amalgamated  Tailors'  Association  had  agreed  to  pro 
pose  the  affiliation  of that  Association  as  a  substantial  resolution  at  the  next  con 
ference;  they  were  not  permitted  by  their  rules  to  grant  any  assistance  to  the 
Congress  fund.  The  French  branch  had  appointed  Citizen  Dupont  as  special  del 
egate  to  the  Congress,  and  the  Arbeiter  Bildungs  Verein  would  appoint  a  special 
delegate  in  the  course  of  the  ensuing  week.  The  Berlin  cigar  makers  had  sent 
25  thalers  for  the  tailors  on  strike. 

Citizen  Hales  announced  that  the  Elastic Web  Weavers'  Association  had  granted 

£1  to  the  Congress  Fund. 

It  was  then  agreed  that  the  balloting  should  be  proceeded  with. 
Citizen  Marx  stated  that  he  was  not  in  a  position  to  go  to  the  Congress  this  year, 

and  must  therefore  withdraw. 

As  Citizen  Dupont  was  already  appointed  by  the  French  branch,  the  ballot  sim 
ply turned  upon which  of the  proposed  delegates  should  have  the  preference  in  case 
the  means  should  prove  insufficient  to  send  the  four.  While  the  balloting  was  going 
on, 

Citizen  Marx  called  attention  to  the  Peace  Congress  to  be  held  at  Geneva.  He 
said  it was  desirable  that  as  many  delegates  as  could  make  it  convenient  should  at 
tend  the  Peace  Congress  in  their  individual  capacity;  but  that  it  would  be  injudi 
cious  to  take  part  officially  as  representatives  of the  International  Association.  The 
International Working  Men's  Congress  was  in  itself a  Peace  Congress,  as  the  union 
of the  working  classes  of the  different  countries  must  ultimately  make  international 

585 

Minutes of the General  Council  of the  I. W. M. A. 

wars  impossible.  If the  promoters  of the  Geneva  Peace  Congress  really  understood 
the  question  at  issue  they  ought  to  have  joined  the  International  Association.  The 
present  increase  of the  large  armies  in  Europe  had  been  brought  about  by  the  revo 
lution  of  1848;  large  standing  armies  were  the  necessary  result  of the  present  state 
of society.  They  were  not  kept  up  for  international  warfare,  but  to  keep  down  the 
working  classes.  However,  as  there  were  not  always  barricades  to  bombard,  and 
working  men  to  shoot,  there  was  sometimes  a  possibility  of international  quarrels 
being fomented  to keep  the  soldiery  in  trim.  The  peace-at-any-price party would  no 
doubt  muster  strong  at  the  Congress.  That  party  would  fain  leave  Russia  alone  in 
the  possession  of the means  to  make  war upon the  rest of Europe,  while  the  very  ex 
istence  of  such  a  power  as  Russia  was  enough  for  all  the  other  countries  to  keep 
their  armies  intact.  It  was  more  than  probable  that  some  of  the  French  Radicals 
would  avail  themselves  of  the  opportunity  to  make  declamatory  speeches  against 
their own  Government,  but such would have  more  effect  if delivered  at  Paris.  Those 
who  declined  putting  their  shoulders  to  the  wheel  to  bring  about  a  transformation 
in the  relations  of labour  and  capital  ignored  the very  conditions  of universal peace. 
He  ended  by  proposing  "That  the  delegates  of the  Council  be  instructed  not  to  take 
any  official  part  in  the  Peace  Congress,  and  to  resist  any  motion  that  might  be 
brought  forward  at  the  Working  Men's Congress  tending  to  take  an  official  part." 

Citizen  Keller  stated  that  the  delegate  of the  French  Branch  had  already  received 

instructions  to  that  effect. 

After  some  observations  by  Citizens  Fox  and  Eccarius  the  resolution  was  unan 

imously  agreed  to. 

The  result  of  the  ballot  was:—Citizens  George  Eccarius,  1st;  Peter  Fox,  2nd; 

James  Carter,  3rd;  Mrs.  Law,  4th. 

On  the  motion  of Mrs. Law  it was  agreed  that the  next  meeting,  on  Tuesday,  Au 
gust  20t h,  be  held  at  the  Cleveland  Hall  Coffee-room.  The  subjects  to  be  discussed 
are,  the  annual  report  and  the  Congress  programme. 

The  meeting  then  adjourned. |

The General Council met on Tuesday  last,  August 20,  in the  Cleveland Hall Coffee-
Room,  where  the  regular Tuesday  night's  meetings will  be  held  in future.  There was 
a muster  of members  who  have  lately  devoted  their  energies  entirely  to  the  Reform 
5  movement,  now  that  the  Bill  has  become  law  they  will  resume  their  seats  at  the 
Council  Board.  Citizen  Jung  occupied  the  chair.  The  minutes  of the  previous  meet 
ing  were  read  and  confirmed. 

The  General  Secretary reported  that  the London  cigar-makers had voted £1  Is.  to 
the  Congress  fund,  and  the  West-end  ladies'  boot-makers  £5.  The  Coventry  ribbon 
10  weavers  had  appointed  a  special  delegate,  and  Citizen Alfred  A.Walton,  of Brecon, 
had  announced  his  intention  of representing  the  National  Reform League,  of which 
he  is  the  President. 

The  Swiss  secretary  announced  the  formation  of  a  branch  at  Berne. 
The  French  secretary  read  a  letter  from  the  miners  of Fuveau,  who  have  estab-
lished  a  branch.  He  also  announced  that  the  rules  of  the  association  had  been 
printed  in  Algiers.

The  secretary  for  America  read  a  letter  from  Mr.  Wm.  J. Jessup,  vice-president 
and  orderly  officer  of  the  National  Labour  Union  for  the  state  of  New  York,  of 
which  the  following  is  an  extract: —"It  gives  me  the  greatest  pleasure  to  acknowl-
20  edge  your welcome  letter and  accompanying  papers,  for which  favour please  accept 
my  most  sincere  thanks.  I have  long  desired  to  open  correspondence  with  the  work 
ing-men  of England,  and have written two  or three  letters with that  end in view.  The 
corresponding  secretary  of the National Labour Union  is very  dilatory  in  answering. 
As  an  officer  of the  National  Labour Union  I  exceedingly  regret  that  your  kindness 
in furnishing report  and  information relating to  the  Geneva  Congress,  has  not been 
reciprocated  on  the  part  of our  corresponding  secretary,  as  I  hold  it  as  a  matter  of 
great  importance  that  the  working  men  of  both  the  old  and  the  new  countries 
should  be  in  close  communication  in  relation  to  the  labour  movement,  as  I  believe 
it  will  prove  of mutual  benefit  to  all.  I  much  regret  that  the  day  will  be  too  far  ad-
30  vanced when  our national body  meets to take  action upon  sending a  delegate to the 
Congress  at  Lausanne.  I  would  much  like  to  see  the  working  men  of  the  United 
States  represented  therein.  I  shall  take  much  pleasure  in  complying  with  your  re-

Minutes  of the General  Council  of the  I. W. M. A. 

quest  to  inform  the  Chicago  Congress  of the  assembling  of your  Congress  on  Sep 
tember  2nd.  I  shall  also  take  the  liberty  in  making  my  report  to  that  body  to  read 
your letter,  believing  it  of sufficient  importance  to  make  it public.  I  desire  to  assure 
your General  Council  that,  having  been  elected  delegate  to  Chicago  from the Work 
ing  Men's  Union  of this  city,  I  will  immediately  on  my  return  write  them  full  infor 
mation  as  to  the  action taken  by  the  union,  and  will forward  such papers  as  contain 
the  fullest  account  of the  proceedings.  My  official term  as  vice  president will termi 
nate  with  the  sitting  of the  union.  I  would  like  to  maintain  our  correspondence  in 
my  other  official  position  as  President  of the  New  York  State  Working  Men's  As 
sembly,  or  Corresponding  Secretary  of  the  New  York  Working  Men's  Union,  and 
will  be  at  all  times  happy  to  exchange  documents  relating  to  the  labour  question.  I 
recognize  the  necessity  of  frequent  intercourse  between  our  two  bodies,  and  if  I 
hold  an  official position  therein  another year,  I  will  do  all  in  my  power  to  maintain 
such  intercourse,  and  will  willingly  furnish  any  information  in  my  power  that  you 
or  the  General  Council  may  desire,  or  exchange  papers  or  documents  of  interest. 
Many  of the  trades  of San  Francisco  are  on  strike  against  an  increase  of hours  of la 
bour,  having  been  employed  on  the  eight  hours'  system  the  past  nineteen  months." 

The  General  Secretary  then  read  his  draft  of the  third  annual  report  of the  Asso 
ciation,  which,  with  an  additional paragraph  about  the  action  taken  by  the  Council 
respecting  international  penny  postage,  and  some  verbal  amendments,  was  agreed 
to.  It  appears  from  this  report  that  the  British  section  of the  Association  has  been 
increased  by  the  affiliation  of ten  organised  bodies.  In  France,  seven  new  branches 
have  been  established,  and  one  in  Algiers.  In  Switzerland  several trade  societies,  as 
well  as  co-operative  and  political  societies,  have  been  affiliated. 

The  special  report  of the  secretary  for America  was  also  agreed  to. 
A  conversation  then  arose  about  some  of  the  Council  members  that  were  ap 
pointed  at  the  last  Congress,  but  have  not  put  in  an  appearance  for  some  time,  nor 
paid their  annual  contributions.  It was  resolved,  "That  the  names  of all members  of 
the  Council  whose  contributions  are  not  paid  by  Tuesday,  August  27th,  be  struck 
off the  list  of  Council  members." 

As  the  evening  was  too  far  advanced,  the  discussion  of  the  Congress  questions 

was  adjourned  to  Tuesday  next.  |

|[107]|  Council Meeting Tuesday August 27. 

Citizen  Shaw  in  the  chair.  The  minutes  of the  previous  meeting  were  read  and  con 
firmed.  The  General  Secretary  reported  that  the  United  Society  of  Journeymen 
Curriers  had  announced  their  affiliation  and  the  secretary  had  paid  the  entrance 
fee.  The  London  Basket  makers  paid  their  annual  contribution  and  12s.  6d  to  the 
Congress  fund. 

The  balance  sheet  was  then  read  and  Citizens  Maurice  and  Hales  appointed  as 

auditors. 

Upon  the  proposition  of  Citizen  Fox  seconded  by  Citizen  Marx  it  was  resolved 

that  the  Congress  delegate  should  receive  12£. 

Citizen  Fox  read  a  letter  from  the  Postmaster  General  in  answer  to  the  memorial 
sent by  the  Council,  in  favour of a  reduction  of international  Postage.  The  Postmas 
ter  General  concurred  in  the  views  expressed  in  that  document. 

The  special  report  of the  American  secretary  was  read  and  adopted. 

Discussion  of  the  Congress  Questions. 

The  regular  payment  of  Contributions  was  considered  to  be  of  the  utmost  impor 
tance  as  one  of the practical means  to  enable  the  Association  to  fulfil  its  functions. 
Citizen Hales  thought the Council should  depend  less  on tTades unions  and  enter 
more  into  a general propaganda  to  attract  the foremost thinkers  in  the  various local 
ities.  Citizen  Fox  thought  we  have  local  agents  in  various  places.  Citizen  Carter 
maintained  that  with  the  exception of our  interference  in  Strikes  we  had  done  noth 
ing  and neglected  every  thing  regarding  the  practical  application  of the  great  princi 
ples  of the  Association. 

Cit.  Fox  mentioned  that  it  was  owing  to  the  International  that  the  Polish  ques 

tion  had  been  kept  alive. 

Cit.  Odger  said  we  required  discussions  upon  the  most  important  questions  of 
the  day  to  attract  public  notice  and  make  [|[108][  our  meetings  more  entertaining 
which  would  increase  our  funds  and  enable  us  to  carry  out  our  principles.  There 
was  not  sufficient  publicity  at  present. 

589 

Minutes  of the  General  Council  of the  I. W. M. A. 

Citizen  Marx  was  rather  against  turning  our  Association  into  a  debating  Club. 
We  had  made  considerable  progress  abroad  and  had  obtained  a  good  standing  in 
France.  For  weeks  together  none  of the  British  members  except  Fox,  Shaw,  Carter 
and  Buckley  had  come  near  us.  He  was  not  against  discussing  great  questions.  Cit 
izen  Odger thought  special  meetings  might  be  held  for particular  questions.  Carter, 
Mistress  Law,  Hales,  and  Fox  spoke  in  favour  of debates.  It was  then  proposed  that 
a  special  meeting  be  held  on  Thursday  to  discuss  the  second  question  which  was 
agreed  to. /

/[108]/  At  the  special  meeting  the  balance  sheet  was  adopted.  Citizen  Waltön  and 
Citizen  Swann  the  provincial  delegates  announced  in  former  meetings  were  pres 
ent.  Citizen  Walton  paid  the  entrance  fee  and  the  annual  contribution  of the  Na 
tional  Reform  League  and  Citizen  Tatschky  the  Contribution  of the  Arbeiter  Bil 
dungs  Verein. 

Cit  Fox  spoke  on  the  Credit  question  and  in  a  lengthy  Statement,  showed  that 
the  Currency  laws  of Gt.  Britain  impeded  the  growth  of popular  Credit Associations 
in  these  islands. 

Cit.  Walton  spoke  on  the  general  subject  of Credit.  No  one  else  took  part  in  the 

discussion  and  the  meeting  adjourned. |

/  Karl  Marx  sprach  über  die  Lohnarbeit  und  das  Kapital,  und  wies  mit  großer 
Klahrheit  nach  wie  die  Arbeiter  das  Kapital  geschaffen,  wie  sie  durch  das  Produkt 
ihrer  eigenen  Arbeit  in  ||  der  Sklaverei  erhalten  würden,  und  wie  das  Kapital  fort 
während  benutzt  werde  ihre  Ketten  fester  zu  schmieden.  Der  sogenannte  freie  Ar 
beiter  habe  wohl  das  Bewußtsein  freier Arbeiter  zu  sein,  aber  er  sei  um  so  mehr  in 
der  Gewalt  der  Kapitalmacht  als  er  gezwungen  sei  seine  Arbeit  für  einen  elenden 
Lohn  zu  verkaufen  um  die  allernöthigsten  Lebensbedürfnisse  dafür  zu  erhalten. 
Der  freie  Arbeiter  stehe  materiell  in  den  meisten  Fällen  unter  dem  Sklaven  und 
dem  Leibeigenen.  Die  Arbeiterklasse  brauche  nicht  das  persönliche  Eigenthum  ab 
zuschaffen,  das  sei  längst  abgeschafft,  und  werde  Tag  täglich  abgeschafft,  was je- 
doch  abgeschafft  werden  müsse  sei  das  bürgerliche  Eigenthum,  welches  doch  nur 
auf Betrug  begründet  sei. 

,·(ρ| 

In  Betreff der sozialen  Verhältnisse  in  Deutschland  bemerkte  Marx  daß  das  deut 
sche  Proletariat  noch  am  ersten  fähig  sei,  eine  Radikalkur  siegreich  durchzuführen. 
Erstens  hätten  sich  die  Deutschen  am  meisten  von  allem  religiösen  Unsinn  befreit; 
Zweitens  brauchten  sie  nicht  die  langwierige  bürgerliche  Bewegung  durchzuma1 
chen  wie  die  Arbeiter  anderer  Länder;  und  drittens  werde  sie  ihre  geographische 
Lage  zwingen  dem  östlichen Barbarismus  den Krieg  zu  erklären,  denn von dort  aus, 
von  Asien,  sei  alle  Reaktion  gegen  den  Westen  ausgegangen.  Dadurch  werde  die 
Arbeiterpartei  auf den  revolutionären  Boden  hingedrängt,  auf welchem  sie  handeln  20H 
müsse  um  sich  gänzlich  zu  befreien. /

**  Hamburg,  28. Febr.  Die  Presse  hat  schon  mehrfach  ausgesprochen,  daß  sie  die 
Ansichten  und  Lehren  der  Socialisten  von  1848  mit  dem  Auftreten  der  heutigen 
Social-Demokraten  nicht  in  Einklang  zu  bringen  vermöchte.  Die  Führer  der  socia 
len  Partei  der  Revolutionszeit  waren  vor  Allen  die  Redakteure  der  in  Cöln  erschie-
•'.5  nenen  rothen  „Neuen  Rheinischen  Zeitung"  und  unter  diesen  namentlich  Carl 
Marx  und  Friedr.  Engels.  Der Erklärung,  die  diese  beiden  Männer gegen  den  berli 
ner  „Social-Demokraten",  das  Organ  der  Lassalle'schen  Partei,  veröffentlicht  ha 
ben,  folgt  in  diesen  Tagen  eine  Brochure,  die  vom  Standpunkt  der  1848er  Sociali 
sten  aus,  eine  Kritik  der  gegenwärtigen  Verhältnisse  giebt.  Ihr  Titel  ist:  „Die 
10  preußische Militärfrage und die deutsche Arbeiterpartei" von Friedr.  Engels.  (Verlag von 
Otto  Meißner  in  Hamburg.)  Die  Brochure  ist  durchaus  eine  Streitschrift,  -  ein  hin 
geworfener  Fehdehandschuh.  Bismarck,  die  Fortschrittspartei,  -  Lassalle  und  die 
Feudalen;  -  sie  Alle  werden  aufgefordert,  den  Handschuh  aufzunehmen.  Der  Ver 
fasser  lebt  seit  der  Revolutionszeit  als  Flüchtling  in  England.  Seine  Kritik  steht 
15  nicht so  unter dem Einflüsse  der täglichen Begebenheiten und  täglich wechselnden 
Meinungen,  wie  die  Kritik  derer,  die  die  Wandelungen  im  deutschen  Vaterlande 
seit  1848  selbst mitgemacht haben.  Sie  ist rücksichtsloser,  aber auch gerechter.  Daß 
die  Brochure  großen  Beifall  finden  wird,  glauben  wir  nicht.  Bedeutendes  Aufsehen 
aber  wird  sie  machen;  sie  wird  nicht  durch  ihre  Freunde,  sondern  durch  ihre

* London, 28.Februar. In diesen Tagen erscheint bei Otto Meißner in Hamburg eine 
Broschüre von Friedr.  Engels: „Die preußische Militärfrage  und die deutsche Arbeiterpar 
tei". Sie verdankt ihren Ursprung einer Aufforderung von Seiten eines sogenannten 
„sozial-demokratischen" Blattes an den Verfasser, sich über diesen Gegenstand in 
diesem Blatte  auszusprechen.  Eine  eingehende Behandlung  des  Gegenstandes er 
forderte jedoch mehr Raum, als einer Zeitung zu Gebote stand, und die bismarcko-
phile Richtung, die die neueste „Sozial-Demokratie" genommen, machte es außer 
dem den Leuten von der „Neuen Rheinischen Zeitung" unmöglich, an dem Organe 
dieser  Sozial-Demokratie  mitzuarbeiten.  So  entwickelt  denn  die  Broschüre  den 
Standpunkt,  den die  „Sozialdemokraten von  1848"  sowohl der Regierung wie der 
Fortschrittspartei gegenüber einnehmen. Lassalle war auch ein Sozialdemokrat von 
1848. Er ging aus der Schule von Karl Marx hervor. Ein Kritiker anderer Partei aber 
behauptete  einmal: Lassalle sei in dieser Schule nur bis zur Quarta avancirt.

Marx  und  Friedrich  Engels,  die  Redacteure  der  ehemaligen  Neuen  Rheinischen 
Zeitung,  sich  vom  „Social-Demokrat"  und  damit  von  der  heutigen  Lassalle'schen

Militärfrage  und die deutsche Arbeiterpartei".  Zwei Broschüren,  die  zur Zeit  des  italie

und  der  Rhein"  werden  ihren  Lesern  noch  im  Gedächtniß  sein.  Sie  haben  ihrer 
Zeit  verdientes  Aufsehen  gemacht,  obgleich  ihr  Verfasser  damals  seinen  Namen 
nicht  nannte.  Diese  neueste  Broschüre  ist  gewissermaßen  ein  Glaubensbekenntniß 
der  Socialisten,  deren  Schüler  Lassalle  war;  sie  critisirt  diesen  Schüler,  sein  Ver-
hältniß  zu  Bismarck,  seine  Fortschrittsfeinde,  und  wahrt  das  Princip  der  alten  so-

nen,  und  keine  Lust  haben,  sich  der  Reaction  in  die  Arme  zu  werfen.  -  Ich  will 
hier noch  erwähnen,  daß  in  den nächsten Tagen  bei  Meißner  in  Hamburg  eine  Bro 
chure  von  Engels  erscheinen  wird,  betitelt:  „Die  preußische  Militärfrage  und  die 
deutsche  Arbeiterpartei".  Der  Verfasser  wendet  sich  darin  auf  das  Entschiedenste 
gegen  die  preußische  Regierung  und  weist  nach,  daß  ein  Bündniß  der Arbeiter  mit 
der  Reaction  für  die  ersteren  nur  die  schlimmsten  Folgen  haben  könnte.

Nr. 2,  Februar 1866 

|31j  In  religiöser  Hinsicht  geht jetzt  in  dem  verdumpften  England  eine  bedeutungs 
volle  Bewegung  vor  sich.  Die  ersten  Männer  der  Wissenschaft  Huxley  (Darwins 
Schule)  an  der  Spitze  mit  Charles  Lyell,  Bowring,  Carpenter usw.  geben  in  St.  Mar^ 
tin's  Hall  höchst  aufgeklärte,  wahrhaft  kühne,  freigeistige  Vorlesungen  für  ||32|  das 
Volk,  und  zwar  an  Sonntagabenden,  gerade  zu  der  Stunde,  wo  sonst  die  Schäflein 
zur  Weide  des  Herrn  pilgerten;  die  Halle  war  massenhaft  voll  und  der  Jubel  des 
Volkes  so  groß,  daß  am  ersten  Sonntagabend,  wo  ich  mit  meiner  Familie  zugegen 
war,  mehr  als  2000  Menschen  keinen  Einlaß  mehr  in  den  zum  Ersticken  angefüll 
ten  Raum  finden  konnten.  Drei  Mal  ließen  die  Pfaffen  das  Entsetzliche  gesche 
hen.  -  Gestern  Abend  jedoch  wurde  der  Versammlung  angekündigt,  daß  keine 
Vorlesungen  mehr gehalten  werden  dürften,  bis  der Prozeß  der  Seelsorger gegen  die 
Sunday  evenings  for  the  people  (Sonntagsvortrage  für  das  Volk)  erledigt  sei.  Die 
Entrüstung  der  Versammlung  sprach  sich  entschieden  aus  und  mehr  als  100  Pfund 
Sterling  wurden  sofort  zur  Führung  des  Prozesses  gesammelt.  Wie  dumm  von  den 
Pfäfllein  sich  einzumischen.  Zum  Aerger  der  Frömmlerbande  schlössen  die 
Abende  auch  noch  mit  Musik.  Chöre  von  Händel,  Mozart,  Beethoven,  Mendels 
sohn  und  Gounod  wurden  gesungen  und  mit  Enthusiasmus  von  den  Engländern 
aufgenommen,  denen  bisher  an  Sonntagen  nur  erlaubt  war  „Jesus,  Jesus  meek  and 
mild"  (Jesus,  Jesus  sanft  und  mild)  zu  grölen,  oder  in  den  Ginpalast  (Schnaps 
schenke)  zu  wandern. |

Monsieur  Vésinier. 

5  L'Echo  de  Verviers  dans  son  N°  293,  suivant  à la  date  du  16  Décembre  1865,  a  pu 
blié  un  article,  ayant  pour  but  ostensible  d'éclairer  les  travailleurs  sur  l'esprit  qui 
anime  la  majorité  des  membres  du  conseil  central  de  l'association  internationale 
des  travailleurs ;  le  citoyen Le  Lubez,  qui l'a présenté  au conseil  (comme  il en  avait 
été  chargé),  a  reconnu,  que  quoiqu'anonyme,  cet  article  était  dû  à  votre  plume. 
10  Après  en  avoir été saisi,  le  conseil central,  dans son  assemblée  du  9 Janvier  1866,  a 
adopté  la résolution  suivante :  Le  citoyen Vésinier est  sommé  d'établir les faits qu'il 
avance,  en  cas  de  refus  ou  d'incapacité  il  sera  rayé  de  l'association  internationale 
des  travailleurs. 

Votre  article  s'écartant  entièrement  de  la  vérité,  le  conseil  central  a  cru  de  son 
15  devoir  de  rétablir  les  faits  dans  toute  leur  intégrité;  le  conseil  central  a  la 
conscience  de  sa  mission  et  du  mandat  qu'on  lui  a  confié ;  il  ne  repoussera  pas  les 
calomnies  par des  calomnies  ni  les  mensonges  par des  mensonges ;  il  ne  s'abaissera 
pas  à  des  accusations personnelles,  mais  il laissera,  à  ceux  qui  sont  accusés,  le  soin 
de  se justifier eux-mêmes ;  il ne  s'arrêtera  devant  aucun  obstacle  et,  malgré  les  faux 

20  amis,  il  ne  laissera  derrière  lui  ni  tache  ni  souillure. 

Entr'autres,  les  passages  suivants  méritent  principalement  d'être  signalés :

Sur  9  membres  français  2  seulement  se  retirèrent  savoir:  MM.  Dénouai  et Le  Lu 
bez  et même  ce  dernier rentra  peu  de  temps  après ;  -  quant  aux Italiens,  un  seul  (le 
Citoyen  Wolff)  motiva  sa  démission  «non  sur  la présence  au  sein  du  comité  et sur  les 
intrigues de MM.  Tolain et Fribourg»  mais  sur une résolution  du  Conseil Central,  pré-
30  sentée  par  le  Sous  Comité,  concernant  le  citoyen  Lefort  en  faveur  de  laquelle  il 
,  avait lui-même voté,  quelques heures auparavant,  comme membre du  Sous  Comité.

les  français  et  les  Italiens,  avant  même  que  le  publiciste  eminent  de  race  latine  en

Le  Conseil  Central  ne  commença  guère  à  fonctionner  que  vers  le  commence

9  mois  «de  temps précieux»  à  établir  des  relations  internationales  et  à  étendre  ses  re 
lations  en  Angleterre.  Chaque  semaine,  pendant  plusieurs  mois,  des  deputations 
composées  de  membres  du  Conseil,  furent  envoyées  auprès  des  différentes  sociétés 
ouvrières  pour les  engager à  se joindre  à l'association ;  En voici  le  résultat :  Lors des 
conférences,  ||[5]|  l'Association  Internationale  des  Travailleurs  comptait :  en Angle

«Non ! il (le Comité)  n'a pas même fait  venir à ses conférences de  Septembre  1865  un dé 
légué de l'Allemagne,  qui compte tant de Sociétés d'ouvriers, pas un seul non plus des So 
ciétés si nombreuses de  l'Angleterre, pas  un seul de celles d'Italie,  si bien  organisées,  pas 
un seul de  celles qui existent en  France ;  Car  Tolain,  Fribourg et C'e  ne sont les délégués 
d'aucune  Société  d'ouvriers  Français,  ils  se  sont  délégués  eux-mêmes,  ils  n'ont fourni  la 
preuve d'aucun  mandat dont ils aient  \\[7]\  été revêtus.  Loin d'être les délégués d'associa 
tions ouvrières françaises, leur présence a été la seule cause qui a empêché celles-ci d'en 
voyer des délégués aux Conférences de Londres. Nous pourrions citer plusieurs d'entr'elles 
qui ont  refusé pour  ce  motif d'y  adhérer etc,  etc,»  (Echo  de  Verviers 293.) 

En  principe,  seules  les  sections  de  l'association  Internationale  des  ouvriers  et les 
Sociétés  qui  avaient  adhéré  à  ses  principes  pouvaient  être  représentées  aux  Confé 
rences ;  l'état  de  nos  finances  nous  enjoignait  de  limiter  le  nombre  des  délégués  au 
plus  bas  minimum. 

De  l'Allemagne  qui  compte  tant  de  Sociétés  d'ouvriers,  les  seules  qui auraient pu 
être  représentées  sont les  Sociétés  de  consommation  fondées  par  Schulze-Delitzsch 
et celles  de  Lassalle, A.D.A.V.;  les  premières,  à  l'insu  de  leurs  membres,  n'étaient 
que  l'instrument  de  la  Bourgeoisie  libérale  de  Prusse  dont  Schulze-Delitzsch  est un 
des  matadores ;  celles  de  Lassalle  étaient  et  sont  encore  aujourd'hui  en  complète 
dissolution ;  une  ||[8]|  partie  s'était  coalisée  avec  Bismark  tandis  que  l'autre  partie, 
qui ne  s'était pas  encore  reconstituée,  reconnaissait pour  chef J. Ph. Becker,  délégué 
Suisse  aux  conférences ;  pendant  la  Séance  des  conférences  ce  dernier  reçut  un 
mandat  de  la  part  des  ouvriers  des  fabriques  de  Solingen ;  tandis  que  la  Société  Al 
lemande  de  Genève  D. Α.  Β.  V.  était  aussi  représentée  par  lui ;  La  Société  Alle 
mande  de  Londres  D. Α.  Β. V.  fut  représentée  par  ses  délégués  auprès  du  Conseil 
Central.  Outre  les  entraves  que  les  ouvriers  rencontrent  dans  la  formation  de  Socié 
tés  en  Allemagne,  la  législation  leur  défend  encore  d'appartenir  à  des  Sociétés 
étrangères,  cependant  quelques  sections  furent  formées  dans  le  Nord  et  le  Sud  de

de  la  Reform League  et  membre  du  Conseil  exécutif des  maçons  et Coulson,  Secré

Central;  Wheeler,  gérant  d'une  assurance  mutuelle  sur  la  vie  est  membre  du 
Conseil  Central.  Les  Cordonniers  (forts  de  5500  membres)  sont  représentés par Od

«Nous  le  demandons est-ce  là  un  résultat satisfaisant»  (Echo  de  Verviers  N°  293) 

Le  Conseil  Central  est  composé  presqu'exclusivement  d'ouvriers  habitués  à  ma 
nier  le  marteau  et  la  lime  et  ce  n'est  qu'au  prix  de  sacrifices  personnels  qu'ils  peu 
vent  les  remplacer  par  la  plume ;  quand  ils  ont  recours  à  la  plume,  c'est  toujours 
pour  défendre  ou  propager  une  noble  cause  et  non  pour  la  vendre  au  Bonapar 
tisme ;  si  le  résultat  n'est  pas  aussi  satisfaisant  que  les  ouvriers  en  général  auraient 
pu l'espérer,  nous  sommes  convaincus  qu'ils  prendront  en  considération  les veilles 
passées  après  une  longue  journée  d'un  travail  fatigant  et  les  angoisses  que  leurs 
frères  ont  éprouvées  pour  l'amener  à  ce  point.

Nous  remercions  beaucoup  le  citoyen Talandier de  sa lettre  et  nous  nous  faisons un 
vrai  plaisir  de  l'insérer,  car  nous  tenons  à  dégager  de  la  forte  personnalité  de  Lar-
daux  cet  amour  puissant  de  l'Humanité,  qui lui  a  fait  coopérer  activement  à  l'Asso 
ciation  internationale  de  1855  et  à  celle  de  1864. 

Nous  ferons  remarquer  cependant  au  citoyen  Talandier  que  l'Association  inter 
nationale  de  1855  n'était pas la première  de  ce genre.  Déjà  en  1846,  des  révolution 
naires  socialistes,  sentant  venir  le  mouvement,  voulurent  organiser  dans  tous  les 
pays  des  groupes  pour  propager  la  Révolution. 

Le  comité  central  de  l'Association  démocratique  internationale  avait  son  siège  à 
Bruxelles.  Le  citoyen  Mellinet,  le père  du général bonapartiste,  en  était le  président 
honoraire ;  parmi les  autres membres,  pour ne  citer que  les morts,  se  trouvaient Le-
lewel  (Polonais),  Imbert  (Français),  etc.  ...  Ce  comité  était représenté  dans  tous  les 
pays  de  l'Europe,  l'Italie  exceptée. 

A  Londres  il  avait  des  relations  avec  la  société  des  «Fraternal  démocrates»,  à  la 
tête  de  laquelle  étaient  les  chefs  les  plus  fougueux  du  mouvement  chartiste.  Cette 
association  y  avait  une  telle  influence,  qu'en  1848  les  Anglais  envoyèrent  à  Paris 
une  deputation,  dans  laquelle  se  trouvaient  Ernest  Jones,  Julian  Harney,  etc.,  pour 
les  représenter  au  gouvernement  provisoire. 

En  France,  le  comité  central  était  en  rapport  avec  Proudhon  et  les  rédacteurs  de 

la  Réforme,  entre  autres  Flocon. 

Le  comité  avait  fondé  aussi  des  groupes  à  Cologne,  Berlin  et  autres  centres  du 

mouvement  allemand. 

Longtemps  avant  cette  association,  Mazzini  avait  fondé  une  association  interna 
tionale  :  La jeune Europe;  mais  sur  d'autres  bases  et  avec  d'autres  vues  que  les  trois 
précédentes.

131  Manifeste 
de  l'Association Internationale  des  Travailleurs (1). 

Ouvriers, 

C'est  un  fait  très-remarquable  que  la  misère  des  masses  travailleuses  n'a  pas  dimi 
nué  de  1848  à  1864,  et pourtant cette période  défie  toute  comparaison pour le  déve 
loppement  de  l'industrie  et  l'accroissement  du  commerce.  En  1850,  un  organe  mo 
déré  de  la  bourgeoisie (2)  anglaise,  très-bien  informé  d'ordinaire,  prédisait  que  si 
l'exportation  et  l'importation  de  l'Angleterre  s'élevaient  de  50  pour  cent,  le  pau 
périsme  tomberait  à  zéro.  Hélas!  le  7  avril  1864  le  chancelier  de  l'échiquier  char 
mait  son  auditoire  parlementaire  en  lui  annonçant  que  le  commerce  anglais  d'im 
portation  et  d'exportation  était  monté  en  1863  «à  443 955000  livres  sterling 
(11098 875 000  fr.),  somme  étonnante  qui  surpasse  presque  des  deux tiers  le  com 
merce  de  l'époque  relativement  récente  de  1843 ».  Mais  en  même  temps  il  parlait 
éloquemment de la « misère ».  « Songez,  s'écria-t-il,  à  ceux qui vivent sur le bord de 
cette  horrible  région. »  Avec  non  |[4|  moins  d'éloquence  il  parlait  des  salaires  qui 
n'augmentaient  point,  de  la  vie  humaine  «qui  dans  neuf cas  sur  dix  n'est  qu'une 
lutte  pour  l'existence ». 

Encore ne  disait-il rien des  Irlandais que remplacent graduellement les machines 
dans  le  Nord,  les  troupeaux  de  moutons  dans  le  Sud,  quoique  les  moutons  eux-

(1) Ce manifeste, dû à la plume d'un socialiste allemand eminent, membre du Conseil central 
de Londres, a été publié, en anglais, il y a dix-huit mois, à la suite du meeting où a été fondée 
l'Association internationale. 

Nous avons pensé que nos lecteurs seraient heureux de le connaître. 

(2) Le manifeste dit : « middle-class », littéralement : classe moyenne. Mais cette expression, 
dans la plupart  des  pays  du  continent,  n'a  pas  le  même  sens  qu'en  Angleterre.  En  France, 
l'ouvrier affranchi  du  salariat,  celui qui  travaille  à son compte,  appartient,  comme le bouti 
quier, à la classe moyenne. 

La classe  moyenne  en  Angleterre,  c'est plutôt  la  bourgeoisie  capitaliste  ou  rentière,  qui, 
dans les pays où n'existe plus l'aristocratie héréditaire et privilégiée, est devenue la classe su 
périeure.

mêmes  diminuent  dans  ce  malheureux pays,  moins  rapidement,  il  est vrai,  que les 
hommes.  Il  ne  répétait  pas  ce  que  venaient  de  dévoiler,  dans  un  accès  soudain  de 
terreur,  les  représentants  les  plus  élevés  des  «dix  mille  supérieurs»  (1). 

Lorsque  la  panique  des  garrotteurs  atteignit  un  certain  degré,  la  chambre  des 
lords  fit  faire  une  enquête  et  un  rapport  sur la  transportation  et  la  servitude  pénale. 
Le meurtre  fit  ainsi  son  apparition  et tint sa place  dans  le volumineux Livre bleu de 
1863  et  il  fut  alors  prouvé,  par  faits  et  chiffres  officiels,  que  les  pires  des  criminels 
condamnés,  les  forçats  de  l'Angleterre  et  de  l'Ecosse,  travaillaient  beaucoup  moins 
et  étaient beaucoup  mieux nourris  que  les  travailleurs  agricoles  des  mêmes  pays. 

Mais  ce  n'est  pas  tout. 
Quand  la  guerre  d'Amérique  eut jeté  sur  le  pavé  les  ouvriers  des  comtés  de  Lan 
caster  et  de  Chester,  la  même  chambre  des  lords  envoya  un  médecin  dans  les  pro 
vinces  manufacturières,  en  le  chargeant  de  rechercher la  quantité  minimum  de  car 
bone  et  d'azote,  administrable  sous  la  forme  la  plus  simple  et  la  moins  chère,  qui 
pût  suffire  en  moyenne  «à  prévenir  la  mort  d'inanition».  Le  docteur  Smith,  le  mé 
decin  délégué,  trouva  que  28 000  grains  de  carbone  et  1330  grains  d'azote  par  se 
maine  étaient  nécessaires,  en  moyenne,  à un  adulte,  rien  que  pour  le  garantir  de  la 
mort  d'inanition,  et  de  plus  il  trouva  que  cette  quantité  n'était  pas  fort  éloignée  de 
la  maigre  nourriture  à  laquelle  l'extrême  détresse  venait  de  réduire  les  ouvriers  co 
tonniers. 

Mais  écoutez  encore.  Le  même  savant  médecin  fut  un  peu  ||5|  plus  tard  délégué 
de  nouveau par le  département médical du  Conseil  Privé,  afin  d'examiner la nourri 
ture  des  classes  travailleuses  les  plus  pauvres.  Le  Sixième rapport sur l'état de la santé 
publique,  publié  par  l'ordre  du  Parlement  dans  le  courant  de  cette  année  (1864), 
contient  le  résultat  de  ses  recherches.  Qu'a  découvert  le  docteur?  Que  les  tisseurs 
en  soie,  les  couturières,  les  gantiers,  les  tisserands  de  bas,  etc.,  ne  recevaient  pas 
toujours,  en  moyenne,  la  misérable  pitance  des  ouvriers  cotonniers,  pas  même  la 
quantité  de  carbone  et  d'azote  «suffisant  à  prévenir  la  mort  d'inanition». 

«En  outre»,  nous  citons  textuellement  le  rapport,  «l'examen  de  l'état  des  fa 
milles  agricoles  a  démontré  que  plus  du  cinquième  d'entre  elles  est  réduit  à  une 
quantité  moins  que  suffisante  d'aliments  carboniques,  et  plus  du  tiers  à  une  quan 
tité  moins  que  suffisante  d'aliments  azotés ;  que  dans  les  comtés  de  Berks,  d'Oxford 
et  de  Somerset,  l'insuffisance  des  aliments  azotés  est,  en  moyenne,  le  régime  local. 
Il  ne  faut  pas  oublier,  ajoute  le  rapport  officiel,  que  la  privation  de  nourriture  n'est 
supportée  qu'avec  répugnance,  et  qu'en  règle  générale  le  manque  de  nourriture  suf 
fisante  n'arrive  jamais  que  précédé  de  bien  d'autres  privations.  La  propreté  même 
est  regardée  comme  une  chose  très-chère  et  difficile,  et  quand  le  respect  de  soi-
même  s'efforce  de  l'entretenir,  chaque  effort  de  la  sorte  est  nécessairement  payé  par 
un  surcroît  des  tortures  de  la  faim.  Ce  sont  des  réflexions  d'autant  plus  doulou 
reuses,  qu'il ne  s'agit pas  ici  de la misère méritée par la paresse,  mais,  dans  tous  les 
cas,  de  la  détresse  d'une  population  travailleuse.  En  fait,  le  travail  qui  n'assure 
qu'une  si  maigre  pitance  est  pour  le  plus  grand  nombre  excessivement  prolongé.»

des  Travailleurs  suivi  du  Règlement  provisoire. 
Bruxelles  1866.  Titelblatt 

Manifeste  de  l'Association  Internationale  des  Travailleurs  (Adresse  inaugurale) 

Le  rapport  dévoile  ce  fait  étrange  et  même  inattendu:  «que  de  toutes  les  parties 
du  Royaume-Uni»,  c'est-à-dire  l'Angleterre,  le  pays  de  Galles,  l'Ecosse  et  l'Irlande, 
«c'est  la  population  agricole  de  l'Angleterre»,  précisément  de  la  partie  la plus  opu 
lente,  «qui  est  incontestablement  le  plus  mal  nourrie»,  mais  que  même  les  plus 
5  pauvres  laboureurs  des  comtés  de  Berks,  d'Oxford  et  de  Somerset  sont  beau-| 
|6|coup  mieux  nourris  que  la  plupart  des  ouvriers  en  chambre  de  l'Est  de  Londres. 
Telles  sont  les  données  officielles  publiées  par ordre  du Parlement,  en  1864,  dans 
le millénaire  du  libre-échange,  au moment même  où  le  chancelier de  l'échiquier ra 
contait  à  la  chambre  des  communes  «que  la  condition  des  ouvriers  anglais  s'est 
10  améliorée,  en  moyenne,  d'une  manière  si  extraordinaire,  que  nous  n'en  connais 
sons  point  d'exemple  dans  l'histoire  d'aucun  pays,  ni  d'aucun  âge».  De  quel  son 
discordant  ces  exaltations  officielles  sont  percées  par  une  brève  remarque  du  non 
moins  officiel rapport  sur l'état  de  la  santé  publique :  «La  santé  publique  d'un pays 
signifie  la  santé  de  ses  masses,  et  il  est  presque  impossible  que  les  masses  soient 
15  bien  portantes,  si  elles  ne  jouissent  pas  jusqu'au  plus  bas  de  l'échelle  sociale,  au 

moins,  de  la  plus  modeste  prospérité. » 

Ébloui  par  le  «Progrès  de  la  Nation  (1)»  le  chancelier  de  l'Échiquier voit  danser 
devant ses  yeux  les  chiffres  de  ses  statistiques.  C'est  avec un  accent  de véritable  ex 
tase  qu'il  s'écrie:  «De  1842  à  1852,  le  revenu  imposable  du  pays  s'est  accru  de 
20  6 p.c. ;  dans les huit années  de  1853  à  1861,  il s'est accru de 20 p.c. ;  c'est un fait si 
étonnant  qu'il  est  presque  incroyable! 
...  Cette  enivrante  augmentation  de  ri 
chesses  et  de  puissance»,  ajoute  M.Gladstone,  «est exclusivement restreinte  à  ceux 
qui  possèdent». 

Si vous  voulez  savoir à  quelles  conditions  de  santé  perdue,  de  morale  flétrie et  de 
25  mine intellectuelle, cette  enivrante augmentation de richesses et de puissance,  exclusive 
ment  restreinte  aux  classes  qui possèdent,  a  été  et  est  produite  par  les  classes  labo 
rieuses,  examinez  la  peinture  qui  est  faite  des  ateliers  de tailleurs,  d'imprimeurs  et 
de  modistes,  dans  le  dernier  Rapport  sur  l'état  de  la  santé  publique!  Comparez  le 
Rapport  de  la  commission pour examiner  le  travail des  enfants,  où  il  est  constaté,  par 
30  exemple,  que  «la  classe  des  potiers,  hommes  et  femmes,  présente  une  population 
très-dégénérée,  tant  sous  le  rapport  physique  que  sous  le  ||7|  rapport  intellectuel»; 
que  «les  enfants  infirmes  deviennent  ensuite  des  parents  infirmes»;  que  «la  dégé 
nération  de  la  race  en  est  une  conséquence  absolue»;  que  «la  dégénération  de  la 
population  du  comté  de  Stafford  serait  beaucoup  plus  avancée,  n'était  le  recrute-
35  ment  continuel  des  pays  adjacents  et  les  mariages  mixtes  avec  des  races  plus  ro 
bustes».  Jetez  un  coup  d'oeil  sur  le  Livre  bleu  de  M. Tremenheere,  Griefs et plaintes 
des  journaliers  boulangers.  Et  qui  n'a  pas  frissonné  en  lisant  ce  paradoxe  des  inspec 
teurs  des  fabriques,  certifié  par  le  Registrar  General,  d'après  lequel  la  santé  des 
ouvriers  du  comté  de  Lancaster  s'est  améliorée  considérablement,  quoiqu'ils  soient 
40  réduits  à  la  plus  misérable  nourriture,  parce  que  le  manque  de  coton  les  a  chassés 
des fabriques  cotonnières ;  que  la mortalité  des  enfants  a  diminué,  parce  qu'enfin  il 
est  permis  aux  mères  de  leur  donner,  au  lieu  du  cordial  de  Godfrey,  leurs  propres 
mamelles.

Mais retournez  encore une fois la médaille !  Le Tableau de  l'impôt des  revenus et 
des  propriétés,  présenté  à  la  chambre  des  communes  le  20  juillet  1864,  nous  ap 
prend  que  du  5  avril  1852  au  5  avril  1863,  treize  personnes  ont  grossi  les  rangs  de 
ces  heureux  de  la  terre,  dont  les  revenus  annuels  sont  évalués  par  le  collecteur  des 
impôts  à  50000  1. st.  (1250000  fr.)  et  plus,  car  leur  nombre  est  monté,  dans  une 
seule  année,  de  67  à  80  (1).  Le  même  Tableau  dévoile  le  fait  curieux  que  3000 per 
sonnes,  à  peu  près,  partagent  entre  elles  un  revenu  annuel  d'environ  25 000000  de 
liv.  steri.  (750000000  fr.),  plus  que  la  somme  totale  distribuée  annuellement  entre 
tous  les  laboureurs  de  l'Angleterre  et  du  pays  de  Galles.  Ouvrez  le  registre  du  cens 
de  1861  et  vous  trouverez  que  le  nombre  des  propriétaires  terriens  en Angleterre et 
dans  le pays  de Galles,  s'est réduit de  16 934  en  1851,  à  15 066  en  1861 ;  qu'ainsi la 
concentration  de  la  propriété  territoriale  s'est  accrue  en  dix  années  de  11  p.  c.  Si la 
concentration  de  la  propriété  foncière  dans  la  main  d'un  petit  nombre  suit  tou-| 
|8(jours  le  même  progrès,  la  question  territoriale  deviendra  singulièrement  simpli 
fiée,  comme  elle  l'était  dans  l'empire  romain,  quand  Néron  grinça  des  dents  (2),  à 
la  nouvelle  que  la  moitié  de  la  province  d'Afrique  était  possédée  par  six  chevaliers. 

Nous  nous  sommes  appesantis  sur ces  «faits  si  étonnants,  qu'ils  sont  presque  in 
croyables»,  parce  que  l'Angleterre  est  à  la  tête  de  l'Europe  commerciale  et  indus 
trielle.  Rappelez-vous  qu'il  y  a  quelques  mois  à  peine  un  des  fils  réfugiés  de  Louis-
Philippe  félicitait  publiquement  le  travailleur  agricole  anglais  de  la  supériorité  de 
son  sort,  sur  celui  moins  prospère  de  ses  camarades  de  l'autre  côté  de  la  Manche. 
En  vérité,  si  nous  tenons  compte  de  la  différence  des  circonstances  locales,  nous 
voyons  les  faits  anglais  se  reproduire  sur une  plus  petite  échelle  dans  tous  les  pays 
industriels  et  progressifs  du  continent.  Depuis  1848,  un  développement  inouï  de 
l'industrie  et une  expansion inimaginable  des  exportations  et  des  importations  a eu 
lieu  dans  ces  pays.  Partout  «l'augmentation  de  richesses  et  de  puissance  exclusive 
ment  restreinte  aux  classes  qui  possèdent»,  a  été  réellement  «enivrante».  Partout, 
comme  en Angleterre,  une petite minorité de la classe  ouvrière  a  obtenu réellement 
une  petite  augmentation  de  salaire ;  mais,  dans  la  plupart  des  cas,  la  hausse  moné 
taire  des  salaires  ne  dénotait  pas  plus  l'accroissement  du  bien-être  des  salariés,  que 
l'élévation  du  coût  de  l'entretien  des  pensionnaires  dans  l'hôpital  des  pauvres  ou 
dans l'asile des orphelins de la métropole, de 7  liv.  7  sh.  4 p.,  en  1852,  à 9 liv.  15 sh. 
8  p.,  en  1862,  ne  leur  bénéficie  et  n'augmente  leur  bien-être.  Partout  la  grande 
masse  des  classés  laborieuses  descendait  toujours  plus  bas,  dans  la  même  propor 
tion  au  moins,  que  celles  qui  sont  au-dessus  d'elle  montaient  plus  haut  sur l'échelle 
sociale.  Dans  tous  les  pays  de  l'Europe  -  c'est  devenu  actuellement  ||9|  une  vérité 
incontestable  à  tout  esprit  impartial,  et  déniée  par  ceux-là  seulement  dont  l'intérêt 
consiste  à  promettre  aux  autres  monts  et  merveilles  -  ni  le  perfectionnement  des 
machines,  ni  l'application  de  la  science  à  la  production,  ni  la  découverte  de  nou-

(2) Le mot «grind» veut dire non-seulement grincer des dents, mais indique encore la férocité 
du sourire. Néron,  en  tuant ses sangsues gorgées  d'or,  éprouva une joie féroce,  car il trouva 
ainsi le moyen de remplir les coffres de l'État,  qui se vidaient à mesure  que la propriété fon 
cière se concentrait.

velles  communications,  ni  les  nouvelles  colonies,  ni  l'émigration,  ni  la  création  de 
nouveaux  débouchés,  ni  le  libre-échange,  ni  toutes  ces  choses  ensemble  ne  sont  en 
état  de  supprimer  la  misère  des  classes  laborieuses ;  au  contraire,  tant  que  la  base 
fausse  d'à  présent  existera,  chaque  nouveau  développement  de  la  force  productive 
du  travail  creusera  nécessairement un  abîme  plus  large  et  plus  profond  entre  les  dif 
férentes  classes  et  fera  ressortir  davantage  l'antagonisme  social. 

Durant  cette  enivrante  époque  de  progrès  économique,  la  mort  d'inanition  s'est 
élevée  à  la  hauteur  d'une  institution  sociale  dans  la  métropole  britannique.  Cette 
époque  est  marquée,  dans  les  annales  du  monde,  par  les  retours  accélérés,  par 
l'étendue  de  plus  en  plus vaste  et par les  effets  de  plus  en  plus  meurtriers  de  la peste 
sociale,  appelée :  la crise commerciale et industrielle. 

Après  la  défaite  des  révolutions  de  1848,  toutes  les  associations  et  tous  les jour 
naux  politiques  des  classes  ouvrières  furent  écrasés,  sur  le  continent,  par  la  main 
brutale  de  la  force ;  les  plus  avancés  parmi  les  fils  du  travail  s'enfuirent  désespérés 
de  l'autre  côté  de  l'Océan,  aux  États-Unis,  et  les  rêves  éphémères  d'affranchisse 
ment  s'évanouirent  devant  une  époque  de  fièvre  industrielle,  de  marasme  moral  et 
de  réaction  politique. 

Dû  en partie  à la  diplomatie  anglaise,  qui  agissait  alors  comme  maintenant  dans 
un  esprit  de  solidarité  fraternelle  avec  le  cabinet  de  Saint-Pétersbourg,  l'échec  de  la 
classe  ouvrière  continentale  répandit  bientôt  ses  effets  contagieux  de  ce  côté  de  la 
Manche.  La  défaite  de  leurs  frères  du  continent,  en  faisant  perdre  aux  ouvriers  an 
glais  toute  virilité,  toute  foi  dans  leur  propre  cause,  rendait  en  même  temps  au  sei 
gneur  de  la  terre  et  au  seigneur  de  l'argent,  au  propriétaire  et  au  capitaliste,  leur 
confiance  quelque  peu  ébranlée.  Ils  retirèrent  isolemment  les  concessions  déjà  an 
noncées. I 

|10|  La  découverte  de  nouveaux  terrains  aurifères  amena  une  immense  émigra 
tion  et  creusa  un  vide  irréparable  dans  les  rangs  du  prolétariat  de  la  Grande-Bre 
tagne.  D'autres  parmi  ses  membres  les  plus  actifs jusque-là  furent  séduits  par  l'ap 
pât  temporaire  d'un  travail  plus  abondant  et  de  salaires  plus  élevés  et  devinrent 
ainsi  des  «noirs  politiques»  (1). 

En  vain  essaya-t-on  d'entretenir  ou  de  réformer  le  mouvement  chartiste,  tous  les 
efforts  échouèrent  complètement.  Dans  la  presse  les  organes  de  la  classe  ouvrière 
moururent  l'un  après  l'autre  de  l'apathie  des  masses  et,  en  fait, jamais  l'ouvrier  an 
glais  n'avait  paru  accepter  si  entièrement  sa  nullité  politique. 

Donc,  s'il  n'y  avait  pas  eu  solidarité  d'action  entre  la  classe  ouvrière  de  la 
Grande-Bretagne  et  celle  du  continent,  il y  avait  en tout  cas  entre  elles  solidarité  de 
défaite. 

Cependant  cette  période  écoulée  depuis  les  Révolutions  de  1848  a  eu  aussi  ses 

compensations.  Nous  n'indiquerons  ici  que  deux  faits  très-importants. 

Après  une  lutte  de  trente  années,  soutenue  avec  la  plus  admirable  persévérance, 
la  classe  ouvrière  anglaise,  profitant  d'une  brouille  momentanée  entre  les  maîtres 
de  la  terre  et  les  maîtres  de  l'argent,  réussit  à  enlever  le  bill  des  dix  heures. 

Les  immenses  bienfaits  physiques,  moraux  et  intellectuels  qui  en  résultèrent 

(1) On appelle ainsi, en anglais, l'homme qui trahit ses principes et est infidèle  à sa cause.

Karl  Marx 

pour  les  ouvriers  des  manufactures  ont  été  enregistrés  dans  les  rapports  bisannuels 
des  inspecteurs  des  fabriques,  et  de  tous  côtés  on  se plaît maintenant  à les  reconnaî 
tre.  La  plupart  des  gouvernements  continentaux  furent  obligés  d'accepter  la  loi  an? 
glaise  dans  les  manufactures,  sous  une  forme  plus  ou  moins  modifiée,  et  le  Parle 
ment  anglais  est  lui-même  chaque  année  forcé  d'étendre  et  d'élargir  le  cercle  de 
son  action. 

Mais  à  côté  de son utilité pratique,  il y  avait  dans  la loi  certains  autres  caractères 
bien  faits  pour  en  rehausser  le  merveilleux  succès.  Par  l'organe  de  ses  oracles  les 
plus connus,  tels que le docteur Ure,  le professeur Senior et autres  ||11|  philosophes 
de  cette  trempe,  la  bourgeoisie  avait  prédit  et,  à  sa  grande  satisfaction,  démontré 
que  toute  intervention  de  la  loi  pour  limiter  les  heures  de  travail  devait  sonner  le 
glas  de l'industrie  anglaise  qui,  semblable  au vampire,  ne pouvait vivre  que  de  sang, 
et  du  sang  des  enfants,  elle  aussi.  Jadis  le  meurtre  d'un  enfant  était  un  rite  mysté 
rieux de  la religion  de  Moloch, mais  on ne  le  pratiquait qu'en des occasions  très-so 
lennelles,  une  fois  par  an  peut-être,  et  encore  Moloch  n'avait-il  pas  de  penchant  ex 
clusif pour  les  enfants  du  pauvre. 

Ce  qui,  dans  cette  question  de  la  limitation  légale  des  heures  de  travail,  donnait 
au  conflit  un  véritable  caractère  d'acharnement  et  de  fureur,  c'est  que,  sans  parler 
des  terreurs  de  l'avarice,  la  question  engagée  soulevait  de  nouveau  et  décidait 
même  en  partie  la  grande  querelle  entre  la loi  aveugle  de  l'offre  et la  demande,  qui 
est  toute  l'économie  politique  de  la  classe  bourgeoise,  et  la  production  sociale 
contrôlée  et  régie  par  la  prévoyance  sociale,  qui  constitue  l'économie  politique  de 
la  classe  ouvrière. 

Le  bill  des  dix  heures  ne  fut  donc  pas  seulement  un  succès  pratique ;  ce  fut  aussi 
le  triomphe  d'un  principe :  pour  la  première  fois,  au  grand  jour,  l'économie  politi 
que  de la  bourgeoisie avait  été battue  par l'économie  politique  de la classe  ouvrière. 
Mais  il  était  réservé  à  l'économie  politique  du  Travail  de  remporter  bientôt  un 
triomphe  plus  complet  encore  sur  l'économie  politique  du  Capital.  Nous  voulons 
parler  du  mouvement  coopératif  et  surtout  des  manufactures  coopératives  créées 
par  l'initiative  isolée  de  quelques  «bras»  entreprenants.  La  valeur  de  ces  grandes 
expériences  sociales  ne  saurait  être  surfaite.  Elles  ont  montré  par  des  faits,  non  plus 
par  de  simples  arguments,  que  la  production  sur  une  grande  échelle  et  au  niveau 
des  exigences  de  la  science  moderne  pouvait  se  passer  d'une  classe  de  patrons  em 
ployant une  classe  de  bras ;  elles  ont  montré  qu'il n'était pas  nécessaire  à  la produc 
tion  de  la  richesse  que  l'instrument  de  travail  fût  monopolisé  et servît  ainsi  d'ins 
trument  de  domination  et  d'extorsion  contre  le  travailleur  lui-même;  elles  ont 
montré  que,  comme  le  travail  esclave,  comme  le  ||12|  travail  serf,  le  travail  salarié 
n'était qu'une  forme transitoire  et  inférieure,  destinée  à  disparaître  devant le  travail 
associé  apportant  à  sa  tâche  un  bras  ferme,  un  esprit  dispos,  un  cœur joyeux.  En 
Angleterre,  c'est  Robert  Owen  qui jeta  les  germes  du  système  coopératif;  les  entre 
prises  des  ouvriers,  tentées  sur le  continent,  ne  furent  en  fait  que  la  réalisation  pra 
tique  des  théories,  non  découvertes,  mais  hautement  proclamées  en  1848. 

En  même  temps  l'expérience  de  cette  période  (1848  à  64)  a  prouvé jusqu'à  l'évi 
dence  que,  si  excellent  qu'il  fût  en  principe,  si  utile  qu'il  se  montrât  dans  l'applica 
tion,  le  travail  coopératif  limité  étroitement  aux  efforts  accidentels  et  particuliers 

620 

Manifeste  de  l'Association  Internationale  des  Travailleurs  (Adresse  inaugurale) 

des  ouvriers,  ne  pourra  jamais  arrêter  le  développement,  en  proportion  géométri 
que,  du  monopole,  ni  affranchir les  masses,  ni  même  alléger  un  tant  soit peu  le  far 
deau  de  leurs  misères.  C'est  peut-être  précisément  le  motif qui  a  décidé  de  grands 
seigneurs  spécieux,  des  philanthropes  bourgeois  et  même  des  économistes  pointus 
à  accabler  tout  à  coup  d'éloges  affadissants  ce  système  coopératif  qu'ils  avaient  en 
vain  essayé  d'écraser,  lorsqu'il  venait  à  peine  d'éclore,  ce  système  coopératif qu'ils 
représentaient  alors  d'un  ton  railleur  comme  une  utopie  de  rêveur,  ou  qu'ils  ana-
thématisaient  comme  un  sacrilège  de  socialiste. 

Pour  affranchir  les  masses  travailleuses,  la  coopération  doit  atteindre  un  dévelop 
pement  national  et,  par  conséquent,  être  soutenue  et  propagée  par  des  moyens  na 
tionaux.  Mais  les  seigneurs  de  la  terre  et  les  seigneurs  du  capital  se  serviront  tou 
jours  de  leurs  privilèges  politiques  pour  défendre  et  perpétuer  leurs  privilèges 
économiques.  Bien  loin  de pousser à  l'émancipation  du  travail,  ils  continueront  à y 
opposer  le  plus  d'obstacles  possibles.  Qu'on  se  rappelle  avec  quel  dédain  lord  Pal-
merston  rembarra  les  défenseurs  du  bill  sur  les  droits  des  tenanciers  irlandais,  pré 
senté  pendant  cette  session  (1864):  «La  Chambre  des  Communes,  s'écria-t-il,  est 
une  chambre  de  propriétaires  fonciers ! » 

La  conquête  du  pouvoir politique  est  donc  devenue  le  premier devoir de  la  classe 
ouvrière.  Elle  semble l'avoir compris,  car en Angleterre,  en Allemagne,  en Italie,  en 
France,  on  a  vu  renaître  en  même  temps  ces  aspirations  ||13|  communes,  et  en 
même  temps  aussi  des  efforts  ont  été  faits  pour  réorganiser  politiquement  le  parti 
des  travailleurs. 

Il est un  élément  de  succès  que  ce  parti possède :  il a le  nombre ;  mais  le  nombre 
ne pèse  dans  la  balance  que  s'il  est uni  par l'association  et  guidé  par le  savoir.  L'ex 
périence  du  passé  nous  a  appris  comment l'oubli  de  ces  liens fraternels  qui  doivent 
exister entre  les travailleurs  des  différents  pays  et  les  exciter à  se  soutenir les uns  les 
autres  dans  toutes  leurs  luttes  pour l'affranchissement,  sera  puni  par la  défaite  com 
mune  de  leurs  entreprises  divisées.  C'est  poussés  par  cette  pensée  que  les  travail 
leurs  de  différents  pays,  réunis  en  un  meeting  public  à  Saint-Martin's  hall,  le 
28  septembre  1864,  ont  résolu  de  fonder  l'Association  internationale. 

Une  autre  conviction  encore  a  inspiré  ce  meeting. 
Si  l'affranchissement  des  travailleurs  demande,  pour  être  assuré,  leur  concours 
fraternel,  comment  peuvent-ils  remplir cette  grande  mission,  si une  politique  étran 
gère,  mue  par  de  criminels  desseins  et  mettant  en  jeu  les  préjugés  nationaux,  ré 
pand  dans  des  guerres  de  pirates  le  sang  et  l'argent  du  peuple?  Ce  n'est  pas  la  pru 
dence  des  classes  gouvernantes  de  l'Angleterre,  mais  bien  l'opposition  de  la  classe 
ouvrière  à  leur  criminelle  folie,  qui  a  épargné  à  l'Europe  occidentale  l'infamie 
d'une  croisade  pour  le  maintien  et  le  développement  de  l'esclavage  de  l'autre  côté 
de  l'Océan.  L'approbation  sans  pudeur,  la  sympathie  dérisoire  ou  l'indifférence 
idiote,  avec  lesquelles  les  classes  supérieures  d'Europe  ont  vu  la  Russie  saisir 
comme  une  proie  les montagnes-forteresses  du  Caucase  et  assassiner l'héroïque  Po 
logne,  les  empiétements  immenses  et  sans  obstacles  de  cette  puissance  barbare 
dont  la  tête  est  à  Saint-Pétersbourg  et  dont  on  retrouve  la  main  dans  tous  les  cabi 
nets  d'Europe,  ont  appris  aux  travailleurs  qu'il  leur  fallait  se  mettre  au  courant  des 
mystères  de  la  politique  internationale,  surveiller  la  conduite  diplomatique  de  leurs

voir  et  enfin,  lorsqu'ils  seraient  impuissants  à  rien  empêcher,  s'entendre  pour  une

|14|vent gouverner  les  relations  des  individus,  comme  la  règle  suprême  des  rapports 
entre  les  nations. 

Combattre  pour  une  politique  étrangère  de  cette  nature,  c'est  prendre  part  à  la

Considérant : 

« 

Que  l'émancipation  des  travailleurs  doit  être  l'œuvre  des  travailleurs  eux-
mêmes ;  que  les  efforts  des  travailleurs  pour  conquérir  leur  émancipation  ne  doi-

droits  et  des  devoirs  égaux  et  anéantir  la  domination  de  toute  classe ; 

Que  l'assujettissement  économique  du  travailleur  aux  détenteurs  des  moyens  de 
travail,  c'est-à-dire des  sources de la vie,  est la cause première  de sa servitude politi 
que,  morale,  matérielle; 

0 

Que  l'émancipation  économique  des  travailleurs  est  conséquemment  le  grand 

but  auquel  tout  mouvement  politique  doit  être  subordonné  comme  moyen ; 

Que  tous  les  efforts  faits  jusqu'ici  ont  échoué,  faute  de  solidarité  entre  les 
ouvriers  des  diverses  professions  dans  chaque  pays,  et  d'une  union  fraternelle  entre 
les  travailleurs  des  diverses  contrées ; 

15 

Que  l'émancipation  du  travail n'étant  un  problème  ni local  ni national,  mais  so 
cial,  embrasse  tous les pays  dans  lesquels  la vie moderne  existe  et nécessite  pour sa 
solution  leur  concours  théorique  et  pratique ; |

immédiatement  leurs  efforts  encore  isolés; 

Par  ces  raisons : 
Les  soussignés,  membres  du  Conseil  élu  par  l'Assemblée  tenue  le  28  septembre 
1864,  à  Saint-Martin's  Hall,  à  Londres,  ont  pris  les  mesures  nécessaires  pour  fon-

Ils  déclarent  que  cette  Association  internationale  ainsi  que  toutes  les  sociétés  ou 
individus  y  adhérant  reconnaîtront  comme  devant  être  la  base  de  leur  conduite  en-
•·'  vers tous les hommes :  la  Vérité,  la Justice,  la Morale,  sans  distinction de  couleur,  de

Ils  considèrent comme  un devoir de  réclamer pour tous  les  droits  d'homme  et  de 

30 
f.  citoyen.  Pas  de  devoirs  sans  droits. 

C'est dans cet esprit qu'ils ont rédigé le règlement provisoire de Y Association inter-

623 

Karl  Marx 

Art. 1e r.  Une  association  est  établie  pour  procurer  un  point  central  de  communi 
cation  et  de  coopération  entre  les  ouvriers  des  différents  pays  aspirant  au  même 
but,  savoir :  le  Concours  mutuel,  le  Progrès  et  le  complet  Affranchissement  de  la 
classe  ouvrière. 

Art.2.  Le nom  de cette Association sera: Association internationale des Travailleurs. 
Art. 3.  En  1866  aura  lieu  la réunion d'un Congrès général.  Ce  Congrès  devra faire 
connaître  à  l'Europe  les  communes  aspirations  des  ouvriers.  Arrêter  le  règlement 
définitif de  l'Association  internationale.  Examiner  les  meilleurs  moyens  pour  assu 
rer  le  succès  de  son  travail  et  élire  ||17|  le  Conseil  central  de  l'Association.  Le 
Congrès  se  réunira  une  fois  l'an. 

Art. 4.  Le  Conseil  central  siégera  à  Londres  et  se  composera  d'ouvriers  représen 
tant  les  différentes  nations  faisant  partie  de  l'Association  internationale.  Il  prendra 
dans  son  sein,  selon  les  besoins  de  l'Association,  les  membres  du  bureau,  tels  que 
Président,  Secrétaire  général,  Trésorier  et  Secrétaires  particuliers  pour  les  différents 
pays. 

Art. 5.  A  chaque  Congrès  annuel,  le  Conseil  général  fera  un  rapport  public  des 
travaux  de  l'année.  En  cas  d'urgence,  il  pourra  convoquer le  Congrès  avant  le  terme 
fixé. 

Art. 6.  Le  conseil  général  établira  des  relations  avec  les  différentes  associations 
d'ouvriers,  de  telle  sorte  que  les  ouvriers  de  chaque  pays  soient  constamment  au 
courant  des  mouvements  de  leur  classe  dans  les  autres  pays ;  Qu'une  enquête  sur 
l'état  social  soit  faite  simultanément  et  dans  un  même  esprit;  -  Que  les  questions 
proposées  par une  Société,  et dont la  discussion  est  d'un  intérêt général,  soient exa 
minées  par  toutes,  et  que  lorsqu'une  idée  pratique  ou  une  difficulté  internationale. 
réclamerait  l'action  de  l'Association,  celle-ci  puisse  agir  d'une  manière  uniforme. 
Lorsque  cela  lui  semblera  nécessaire,  le  Conseil  central  prendra  l'initiative  des  pro? 
positions  à  soumettre  aux  Sociétés  locales  ou  nationales. 

Art. 7.  Puisque  le  succès  du  mouvement  ouvrier  ne  peut  être  assuré  dans  chaque 
pays  que  par  la  force  résultant  de  l'union  et  de  l'association ;  -  que,  d'autre  part, 
l'utilité  du  Conseil  central  dépend  de  ses  rapports  avec  les  sociétés  ouvrières,  soit 
nationales  ou  locales,  les  membres  de  l'Association  internationale  devront  faire 
tous  leurs  efforts,  chacun  dans  son  pays,  pour  réunir  en  une  association  nationale 
les  diverses  sociétés  d'ouvriers  existantes,  ainsi  que  pour  créer un  organe  spécial. 

Il  est  sous-entendu  cependant  que  l'application  de  cet  article  dépendra  des  lois 
particulières  de  chaque  pays  et  que,  abstraction  faite  de  ces  obstacles  légaux,  cha 
que  Société  locale  indépendante  aura  le  droit  de  correspondre  directement  avec  le 
Conseil  central  de  Londres. | 

|18|  Art. 8.  Jusqu'à la première réunion  du  Congrès  ouvrier,  le  Conseil  élu  en sep 
tembre  agira  comme  Conseil  central  provisoire.  Il  essaiera  de  mettre  en  communi 
cation  les  Sociétés  ouvrières  de  tous  pays.  Il  groupera  les  membres  du  Royaume-
Uni.  Il  prendra  les  mesures  provisoires  pour  la  convocation  du  Congrès  général,  il 
discutera  avec  les  Sociétés  locales  ou  nationales  les  questions  qui  devront  être  po 
sées  devant  le  Congrès. 

Art. 9.  Chaque membre  de  l'Association  internationale,  en changeant de  pays, re 

cevra  l'appui  fraternel  des  membres  de  l'Association.

Aperçu  sur  la  marche  de  l'Association  internationale 
des  travailleurs. 

L'assemblée  fondatrice  de  Y  Association  internationale  des  travailleurs  s'est  tenue  le 
28  septembre  1864,  à Londres,  dans «St-Martin's  Hall».  Cette  assemblée  était com 
posée  des  représentants  des  principales  nations  européennes  (Allemagne,  Pologne, 
Suisse,  France,  Belgique,  Italie).  On  élut  provisoirement  un  comité  central  chargé 
de  rédiger  le  manifeste,  d'élaborer  le  règlement  et  de  constituer  des  groupes  dans 
toute  l'Europe. 

Nous  voulons  aujourd'hui,  avant  le  congrès,  porter  à  la  connaissance  de  tous  les 
membres  de  Y  Association  et  de  tous  ceux  qui  ne  se  sont  pas  encore  joints  à  elle,  un 
aperçu  des  progrès  accomplis. 

Angleterre. 

Un  grand  nombre  de  sociétés  ouvrières  anglaises( 1)  ont  adhéré  aux  principes,  et  se 
sont jointes à Y Association internationale (société des poseurs de briques, des cordon 
niers,  des  ébénistes,  des  tailleurs,  etc  ...). 

En  ce  moment,  les  sociétés  des  charpentiers,  des  tonneliers,  des  menuisiers,  etc., 

sont  prêtes  à  se joindre. 

Le  mouvement  réformiste  a  absorbé  pendant  un  moment  toute  l'attention  de  la 
classe  ouvrière  et  toute  l'activité  du  conseil  central.  Mais  depuis  quelque  temps  des 
deputations,  émanant  du  conseil  central,  sont  envoyées  dans  toutes  les  sociétés 
ouvrières pour leur faire  connaître  les principes,  et les prier de  se joindre.  Ces depu 
tations  sont  partout  accueillies  chaleureusement. 

A  Londres,  le  conseil  central  a  fondé  un journal,  le  Commonwealth,  qui  est  deve 

nu  son  organe  officiel. 

( 1) Le lecteur ne doit pas oublier que la classe ouvrière anglaise est en partie organisée. En ef 
fet, les sociétés (Trade-Unions) comprennent dans leur sein tous les membres d'une même in 
dustrie.  Quelques-unes  de  ces  sociétés  se  composent  d'un  nombre  considérable  d'hommes, 
celle des  cordonniers  compte  5000 membres environ. 

626 

Aperçu  sur  la  marche  de  l'Association  Internationale  des  Travailleurs 

Une  branche  allemande  et  une  branche  française  de  l'Association  internationale 

ont  été  formées. 

Mais  son  plus  grand  titre  à  l'attention  publique  est  d'avoir  réveillé  et  entretenu 
dans  la  classe  ouvrière  anglaise  la  conscience  de  sa  force  politique,  sentiment 
qu'elle  avait  perdu  depuis  la  réaction  de  48,  comme  le  constate  le  manifeste.  L'im 
pulsion  qu'elle  a  donnée  dans  ce  sens  a  été  si  considérable  que  la  société  des  cor 
donniers  a  effacé  de  ses  statuts  l'article  qui  leur défendait  de  s'occuper  de  politique, 
celle  des  maçons  est  en  train  de  faire  de  même. 

C'est  l'Association  internationale  qui  a  fait  persévérer  les  ouvriers  dans  leur politi 
que  anti-esclavagiste,  lors  de  la  guerre  américaine.  C'est  elle,  l'une  des  premières 
qui  adressa  une  lettre  de  felicitation  à  Lincoln,  à  cause  de  sa  réélection.  Lincoln  a 
répondu  et  a  engagé  fortement  les  membres  à  continuer leur mouvement  d'union  et 
de  concorde.  -  L'Association  a  pris  l'initiative  du  mouvement  de  la  «Reform-lea-
gue».  Après  le  premier  meeting  réformiste,  un  comité  organisateur  et  agitateur  fut 
nommé,  il  était  composé  de  27  membres  dont  24  appartenaient  au  conseil  central 
et ce sont eux  qui  ont réclamé le suffrage universel.  Pendant que  toute  la presse  an 
glaise  battait  des  mains  et  approuvait  la  conduite  du  gouvernement  contre  les  fé-
nians,  le  Commonwealth  seul  osa  élever  la  voix  et  les  défendre.  Le  conseil  central 
envoya  même  au  secrétaire  d'État  une  requête  pour  obtenir  une  entrevue  avec  le 
ministre,  dans  le  but  de  demander  un  adoucissement  dans  le  sort  des  prisonniers. 
L'entrevue  fut  refusée. 

L'Association  internationale  a  dernièrement  remporté  un  succès  qui  a  modifié  à 
son  égard  l'opinion  de  la  presse.  Les  ouvriers  tailleurs  avaient  été  mis  dehors  (lock 
out)  par leurs  patrons0',  qui  immédiatement  envoyèrent  des  agents  sur le  continent 
pour  recruter  des  ouvriers.  Le  conseil  central  prévint  ses  correspondants  qui,  par 
des communications,  soit  verbales,  soit par la  voie  de  la presse,  déjouèrent  les  pro 
jets  des  patrons.  Cependant  un  certain  nombre  d'ouvriers  allemands  venus  des 
villes  où  l'Association  internationale  n'avait  pas  de  membres,  arrivèrent  à  Edim 
bourg.  Deux  de  leurs  compatriotes  leur  furent  envoyés  de  Londres,  et  à  leur  retour 
ils firent un  rapport  au  conseil  central  et  lui  annoncèrent  leur  départ,  ce  qui  arriva 
en  effet  quelques  jours  après( 2 ). 

Suisse. 

C'est  surtout  en  Suisse  que  l'Association  internationale  a  pu  se  généraliser  le  plus 
promptement  et  arriver  à  des  résultats  positifs.  Elle  a  fondé  des  groupes  dans  pres 
que  toutes  les  villes  de  la  Suisse :  Genève,  Lausanne,  Vevey,  Montreux,  la  Chaux-
de-Fonds,  St-Imier,  Sonvilliers,  Porrentruy,  Bienne,  Bale,  Zurich,  Aubonne,  Wetzi-
kon,  etc. 

( 1) En Angleterre les patrons comme les ouvriers font grève. Ils ferment leurs ateliers et jettent 
sur le  pavé  leurs  misérables  employés.  C'est  ce  qui  se  passe  présentement  à  Sheffield,  les

L'Association  internationale  est propriétaire  de  trois journaux,  deux  écrits  en fran 
çais,  la  Voix  de  l'Avenir,  le  Journal de  l'Association  internationale,  et  un  en  allemand, 
le  Vorbote  (Précurseur).  Tous  les journaux  suisses  ont  mis  leur publicité  au  service 
de  l'Association. 

A  Lausanne,  les  membres  de  l'Association  ont  entrepris  l'hiver  dernier  des  tra 
vaux  pour  l'État,  environ  pour  24 000  francs,  dans  le  but  de  fournir  du  travail  aux 
ouvriers  pendant  la  mauvaise  saison.  Le  chantier  spécialement  dirigé  par  des 
ouvriers,  sans  l'intervention  d'aucun  patron,  faisait  l'étonnement  des  visiteurs  et 
des  autorités  de  la  ville.  Ils  ont  fondé  une  banque  nommée  la  Caisse  du  crédit mu 
tuel,  dont  le  capital  de  20 000  francs  est  divisé  en  actions  de  5  francs.  -  Un  cercle 
d'ouvriers  a  été  créé. 

A  La  Chaux-de-Fonds,  une  boulangerie  coopérative  a  été  établie,  et une  bouche 
rie  coopérative  est  annoncée.  A  peine  la  boulangerie  inaugurée,  les  boulangers 
abaissèrent  le  prix  du  pain  à  0,16  c.  la  livre.  Le  projet  de  boucherie  coopérative 
n'est  pas  resté  sans  effet  sur  le  prix  de  la  viande ;  les  bouchers  l'ont  réduit  déjà  de 
0,09  c. 

A Genève,  une  société  de  consommation  est en  train  de  s'organiser.  A Lausanne, 
on  a  décidé  de  créer  des  fonds  pour  la  construction  de  maisons  ouvrières,  analogue 
au  familistère  de  Guise,  près  Paris. 

A l l e m a g n e. 

L'Association  internationale  en  Allemagne,  comme  en  France,  n'a  pas  pu  prendre 
une  grande  extension,  grâce  au  manque  de  liberté !  Elle  a  pu  cependant  former des 
groupes  à  Leipzig,  Magdebourg,  Hanovre,  Mayence,  Berlin,  Peterswaldau,  Solin 
gen,  Langenbielau,  Pinneberg,  Wuste-Giersdorf,  Emsdorf,  etc. 

Depuis  les  approches  de  la  guerre,  plus  de  liberté  ayant  été  laissée,  l'Association 
est  en  train  de  prospérer.  Tous  les  principaux  chefs  du  mouvement  ouvrier  alle 
mand  [dans  la  Saxe]  ont  adhéré  aux  principes  et  s'occupent  activement  de  les  pro 
pager. 

F r a n c e. 

L'Association  internationale  a  des  groupes  dans  différentes  villes:  Paris,  Lyon,  Bor 
deaux,  Caen,  Neufchâteau,  Argentan,  Rennes,  Rouen, Granville,  etc.,  etc. 

Quoiqu'elle  soit  peu  développée,  elle  a  rendu  un  service  à  la  classe  ouvrière  à 
Lyon,  les  ouvriers  tullistes  étaient  en  grève,  ils  allaient  céder,  car  leurs  patrons  les 
menaçaient  de  faire  venir  des  ouvriers  anglais,  qu'on  payait  meilleur  marché  selon 
eux.  Les  ouvriers  s'informèrent  et  le  conseil  central  leur  répondit  que  tout  le 
contraire  avait  lieu;  ils  persévérèrent  et  obtinrent  leur  demande.

Belgique. 

plusieurs  groupes  se  sont  créés  à Bruxelles,  Anvers,  Liège,  Verviers,  Gand,  Namur, 
Patignies,  etc.  La  société  le  Peuple  s'est  fédérée  avec  Y  Association  internationale,  et 
son  organe  la  Tribune  du  Peuple  appartient  maintenant  à  l'Association. 

C'est  l'Association  qui,  dans  le  mouvement  réformiste  belge,  a  exercé  le  plus 
d'influence  et  par  ses  nombreux  meetings  a  nettement  placé  la  question  de  la  ré 
forme  sur  le  terrain  du  suffrage  universel.

La  lutte  sociale. 

Le  champ  est  envahi  par les ronces,  les  orties  et  autres plantes  malfaisantes.  L'épo 
que  de  la semaille  venue,  le  paysan  ne  s'amuse  pas  à les arracher une  à une  ou  à les 
couper  ras  de  terre.  -  Non.  -  Il  prend  sa  charrue,  l'enfonce  profondément  et  re 
tourne  le  champ  sens  dessus  dessous.  Les  ronces  et  les  orties  privées  d'air  et  de  so 
leil,  pourrissent,  engraissent  la  terre. 

Dans  notre  société  nous  trouvons  une  foule  de  produits  nuisibles,  parasitaires: 
magistrature,  clergé,  armée,  fonctionnarisme,  État,  etc.,  etc.  ...  Et  vous  voulez  que 
nous  entrions  en  composition  avec  chacune  de  ces  institutions  en  particulier.  -* 
Non.  -  L'heure  est  venue  d'aller  au  fond  et  au  tréfond  de  la  question ;  d'attaquer en 
face,  énergiquement,  la propriété  bourgeoise.  Elle  est la  base  de  tout  le  système ;  la 
cause  de  tous  les  maux.

La  question  économique  domine  tout ;  sa  solution  amène  fatalement  la  solution de  15^? 
toutes  les  autres  questions. 

L'antinomie  existe  dans  le  monde  social.  Les  classes  sont perpétuellement  en  an 

tagonisme,  la  bourgeoisie  contre  la  noblesse,  le  prolétariat  contre  la  bourgeoisie. 

Écoutons  l'éminent  socialiste  allemand  Karl  Marx  faisant  la  théorie  de  cet  anta 

gonisme : 

«La  féodalité  avait  aussi  son  prolétariat  -  le  servage  qui  renfermait  tous  les 
germes  de  la  bourgeoisie.  La  production  féodale  aussi  avait  deux  éléments  antago 
nistes  qu'on  désigne  sous  le nom de  bon côté  et de  mauvais côté  de  la féodalité,  sans 
considérer  que  c'est  toujours  le  mauvais  côté  qui  finit  par  l'emporter  sur  le  bon 
côté.  Le  mauvais  côté  produit  le  mouvement,  fait  l'histoire  en  établissant  la  lutte.  25*. 
Si  à  l'époque  du  règne  de  la  féodalité,  les  économistes  enthousiasmés  des  vertus 
chevaleresques,  de  la  bonne  harmonie  entre  les  droits  et  les  devoirs,  de  la  vie  pa 
triarcale  des  villes,  de  l'état  de  prospérité  de  l'industrie  domestique  dans  les  cam 
pagnes,  du  développement  de  l'industrie  organisée  par  corporations, jurandes,  maî-

trises,  enfin  de  tout  ce  qui  constitue  le  beau  côté  de  la  féodalité,  s'étaient  proposés 
d'éliminer  tout  ce  qui  faisait  ombre  au  tableau  -  servage,  privilèges,  anarchie  -
qu'en serait-il  arrivé?  On  aurait anéanti tous les  éléments  qui constituent la lutte  et 
étouffé  dans  son  germe  le  développement  de  la  bourgeoisie.  On  se  serait  posé  l'ab-
surde  problème  d'éliminer  l'histoire. 

;5 
I 
Lorsque  la  bourgeoisie  l'eut  emporté,  il  ne  fut  plus  question  ni  du  bon,  ni  du 
fr  mauvais  côté  de  la  féodalité.  Les  forces  productives  qui  s'étaient  développées  par 
elle  sous  la féodalité,  lui  furent  acquises.  Toutes  les  anciennes  forces  économiques, 
les  relations  civiles  qui  leur  correspondaient,  l'état  politique  qui  était  l'expression 

Í0  officielle  de  l'ancienne  société  civile,  étaient  brisées. 

·' 

Ainsi pour bien juger la production féodale,  il faut la  considérer comme  un mode 
de production  fondé  sur  l'antagonisme.  Il  faut  montrer  comment  la richesse  se  pro-
duisait  en  dedans  de  cet  antagonisme,  comment  les  forces  productives  se  dévelop 
paient  en même  temps  que  l'antagonisme  des  classes,  comment l'une  des  classes,  le 
]5  mauvais  côté,  l'inconvénient  de  la  société,  allait  toujours  croissant jusqu'à  ce  que 
les  conditions  matérielles  de  son  émancipation  fussent  arrivées  au  point  de  matu 
rité.  N'est-ce  pas  due  assez  que  le  mode  de  production,  les  rapports  dans  lesquels 
les  forces  productives  se  développent,  ne  sont  rien  moins  que  des  lois  étemelles, 
mais  qu'ils  correspondent  à  un  développement  déterminé  des  hommes  et  de  leurs 
forces  productives  et  qu'un  changement  survenu  dans  les  forces  productives  des 
hommes  amène  nécessairement  un  changement  dans  les  rapports  de  production? 
Comme  il  importe  avant  tout  de  ne  pas  être  privé  des  fruits  de  la  civilisation,  des 
forces  productives  acquises,  il faut  briser  les  formes  traditionnelles  dans  lesquelles 
elles  ont  été  produites.  Dès  ce  moment  la  classe  révolutionnaire  devient  conserva-

,  ' 

25  trice. 

La  bourgeoisie  commence  avec un prolétariat  qui  lui-même  est un reste  du prolé 
tariat  des  temps  féodaux.  Dans  le  cours  de  son  développement  historique,  son  ca 
ractère  antagoniste  se  trouve  au  début  plus  ou  moins  déguisé,  et n'existe  qu'à  l'état 
latent.  A mesure  que  la bourgeoisie  se  développe,  il se  développe  dans  son  sein,  un 
•30  nouveau  prolétariat,  un  prolétariat  moderne,  il  se  développe  une  lutte  entre  la 
classe  prolétaire  et la  classe bourgeoise,  lutte qui  avant d'être  sentie  des deux  côtés, 
aperçue,  appréciée,  comprise,  avouée  et  hautement  proclamée,  ne  se  manifeste  que 
par  des  conflits  partiels  et  momentanés,  par  des  faits  subversifs.  D'un  autre  côté  si 
tous  les  membres  de  la  bourgeoisie  ont  le  même  intérêt  en  tant  qu'ils  forment  une 
; 35  classe vis-à-vis  des autres  classes,  ils ont des intérêts opposés,  antagonistes,  en tant 
qu'ils  se  trouvent les  uns  vis-à-vis  des  autres.  Cette  opposition  des  intérêts  découle 
des  conditions  économiques  de  leur vie  bourgeoise.  De jour  en jour  il  devient  donc 
plus  clair que  les  rapports  de  production  dans  lesquels  se  meut  la  bourgeoisie  n'ont 
pas  un  caractère  un,  un  caractère  simple,  mais  un  caractère  de  duplicité,  que  dans 
les  mêmes  rapports  dans  lesquels  se  produit  la  richesse,  la  misère  se  produit  aussi, 
que  dans  les  mêmes  rapports  dans  lesquels  il  y  a  développement  de  forces  produc 
tives,  il y  a une  force  productive  de répression ;  que  ces  rapports  ne produisent  la  ri 
chesse  bourgeoise  c'est-à-dire  la  richesse  de  la  classe  bourgeoise  qu'en  anéantissant 
continuellement la richesse  des  membres  intégrants  de  cette  classe  et en produisant

Paul  Lafargue 

Tant  que  le  prolétariat  n'est  pas  encore  assez  développé  pour  se  constituer  en 
classe,  que  par  conséquent  la  lutte  même  du  prolétariat  avec  la  bourgeoisie  n'a pas 
encore  un  caractère  politique  et  que  les  forces  productives  ne  sont  pas  encore  assez 
développées  dans  le  sein  de  la  bourgeoisie  elle-même,  pour  laisser  entrevoir  les 
conditions  matérielles,  nécessaires  à  l'affranchissement  du  prolétariat  et  à  la  forma 
tion  d'une  société  nouvelle,  ses  théoriciens  (les  socialistes  et  les  communistes)  ne 
sont  que  des  utopistes  qui  pour  obvier  aux  besoins  des  classes  opprimées  improvi 
sent  des  systèmes.  Mais  à  mesure  que  l'histoire  marche  et  qu'avec  elle  la  lutte  du 
prolétariat  se  dessine  plus  nettement,  ils  n'ont plus besoin  de  chercher de  la  science 
dans  leur  esprit,  ils  n'ont  qu'à  se  rendre  compte  de  ce  qui  se  passe  devant  leurs 
yeux  et  de  s'en  faire  l'organe.  Tant  qu'ils  cherchent  la  science  et  ne  font  que  des 
systèmes,  tant  qu'ils  sont  au  début  de  la  lutte,  ils  ne  voient  dans  la  misère  que  la 
misère,  sans  y  voir  le  côté  révolutionnaire  subversif,  qui  renversera  la  société  an 
cienne.  Dès  ce  moment,  la  science  produite  par  le  mouvement  historique  et  s'y  as 
sociant  en pleine  connaissance  de  cause,  a  cessé  d'être  doctrinaire,  elle  est  devenue 
révolutionnaire0 1. » 

La  lutte  des  classes  est  donc  une  des  conditions  du  mouvement  historique.

Le Courrier International. 
Nr. 6/7,  16. Februar 1867 

Rapport  du  conseil central. 
Sur  les  différentes  questions  mises  à  l'étude 
par la  conférence  de  septembre  1865. 

1.  -  Organisation  de  l'Association. 

Le  conseil  provisoire  de  Londres  recommande  le  plan  d'organisation  comme  il  est 
tracé  dans  les  statuts  provisoires.  L'expérience  de  deux  ans  a prouvé  sa  force  et  sa 
facilité  d'adaptation  aux  circonstances  particulières  des  différentes  contrées,  sans 
entraver  toutefois  l'unité  d'action.  Pour  l'année  prochaine,  nous  recommandons 
Londres  comme  le  siège  du  conseil  central.  La  situation  politique  du  continent 
rendant  impossible  tout  changement. 

Les membres du  conseil central seront élus par le  congrès (art. 5  des statuts provi 

soires)  et  auront  cependant  le  droit  de  s'adjoindre  de  nouveaux  membres. 

Le  secrétaire général sera  choisi par le  congrès  (pour un  an)  et sera le  seul membre 
payé  de  l'Association.  Nous proposons  deux livres  sterling  (50 fr.)  par semaine  pour 
son  salaire. 

Le  comité permanent  formant  en  fait  l'exécutif du  conseil  central,  sera  choisi  par 
le  congrès ;  la  fonction  de  chacun  de  ses  membres  sera  déterminée  par  le  conseil 
central. 

Comme  contribution  annuelle  et  uniforme  que  doit  payer  chaque  membre  de  l'Asso 
ciation  à  la  caisse  du  conseil  central,  nous  recommandons  un  sou  (peut-être  deux 
sous).  Le  prix  des  cartes  ou  livrets  sera payé  en  sous. 

Quoique  conseillant  aux  membres  de  l'Association  de  former  des  sociétés  de  se 
cours  mutuels  et  d'établir  un  lien  international  entre  ces  sociétés,  nous  laissons 
l'initiative de ces questions  («établissement des  sociétés de secours mutuels. Appui 
moral et matériel accordé  aux orphelins de  l'Association,»)  aux  Suisses,  qui les ont 
proposées  aux  conférences  de  septembre.

2.  -  C o m b i n a i s on  i n t e r n a t i o n a le  des  efforts, 
par  le  m o y en  de  l'association,  p o ur  la  lutte  du  travail 
contre  le  capital. 

a. D'un  point  de  vue  général,  cette  question  embrasse  toute  l'activité  de  l'Asso 
ciation  internationale,  dont  le  but  est  de  combiner,  de  généraliser  et  de  donner  de 
l'uniformité  aux  efforts,  encore  désunis,  accomplis  dans  les  différentes  contrées 
pour  l'émancipation  de  la  classe  ouvrière. 

b. Une  des  principales  fonctions  de  l'Association,  fonction  remplie  déjà  avec 
grand  succès  dans  différentes  circonstances,  est  de  contrecarrer les  intrigues  des  ca 
pitalistes,  toujours prêts,  dans  les  cas  de  grèves  ou  de  fermeture  d'ateliers  (lock-out) 
à user  des  ouvriers  étrangers  comme  instrument  pour  étouffer les justes  plaintes  des 
travailleurs  indigènes.  C'est un  des grands  buts  de  l'Association  de  développer chez 
les  ouvriers  des  différents  pays  non-seulement  le  sentiment  mais  le  fait  de  leur  fra 
ternité  et  de  les  unir  pour  former  l'armée  de  l'émancipation. 

c. Nous  proposons  à  l'adoption  du  congrès,  comme  une  «grande  combinaison 
d'efforts»,  une  statistique des  conditions  des classes ouvrières de  toutes les contrées faite 
par  les  ouvriers  eux-mêmes.  Evidemment,  pour  agir  avec  quelque  chance  de  succès, 
on  doit  connaître  les  matériaux  sur  lesquels  on  veut  agir.  En  même  temps  les  tra 
vailleurs,  en  prenant  l'initiative  d'un  si  grand  ouvrage,  montreront  qu'ils  sont  ca 
pables  de  tenir  leurs  destinées  entre  leurs  mains.  C'est  pourquoi  nous  proposons : 
Que  dans  chaque  localité  où  i]  existe  des  branches  de  notre  Association,  le  tra 
vail  doit  être  commencé  immédiatement  et  les  faits  doivent  être  rassemblés  sur  les 
différents  sujets  spécifiés  dans  le  sommaire  ci-joint : 

Que  le  congrès  appelle  tous  les  ouvriers  de  l'Europe  et  d'Amérique  à  collaborer, 

en  ramassant  les  éléments  de  cette  statistique  sur  la  classe  ouvrière ; 
Que  les  rapports  et  les  faits  soient  envoyés  au  conseil  central ; 
Que  le  conseil  central  les  condense  en  un  rapport  et  le  fasse  suivre  d'un  appen 

dice  contenant  les  faits ; 

Que  ce  rapport  et  cet  appendice  soient  prêts  pour  le  prochain  congrès,  et 

qu'après  en  avoir  reçu  la  sanction  il  soit  publié  aux  frais  de  l'Association. 

Sommaire  général  de  l'enquête.  (Il  peut  être  étendu  suivant  les  besoins  de  chaque 
localité.)

distribue  avec  plus  ou  moins  d'uniformité  pendant  toute  l'année.  S'il  y  a  de 
grandes  fluctuations  de prospérité  et de stagnation ;  si  elle  est exposée  à la  con 
currence  étrangère.  Si  elle  produit  généralement  pour  le  marché  intérieur  ou 
pour  le  marché  étranger,  etc. 

3.  R é d u c t i on  des  heures  de  travail. 

Nous  considérons  la  réduction  des  heures  de  travail  comme  la  condition  prélimi 
naire  sans  laquelle  toutes  les  tentatives  ultérieures  d'amélioration  et  d'émancipa 
tion  avorteront.  Il  faut  rétablir  l'énergie  et  la  santé  des  classes  laborieuses,  qui  for 
ment le véritable  corps  de  la nation.  Il n'est pas moins nécessaire  de leur fournir la 
possibilité du développement intellectuel,  des relations sociales  et de l'activité  poli 
tique  et  sociale. 

Nous  proposons  huit  heures  de  travail  comme  limite  légale  du  jour  de  travail. 
Cette limite  étant généralement  demandée  par les  ouvriers  des  Etats-Unis  d'Améri 
que ;  le  vote  du  congrès  en  fera  l'étendard  commun  de  toutes  les  réclamations  des 
classes  ouvrières  de  l'univers. 

Pour l'instruction des membres  continentaux,  dont l'expérience  sur les  lois  régis 
sant  les  fabriques  est  d'une  date  plus  récente  que  celle  des  ouvriers  anglais,  nous 
ajoutons  que toute loi pour la limitation  de la journée  de travail avortera  et sera bri 
sée  par  les  capitalistes  si  la  période  de jour  pendant  laquelle  les  huit  heures  de  tra 
vail  doivent  être  prises  n'est pas  déterminée.  La longueur de  cette  période  doit  être 
portée  à  huit  heures  avec  l'addition  des  heures  de  repos.  Par  exemple,  si  les  diffé 
rentes interruptions pour les repas s'élèvent à une heure, la période légale du jour doit 
être  limitée  à  neuf heures.  De  sept  heures  du  matin  à  quatre  hemes  du  soir  ou  de 
huit  heures  du  matin  à  cinq  heures  du  soir,  etc. 

Le  travail  de  nuit  doit  être  exceptionnellement  permis  dans  certaines  industries 

spécifiées  par  la  loi.  La  loi  doit  tendre  à  supprimer  tout travail  de  nuit. 

Cette  limitation  des  heures  de  travail  regarde  seulement  les  adultes  des  deux  se 
xes.  Les  femmes  cependant  doivent  être  rigoureusement  exclues  de  n'importe  quel 
travail  de  nuit,  et  de  toute  sorte  de  travail  où  la  pudeur  serait  blessée  et  où  leurs 
corps  seraient  exposés  à  des  poisons  ou  à  d'autres  agents  délétères. 

Nous  proposons  de  considérer  comme  adulte  toute  personne  ayant  atteint  l'âge 

de  dix-huit  ans.

4.  -  Travail  des  j e u n es  personnes 
et  des  enfants  des  d e ux  sexes. 

Nous  considérons  la  tendance  de  l'industrie  moderne  à  faire  co-opérer  les  enfants 
et  les jeunes  personnes  des  deux  sexes  dans  le  grand  mouvement  de  la  production 
sociale  comme  un  progrès  et  une  tendance  légitime,  quoique  la  manière  dans  la 
quelle  cette  tendance  est  réalisée  sous  le  joug  du  capital  soit  une  abomination. 
Dans une  société  rationnelle  n'importe quel enfant,  dès l'âge  de neuf ans,  doit  être un 
travailleur  productif,  de  même  qu'un  adulte  ne  peut  s'exempter  de  la  loi  générale 
de  la  nature :  «qui  ne  travaille pas  ne  mange pas. »  Mais  en  disant  travail,  nous  vou 
lons  parler  surtout  du  travail  manuel.  Néanmoins,  à  l'heure  présente,  nous  n'avons 
à  nous  occuper  que  des  enfants  et  des  jeunes  gens  des  classes  ouvrières. 

A  cause  de  raisons  physiologiques,  nous  jugeons  convenable  de  diviser  les  en 
fants  et  les jeunes  personnes  des  deux  sexes  en  trois  classes,  qui  doivent  être  trai 
tées  différemment.  La  première  classe  comprend  les  enfants  de  9  à  12  ans,  la  se 
conde classe,  de  12  à  15  ans,  et la troisième  classe,  de  15  à  18  ans.  Nous proposons 
que  l'emploi  de  la  première  classe  dans  tout  travail,  soit  dans  les  fabriques  ou  les 
maisons  particulières,  soit  légalement  restreint  à  deux  heures,  la  seconde,  à  quatre, 
et  la  troisième,  à  six.  Pour la  troisième  classe,  il  doit y  avoir une  interruption  d'une 
heure  au  moins  pour  le  repas  et  la  récréation. 

Il  serait  désirable  que  les  écoles  élémentaires  commençassent  l'instruction  des 
enfants  avant  l'âge  de  9  ans;  mais  pour  le  moment  nous  n'avons  qu'à  songer  aux 
mesures  absolument  réclamées  pour  contrecarrer  les  tendances  d'un  système  social 
qui  dégrade  l'ouvrier  au  point  de  le  rendre  un  simple  instrument  pour  l'accumula 
tion  du  capital  et  qui  transforme  les  parents  en  des  marchands  d'esclaves,  en  leur 
faisant vendre  leurs  propres  enfants.  Les  droits  des  enfants  doivent  être  revendiqués 
puisqu'ils  ne  peuvent  le  faire  par  eux-mêmes.  C'est pourquoi  le  devoir  de  la  société 
est  d'agir  en  leur  faveur. 

Si la bourgeoisie  et  l'aristocratie  négligent  leurs  devoirs  envers  leurs  descendants, 
c'est  leur  affaire; jouissant  du privilège  de  ces  classes,  les  enfants  sont  condamnés  à 
en  subir  les  conséquences. 

Le  cas  des  classes  ouvrières  est  tout  à fait  différent.  Chaque ouvrier ne  peut  éviter 
les  abominations  qui  lui  sont  imposées  par  ses  pressants  besoins.  Il  est  trop  souvent 
même  trop  ignorant  pour  comprendre  le  véritable  intérêt  de  son  enfant  ou  les  con 
ditions  normales  du  développement  humain.  Cependant  la  partie  la  plus  éclairée 
des  classes  ouvrières  comprend  pleinement  que  l'avenir  de  leur  classe,  et par  consé 
quent  de  l'espèce  humaine,  dépend  de  la  formation  de  la  génération  ouvrière  qui 
grandit.  Ils  comprennent  que  surtout  les  enfants  et  les  jeunes  personnes  doivent 
être  préservés  des  effets  destructeurs  du  système  présent.  Ceci  peut  seulement  être 
accompli  par  la  transformation  de  la  raison  sociale  en force  sociale  et  dans  les  cir 
constances  présentes  nous  ne  pouvons  faire  ceci  que  par des  lois générales  mises  en 

638 

Rapport du  Conseil  Central 

vigueur par le  pouvoir de  l'Etat.  En  créant  de  telles  lois,  les  classes  ouvrières  ne  for 
tifieront  pas  le  pouvoir  gouvernemental,  de  même  qu'il  y  a  des  lois  pour  défendre 
les  privilèges  de  la  propriété,  pourquoi  n'en  existerait-il  pas  pour  en  empêcher  les 
abus ?  Au  contraire,  ces  lois  transformeraient  le  pouvoir  dirigé  contre  elles  en  leur 
propre  agent.  Le  prolétariat fera  alors  par une  mesure  générale  ce  qu'il essaierait en 
vain  d'accomplir  par  une  multitude  d'efforts  individuels. 

Partant  de  ces  points  établis,  nous  disons : 
La  société  ne  peut  permettre,  ni  aux  parents,  ni  aux  patrons,  d'employer pour  le 
travail les  enfants  et  les jeunes  personnes,  à moins  de  combiner  ce  travail  productif 
avec  l'éducation.  Par  éducation,  nous  entendons  trois  choses : 

Γ  Education  mentale; 
2°  Education  corporelle,  telle  qu'elle  est  produite  par  les  exercices  gymnasti-

ques  et  militaires. 

3° Education  technologique,  embrassant les  principes généraux  et scientifiques 

de tout mode  de  production et en même  temps  initiant les  enfants  et les jeunes  per 
sonnes  dans  le  maniement  des  instruments  élémentaires  de  toute  industrie. 

A  la  division  des  enfants  et  des jeunes  personnes  en  trois  classes  de  9  à  18  ans 
doit  correspondre  une  marche  graduée  et  progressive  pour  leur  éducation  mentale, 
gymnastique  et  technologique. 

En exceptant peut-être  la première  classe,  les  dépenses  de  ces  écoles  polytechni 

ques  doivent  être  en  partie  couvertes  par  la  vente  de  leurs  produits. 

Cette  combinaison  du  travail productif payé  avec  l'éducation  mentale,  les  exerci 
ces  corporels  et l'apprentissage  technologique,  élèvera les classes  ouvrières bien  au-
dessus  du  niveau  des  classes  bourgeoises  et  aristocratiques. 

Il est sous-entendu  que l'emploi de toute personne  de  9 à  18  ans  dans  tout travail 
de nuit ou  dans  toute  industrie  dont les  effets  sont nuisibles  à  la  santé  doit  être  sé 
vèrement  interdit  par  la  loi. 

5.  Travail  co-opératif. 

L'œuvre  de  l'Association  Internationale  est  de  combiner,  de  généraliser  et  de  don 
ner de  l'uniformité  aux  mouvements spontanés  des  classes  ouvrières,  mais  non  de  les 
diriger  ou  de  leur  imposer  n'importe  quel  système  doctrinaire.  Par  conséquent  le 
congrès  ne  doit  pas  proclamer un  système spécial  de  co-opération,  mais  doit  se  limi 
ter  à  renonciation  de  quelques  principes  généraux. 

(a) Nous  reconnaissons  le  mouvement  co-opératif  comme  une  des  forces  trans 
formatrices  de  la  société  présente,  basée  sur l'antagonisme  des  classes.  Leur grand 
mérite  est  de montrer pratiquement que  le  système  actuel de  subordination  du  travail 
au  capital,  despotique  et  paupérisateur,  peut  être  supplanté  par  le  système  républi 
cain  de  l'association  de  producteurs  libres  et  égaux. 

(b) Mais  le  mouvement  co-opératif limité  aux  formes  microscopiques  de  dévelop 
pement  que  peuvent  produire  par leurs  combinaisons  des  esclaves  individuels  sala 
riés,  est impuissant  à transformer par lui-même  la société  capitaliste.  Pour convertir 
la  production  sociale  en  un  large  et  harmonieux  système  de  travail  co-opératif,  des 

639 

Karl  Marx 

changements sociaux généraux  sont indispensables.  Les changements des conditions gé 
nérales de  la société  ne  seront jamais  réalisés  sans  l'emploi  des  forces  organisées  de 
la  société.  Donc  le  pouvoir  gouvernemental,  arraché  des  mains  des  capitalistes  et 
des  propriétaires  fonciers,  doit  être  manié  par  les  classes  ouvrières  elles-mêmes. 

, 

(c) Nous  recommandons  aux  ouvriers  d'encourager  la  co-opération  de production  J 

plutôt  que  la  co-opération  de  consommation.  Celle-ci  touchant  seulement  la  surface 
du  système  économique  actuel,  l'autre  l'attaquant  dans  sa  base. 

(d) Nous  recommandons  à toutes  les  sociétés  co-opératives  de  consacrer une  par 
tie  de  leurs  fonds  à  la propagande  de  leurs  principes,  de  prendre  l'initiative  de  nou 
velles  sociétés  co-opératives  de  production  et  de  faire  cette  propagande  aussi  bien 
par  la  parole  que  par  la  presse. 

(e) Dans  le but  d'empêcher les sociétés  co-opératives  de  dégénérer dans  les socie- 
tés  ordinaires bourgeoises  (sociétés  de  commandite)  tout ouvrier employé  doit recer 
voir  le  même  salaire,  associé  ou  non.  Comme  compromis purement temporaire,  nous 
consentons  à  admettre  un  bénéfice  très  minime  aux  sociétaires.

6.  Sociétés  ouvrières  (trades'  u n i o n s)  leur  passé, 
leur  présent,  leur  avenir. 

•Î 

' 

(a)  Leur  passé. 
Le  capital est  la force  sociale  concentrée ;  tandis  que  l'ouvrier ne  dispose  que  de 
sa force productive individuelle.  Donc le contrat entre le capital  et le travail ne peut  20 
jamais  être  établi  sur  des  bases  équitables,  même  en  donnant  au  mot  équitable  le  <• 
sens  que  lui  attribue  une  société  plaçant  les  conditions  matérielles  du  travail  d'un 
côté  et  l'énergie  vitale  productive  de  l'autre.  Le  seul  pouvoir  social  que  possèdent 
les  ouvriers,  c'est leur nombre.  La force  du  nombre  est  annulée  par la  désunion.  La 
désunion  des  ouvriers  est  engendrée  et  perpétuée  par  la  concurrence  inévitable faite  25; 
entre  eux-mêmes.  Les  trades'  unions  (associations  de  métiers)  originairement  sont 
nées  des  essais  spontanés  des  ouvriers  luttant  contre  les  ordres  despotiques  du  capi 
tal,  pour  empêcher  ou  au  moins  atténuer  les  effets  de  cette  concurrence faite par les 
ouvriers  entre  eux.  Ils  voulaient  changer  les  termes  du  contrat,  de  telle  sorte  qu'ils 
pussent  au  moins  s'élever  au-dessus  de  la  condition  de  simples  esclaves.  L'objet  30 
immédiat  des  trades'  unions  est  toutefois  limité  aux  nécessités  des  luttes  journaliè 
res  du  travail et  du  capital,  à  des  expédients  contre  l'usurpation  incessante  du  capi 
tal,  en  un  mot,  aux  questions  de  salaire  et  d'heures  de  travail.  On  ne  peut  y  renon 
cer  tant  que  le  système  actuel  dure;  au  contraire,  les  trades'  unions  doivent 
généraliser  leur  action  en  se  combinant. 

35j 

D'un  autre  côté,  les  trades' unions  ont formé  à  leur insu  des  centres  organisateurs 
de  la  classe  ouvrière,  de  même  que  les  communes  et  les  municipalités  du  moyen-
âge  en  avaient  constitués  pour  la  classe  bourgeoise.  Si  les  trades'  unions,  dans  leur 
première  capacité,  sont  indispensables  dans  la  guerre  d'escarmouches  du  travail  el 
du  capital,  elles  sont  encore  plus  importantes  dans  leur  dernière  capacité,  comme  40 
organes  de  transformation  du  système  du  travail  salarié  et  de  la  dictature  capitali 
ste. 

640 

Rapport du  Conseil  Central 

(b) Leur  présent. 
Les  trades'  unions  s'occupent  trop  exclusivement  des  luttes  immédiates.  Elles 

¡J- 
κ 
n'ont  pas  assez  compris  leur  pouvoir  d'action  contre  le  système  capitaliste  lui-
li  même.  Néanmoins,  dans  ces  derniers  temps  elles  ont  commencé  à  s'apercevoir  de 
leur  grande  mission  historique.  Par  exemple,  la  résolution  suivante,  récemment 
j?5 
adoptée  par la  grande  conférence  des  différents  délégués  des  trades'  unions  tenue  à 
£. 
Ü  Sheffield  :  «Cette  conférence,  appréciant  à  leur  juste  valeur  les  efforts  faits  par  F  As 
sociation  internationale  des  travailleurs  pour unir dans  un lien fraternel les  ouvriers 
si; 
de  tous  les  pays,  recommande  très  sérieusement  à  toutes  les  sociétés  représentées 
p 
de  s'affilier à  cette Association,  dans  la  conviction  que  l'Association  internationale 
forme  un  élément  nécessaire  pour  le  progrès  et  la  prospérité  de  toute  la  commu 
nauté  ouvrière.» 

j* 

(c) Leur  avenir. 
A  part  leur  œuvre  immédiate  de  réaction  contre  les  manœuvres  tracassières  du 
:  capital,  elles  doivent maintenant  agir sciemment  comme  foyers  organisateurs  de  la 
classe  ouvrière  dans  le  grand  but  de  son  émancipation  radicale.  Elles  doivent  aider 
tout mouvement  social  et  politique  tendant  dans  cette  direction.  En  se  considérant 
et agissant  comme  les  champions  et les  représentants  de toute  la classe  ouvrière,  el-
;  les  réussiront  à  englober  dans  leur  sein  les  «non-society  men»  (hommes  ne  faisant 
1:120  point partie  des  sociétés) ;  en s'occupant  des  industries les plus misérablement rétri-
buées,  comme  l'industrie  agricole,  où  des  circonstances  exceptionnellement  défa-
vorables  ont  empêché  toute  résistance  organisée,  elles  feront  naître  la  conviction 
dans  les  grandes  masses  ouvrières  qu'au  lieu  d'être  circonscrites  dans  des  limites 
étroites  et  égoïstes,  leur but tend  à l'émancipation  des  millions  de  prolétaires  foulés

(a) Aucune  modification  de  la  forme  de  perception  des  impôts  ne  saurait  pro 

duire  un  changement  important  dans  les  relations  du  capital  et  du  travail. 

(b) Néanmoins,  ayant  à  choisir  entre  deux  systèmes  d'impôts  nous  recomman-
I  |0  dons l'abolition  totale  des  impôts  indirects  et leur substitution  complète par les  im 
pôts  directs ;  parce  que  la  perception  des  impôts  directs  est  à  meilleur  marché  et 
f '  n'intervient pas  dans  la production ;  parce  que  les  impôts  indirects  haussent  le  prix 
jfV  des  marchandises,  les  commerçants  les  chargeant  non-seulement  du  montant  de 
f~ 
ces impôts,  mais encore de l'intérêt et du profit du capital avancé dans  le paiement ; 
p35  parce  que la méthode  des  impôts indirects mystifie le  contribuable sur ce  qu'il paye 
à l'Etat,  tandis  que  les  taxes  directes  n'admettent pas  de  déguisements.  C'est pour 
quoi  les  impôts  directs  tiennent  éveillé  le  contrôle  du  gouvernement  par  chaque 
membre  de  l'Etat,  tandis  que  les  impôts  indirects  tuent  la  tendance  au  self-govern 
ment  (gouvernement par  soi-même).

de  disposer  d ' e u x - m ê m es  et  de  reconstruire  u ne  Pologne 
sur  des  bases  d é m o c r a t i q u es  et  sociales. 

(a)  Pourquoi  les  ouvriers  d'Europe  prennent  à  cœur  cette  question?  En  premier 
lieu  parce  qu'il y  a  conspiration  du  silence  de  la  part  des  écrivains  et  des  agitateurs 
bourgeois ;  quoiqu'ils  patronisent  toutes  sortes  de  nationalités,  même  l'Irlande  sur 
le  continent. 

D'où  vient  ce  silence?  Parce  que  ensemble,  bourgeois  et  aristocrates  comptent 
sur  ce  sinistre  pouvoir  asiatique  placé  dans  l'arrière  scène,  qui  doit  faire  son  appari 
tion  lorsque  la  marée  montante  de  la  classe  ouvrière  débordera.  Ce  pouvoir ne  peut 
être  renversé  réellement  que  par  la  reconstruction  d'une  Pologne  sur  des  bases  dé 
mocratiques. 

(b) Avec  les  changements  récents  de  l'Europe  centrale,  et  spécialement  de  l'Alle 
magne,  une  Pologne  démocratique  et  indépendante  est  plus  que jamais  nécessaire, 
car  de  son  existence  dépendra  le  sort  de  l'Allemagne,  devenant  l'avant-garde  de  la 
Sainte-Alliance  ou  la  co-opératrice  de  la  France  républicaine.  Le  mouvement  ou 
vrier sera continuellement interrompu,  entravé  et retardé jusqu'à ce  que  cette grande 
question  soit  résolue. 

(c) Il est spécialement du  devoir des  classes ouvrières  allemandes  de prendre l'ini 
tiative  de  cette  question,  l'Allemagne  ayant  été  participatrice  du  démembrement 
de  la  Pologne. 

10.  A r m é es  p e r m a n e n t es ;  leurs  rapports  avec  la  production. 

(a) L'influence  délétère  des  grandes  armées  permanentes  sur  la  production  a  été 
suffisamment  dénoncée  par  les  congrès  bourgeois  de  toute  couleur  et  de  toute  dé 
nomination  (congrès  de  paix,  congrès  des  économistes,  congrès  de  statistique,  con 
grès  philanthropique,  congrès  sociologique).  Nous  pensons  pour cela  qu'il  est tout à 
fait  superflu  de  s'étendre  sur  ce  point. 

(b) Nous  proposons  l'armement  universel  du  peuple  et  son  instruction  complète 

dans  le  maniement  des  armes. 

(c) Comme  nécessité  transitoire,  nous  acceptons  de  petites  armées  permanentes, 
pour  servir  d'école  aux  officiers  de  la  milice,  chaque  citoyen  étant  obligé  de  passer 
un  temps  très  court  dans  cette  armée.

Société  Internationale  des  Travailleurs. 
Compte  rendu  des  débats. 

Séance  du  3  Septembre. 
Président :  le  citoyen  Dupleix. 

La  section  de  Genève,  ayant  été  chargée  par  le  conseil  central  de  faire  les  prépara 
tifs  nécessaires  pour  la  tenue  du  congrès,  procède  à  la  vérification  des  pouvoirs. 

La  présentation  des  mandats  a  donné  le  résultat  suivant :  Délégués  des  sections, 

45 ;  Délégués  des  sociétés  adhérentes,  15 ;  total,  60. 

Une  discussion  très-vive  a  été  provoquée  par  la  demande  de  quelques  personnes 
qui,  sans  pouvoir  présenter  de  mandats,  se  croyaient  en  droit  d'être  admises, 
comme  délégués  des sections  de Paris,  à prendre part aux travaux du  congrès.  Ils  al 
léguaient  la  situation  administrative  de  la  France,  où  les  réunions  ne  sont  point 
permises.  Quelques  membres  appuyaient  leur  demande,  d'après  eux  l'organisation 
du  congrès  n'étant  ni  complète  ni  définitive,  il  ne  convenait  pas  d'être  trop  exi 
geant,  et  qu'au  contraire  il  serait  plus  utile  d'admettre  aux  travaux  du  congrès  tout 
homme  de  bonne  volonté.  Les  délégués  anglais  affirmaient,  au  contraire,  qu'étant 
les représentants  de  sections  et  de  sociétés  comptant  plusieurs milliers  de  membres, 
ils  étaient  venus  au  congrès  avec  la  conviction  que  le  système  représentatif en  for 
merait  la  base  et  qu'en  cas  d'admission  de  personnes  ne  représentant  aucun  corps 
constitué,  ils  seraient  dans  les  discussions  et  les  votes  sur  le  pied  d'une  inégalité 
contraire  à la justice  et  que  leurs  droits  comme  représentants  en  seraient lésés.  L'as 
semblée,  en  passant  outre,  décide  que  le  droit  de  prendre  part  dans  les  discussions 
et  au  vote  appartient  exclusivement  aux  délégués  ayant  leurs  mandats  en  règle. 

Les  délégués,  après  cette  interruption,  se  sont occupés  de  l'élection  de  leur prési 
dent,  et le  citoyen  Jung,  délégué  du  conseil  central,  a  été  choisi  pour diriger les  dé 
bats  du  congrès  à  une  majorité  de  45  voix. 

Le citoyen  Dupleix,  de  la  section française  de  Genève  et  le  citoyen  Becker,  de  la 

section  allemande  de  la  même  ville,  ont  été  nommés  vice-présidents. 

Les  citoyens  Coullery  (de  La  Chaux-de-Fonds),  Card  (de  Genève),  Bourdon  (de 

Paris),  Moll  (d'Allemagne)  ont  été  nommés  secrétaires. 

On  a  décidé  qu'il y  aurait  deux  séances  par jour,  la  première  à  9  heures  du  matin 

et  la  deuxième  à  deux  heures  de  l'après-midi. 

Le  citoyen  Cremer  (Londres)  demande  à  ce  que  tout  membre  qui  fait une  propo 
sition n'ait que  15  minutes  pour l'introduire  et  l'appuyer;  et  qu'il ne reprenne  la pa 
role  qu'une  seule  fois  pour  répondre  aux  objections  faites,  et  qu'alors  il  n'ait  plus 
que  dix  minutes  et  que  les  membres  qui  parleront  sur  la  question  ne  gardent  la  pa 
role  que  pendant  dix  minutes. 

La  proposition  est  votée  à  l'unanimité.

Neuf  heures  du  matin. 
Président :  le  citoyen  Jung. 

Le  citoyen  Fribourg  donne  lecture,  au  nom  de  la  section  de  Paris,  du  rapport  éta 
blissant  l'état  des  recettes  et  dépenses  de  la  société  dans  cette  ville.  Ce  rapport  fait 
connaître  aussi  le  résultat  moral  obtenu  en  France. 

Le  citoyen  Cremer  donne  également  lecture  du  rapport  administratif  du  conseil 
central  de  Londres.  De  ce  rapport  il  résulte  que  déjà  25173  citoyens  de  diverses 
professions  font  partie  de  l'Association.  Le  rapport  fait  espérer  que  plus  de  20 000 
nouveaux  membres  s'y  adjoindront  prochainement.  Le  résultat  moral  obtenu  par 
l'Association  internationale  a  été  très  grand  en  Angleterre. 

Le  citoyen  Coullery  remercie,  au  nom de  l'assemblée,  les  ouvriers  anglais  de tout 

ce  qui  a  été  fait  par  eux. 

Le  citoyen  Fribourg,  au  nom  de  tous  les  délégués  français,  remercie  le  conseil 
central  et  demande  que  la  dette  de  Londres  soit  considérée  comme  internationale. 
Sur  la  proposition  d'une  grande  partie  des  membres  de  l'assemblée,  le  citoyen 
Dupont  donne  lecture  de  la  traduction  du  mémoire  rédigé  par  le  conseil  central  de 
Londres,  qui  embrasse  presque  toutes  les  questions  mises  à  l'étude  par  le  pro 
gramme  de  l'Association  internationale. 

Le  citoyen  Chemalé  donne  ensuite  lecture,  toujours  au  nom  de  la  section  de  Pa 

ris,  du  mémoire  comportant  l'étude  de  toutes  les  questions  du  programme. 

Cette  lecture  est  interrompue  par  l'heure  de  la  clôture.

Le  citoyen  Tolain propose  que  tous  les  rapports  soient  lus  et  relus ;  et  qu'ensuite 

la  discussion  générale  sur  les  rapports  s'ouvre. 

La  proposition  est  adoptée  à  une  grande  majorité. 
Le  citoyen  Eccarius  fait  la  lecture  en  allemand  du  rapport  du  comité  central  de

Londres. 

Sur  la  question  de  l'instruction  existe  un  rapport rédigé  par  la  minorité  et un  par 

la  majorité  de  la  section  parisienne. 

La  délégation  de  Lyon,  après  la  lecture  du  rapport  parisien,  dit  qu'elle  renonce  à 
faire  la  lecture  du  sien  et  adhère  complètement  à  ce  dernier,  celui-ci  contenant  ses 
idées,  ses  principes.  Cependant  sur  la  question  de  l'instruction,  elle  se  prononce 
pour  l'éducation  donnée  par  la  famille.

Le  citoyen  Card  (Suisse)  propose  la  discussion  du  programme,  article par  article.  Il 
20  demande  qu'on  rédige  pour  chaque  question  une  formule  qui  servira  de  point  de 

départ  pour  la  discussion  publique. 

La  proposition  du  citoyen  Card  est  appuyée  par  tous  les  membres  présents. 
La  deuxième  question  allait  être  mise  à  l'étude,  conformément  à  cette  proposi 
tion,  lorsque  le  citoyen  Cremer  (Londres)  fit  remarquer  qu'on  ne  pouvait  discuter 
25  avec fruit  sans  la  présence  de  tous  les  délégués,  car  il  pourrait  arriver  que  les  mem 
bres  de  la  commission  rejetassent  une  ou  plusieurs  résolutions  prises  par  l'assem 
blée.  Le  citoyen  fait  aussi  remarquer  que  tous  les  programmes  ne  sont  pas  sembla-
bles.  L'ordre  des  questions  est  interverti,  quelques  articles  même  du  programme 
français  n'existent  pas  sur  le  programme  anglais  et  genevois.

Le  citoyen  Card  (Suisse)  lit une  lettre  adressée  de Milan  par le  citoyen  Stampa  aux 
membres  du  congrès.  Dans  cette  lettre,  les  citoyens  italiens  expriment  le  regret  de

Ils  espèrent  que  leur  adhésion  sera  considérée  comme  un  acte  de  présence.  Cette 
lettre  produit  une  grande  impression  sur  l'assemblée,  elle  est  accueillie  par  d'una-

nimes  applaudissements.  Plusieurs  membres  demandent  que  cette  lettre  soit  tra 
duite  en  allemand  et  en  anglais  et  insérée  dans  le  procès-verbal  du  congrès.  Cette 
proposition  est  acceptée  par  tous  les  délégués. 

Le  président  fait  connaître  que  les  journaux  anglais,  le  Times  et  le  Daily  News, 
viennent  de  publier chacun  un  article  sur le  congrès  et  sur  l'Association  internatio 
nale,  qu'ils  avaient  dédaignés jusqu'aujourd'hui.  Il  ajoute  que  ce  fait  a  une  grande 
importance  pour  l'Angleterre,  ces  deux  journaux  étant  les  plus  considérables  de 
Londres. 

Le  citoyen  Coullery  (Suisse)  est  ensuite  appelé  à  donner  lecture,  au  nom  de  la 
commission  nommée  pour  l'élaboration  des  statuts,  du  rapport  de  cette  commis 
sion. 

Plusieurs  membres  demandent  qu'on fasse  en  entier la lecture  des  statuts,  qui  se 

ront  ensuite  discutés  un  à  un. 

La  proposition  acceptée,  le  rapporteur  commence  la  lecture. 
Sur  l'article  1,  ayant  trait  à  la  nomination  du  secrétaire  général,  les  délégués  se 
trouvent  très  divisés.  La  délégation  anglaise  propose  qu'il  soit  nommé  par  le 
congrès  afin  de  rendre  sa  responsabilité  plus  grande. 

Les  citoyens Tolain  (Paris)  et  autres, veulent,  au  contraire,  que  le  secrétaire géné 
ral  soit  nommé  par  le  conseil  central.  Ces  citoyens  veulent  éviter  toute  scission  qui 
pourrait naître  de  ces  deux pouvoirs  issus  du  même  vote,  le  conseil  central  et le  se 
crétaire  général.  Les  conflits  qui  pourraient  en  résulter  dureraient  peut-être 
jusqu'au  prochain  congrès  et  entraveraient  la  marche  de  l'Association. 

Cette  dernière  opinion  obtient  la  majorité  de  l'assemblée. 
Sur  l'article  2,  concernant  la  fixation  du  congrès,  le  citoyen  Card  dit  qu'il  croit 
que  le  choix  du  jour  et  du  lieu  du  congrès  doit  être  laissé  à  l'initiative  du  conseil 
central. 

Cette proposition est appuyée  par les  délégués allemands  et anglais.  Elle  est  com 

battue  par  beaucoup  d'autres  membres  des  délégations  française  et  suisse. 

Le  citoyen  Murât,  fait  la  proposition  suivante :  que  l'époque  du  congrès  soit irré 
vocablement  fixée  chaque  année  par  le  congrès  lui-même  et  que  la  faculté  de  choi 
sir  le  lieu,  suivant  les  circonstances,  où  devra  se  tenir  l'assemblée,  soit  laissée  à 
l'initiative  du  conseil  central. 

Les  membres  qui  appuient  cette  proposition  désirent  que  les  délégations  des  di 
vers  pays  puissent,  quelle  qu'en  soit  la  décision  du  conseil  central,  se  réunir  à  une 
époque  fixe,  sans  convocation  aucune. 

La  proposition  du  citoyen  Murât  est  acceptée  par  la  majorité. 
Le  citoyen  Tolain  prend  la  parole  sur  une  question  d'ordre,  il  propose  qu'on  em 
ploie  pour  les  amendements  faits  aux  différentes  propositions  la  méthode  employée 
au  Corps  législatif français  et  dans  d'autres  parlements  étrangers,  qui  consiste  à  dé 
poser  sur  le  bureau  les  amendements  écrits.  Le  président  les  met  en  discussion  en 
commençant  par  celui  qui  s'éloigne  le  plus  de  la  proposition. 

La  proposition  du  citoyen  Tolain,  combattue  par  les  délégués  anglais,  est  ap 

puyée  et  adoptée  par  la  majorité. 

La  discussion  des  articles  des  statuts  continue. 
A  propos  du  congrès  annuel,  les  citoyens  Cremer  et  Odger  disent  qu'ils  ne

Séances du  5 septembre  1866 

croient  pas  utile  de  tenir  un  congrès  tous  les  ans ;  leur  principale  raison  en  faveur

i 

La  majorité  des  membres  croit  que  chaque  congrès  amènera  une  recrudescence 
de vie  dans  l'Association  et  attirera un plus  grand  nombre  de  membres,  ce  qui  per-

Sur  l'article  7,  qui  a rapport  aux  avances  à  faire  aux  membres  qui voyagent  d'un 
pays  à  l'autre,  les  délégués  émettent  des  avis  partagés.  Les  uns  veulent  que  l'on  ne 
10  donne  pas  aux  sections  le  pouvoir  d'accorder  à  tous  les  membres  un  crédit  dont 
elles  pourraient  devenir victimes.  Ils  disent  que  l'ouvrier  doit  s'habituer  à  l'écono 
mie  et  ne  compter  sur  aucun  secours  d'argent.  Ils  ajoutent  que  l'Association  inter 
nationale  doit  seulement  s'occuper  de  trouver  de  l'ouvrage  à  l'ouvrier  qui  se  pré 
sente  et  lui  accorder  ce  que  dans  certains  pays  on  nomme  un  viatique.

Les  citoyens  Tolain  et  Fribourg,  répondent  qu'il  est  très  facile  de  parer  à  ces  in 
convénients  et  proposent  le  moyen  suivant :  chaque  section à  laquelle  appartiendra 
le  membre  qui  se  déplace  se  portera nécessairement garant de  sa  solvabilité  envers 
la  section  ou  les  sections  correspondantes  qui  feront  des  avances  au membre voya 
geur.  Et  dans  le  cas,  très  rare,  où  le  bureau  correspondant  n'aurait  pas  d'argent  en 
20  caisse,  il n'aurait  qu'à  tirer  immédiatement  à  vue  sur le  bureau  expéditeur  afin  de 
se  faire  rembourser  de  suite  l'avance  faite.  De  cette  façon,  il  n'y  aura  ni  charité  ni 
production.  C'est un  droit  qui  appartiendra  à tout  citoyen.  La  section  est seule juge 
de  la  manière  dont  elle  doit  créditer  le  membre  demandeur. 

La  délégation  anglaise  demande  l'ajournement  de  cette  question.  Il n'est  pas  ac-

ï 
25  cepté.  Et  la proposition  est  votée  à  la  majorité.  -  Deux  opposants. 

Sur l'article  8,  qui a trait aux conditions  exigées pour faire partie  de l'Association 

internationale,  une  discussion  très  animée  a  lieu. 

Une  partie  de  l'assemblée  demande  que  tout  citoyen  qui,  quoique  ne  travaillant 
pas  manuellement,  concourt  à  l'émancipation  de  la  classe  ouvrière,  soit  admis  à 
faire  partie  de  l'Association  internationale  des  travailleurs. 

•30 

Les  délégués  de  Paris  et  plusieurs  de  la  Suisse  demandent,  au  contraire,  que  la 
qualité  de  travailleur manuel soit  exigée.  Leur raison  est  que  bien  des  ambitieux  et 
des  intrigants  s'introduiraient dans  l'Association  afin  de  s'en  rendre  maître  dans  un 
temps  plus  ou  moins  long  et  de  la faire  servir  à  leur  intérêt personnel,  et par  conse 

ns  quent  ils  la  détourneraient  de  son  but. 

Après  une  longue  discussion,  l'assemblée  se  prononce  pour  la  proposition  sui 

vante,  présentée  par  les  membres  de  la  commission : 

Sera  admis  membre  de  l'Association  internationale  des  travailleurs  tout  homme 
pouvant justifier  de  sa  qualité  de  travailleur;  de  cette  façon  chaque  section  restera 

¿40  maîtresse  d'admettre  sous  sa  responsabilité  qui  bon  lui  semblera. 

Les  articles  9,  10,  11,  sont  admis  à l'unanimité.

Organisation  de  l'Association. 

Les  citoyens  Dupont  (Londres)  et  Carter  (Londres)  proposent  de  nommer une  com 
mission  de  5  membres  pour  rédiger les  règlements  spéciaux  de  l'Association.  Cette 
proposition  est  acceptée.  Sont  nommés : 

Les  citoyens  Eccarius,  Fribourg,  Burkli,  Coullery  et  Schettel. 
Le  citoyen  Tolain  (Paris)  demande  si  les  travaux,  les  mémoires  présentés  au 

congrès  seront  publiés  aux  frais  du  conseil  général. 

Le  citoyen  Card  (Polonais)  demande  qu'on  nomme  une  commission  pour juger 
des  choses  nécessaires  à  publier,  en  laissant  aux  sections  la  liberté  de  publier  leurs 
travaux  dans  le  cas  de  non  insertion  au  procès-verbal  du  congrès. 

Le  citoyen  Becker  (Allemagne)  s'oppose  à  la  nomination  de  cette  commission  et 
soutient  que  ce  travail,  qui  nécessite  dix  à  quinze jours,  doit  être  confié  aux  soins 
du  conseil  général  de  Londres. 

La  proposition  du  citoyen  Becker  est  votée  à  l'unanimité. 
Le  citoyen  Tolain  (Paris)  propose  que  les  trois  rapports  des  délégations  anglaise, 
allemande  et  françaises™  soient  publiés  in  extenso  dans  les  comptes  rendus  du 
congrès. 

Voté  à  l'unanimité. 
Le  citoyen  Dupont  demande  que  toutes  les  publications  faites  par  les  différentes 
sections  soient  envoyées  au  conseil  général  pour  être  conservées  dans  les  archives 
de  l'Association  internationale. 

La  proposition  du  citoyen  Dupont  est  adoptée. 
Le  citoyen  Tolain propose  que  la lettre  du  citoyen  Stampa  soit publiée  in  extenso 

dans  les  comptes  rendus. 

Le  bureau  propose  d'écrire  une  lettre  en  réponse  à  celle  des  ouvriers  italiens. 
Cette  proposition  est  approuvée.

Séance  du  6  Septembre  1866. 
Deux  heures  du  soir. 
Président:  le  citoyen  Jung. 

Le  citoyen  Dupont  (Londres)  appelle  l'attention  de  l'assemblée  sur  un  fait  qui  s'est 
passé  à  Ferney  et qu'il est  important  de  faire  connaître  à tous  les  délégués.  La musi 
que  de  Ferney,  composée  de  travailleurs,  avait  manifesté  l'intention  de  participer 
au  congrès  en  offrant  son  concours  gratuit  pour  la  fête  de  dimanche.  Un  arrêté  pré 
fectoral  les  en  a  empêchés.  L'autorité  a  retiré  en  même  temps  au  chef de  musique 
l'allocation  qui  lui  était  accordée. 

Le  citoyen  Dupleix  (Genève)  confirme  les  faits  avancés  par le  citoyen Dupont. 
Le  citoyen  Fribourg  (Paris)  émet  la  proposition  suivante : 
«Le  congrès  manifeste  hautement  son  étonnement  à  propos  de  l'acte  administra 
tif dont  le  chef de  la  musique  de  Ferney  a  été  victime,  et  charge  son  président  de 
lui  exprimer  ses  regrets  et  l'assurance  de  ses  sympathies. » 

La  proposition  est  votée. 
Le  citoyen  Dupont  (Londres)  fait  remarquer  qu'un  groupe  de  Français  étant 
venu  à  Genève  sans  délégation  pour  participer  aux  travaux  du  congrès,  il  serait 
utile  que  la  réunion  votât  immédiatement  l'admission  d'un  membre  de  ce  groupe 
pour faire  connaître  le  sujet  qu'ils  désirent  traiter  en  séance  publique;  et  il  ajoute 
que  ce  groupe  accuse  la  délégation  parisienne  de  vouloir  mettre  la  lumière  sous  le 
boisseau. 

Le  citoyen  Fribourg  (Paris)  donne,  au  nom  des  Français,  un  démenti  formel  à 
cette  accusation  et  dit  que  la  délégation parisienne  a toujours  demandé et  demande 
encore  l'admission  du  groupe  dissident. 

Plusieurs  membres  allemands  et  anglais  disent  qu'ils  ne  comprennent  pas  pour 

quoi  cette  question  est  encore  soulevée,  et  demandent  l'ordre  du jour. 

Un  tumulte  s'étant  élevé  dans  la  salle,  le  citoyen  Dupleix  dit  que  le  congrès  étant 
placé  sous les  auspices  du  comité genevois,  il engage  les membres  de  cette  section  à 
rétablir  l'ordre. 

L'ordre  du jour  étant  proposé,  il  est  accepté  par  la  majorité.  17  opposants.

C o m b i n a i s on  des  efforts  au  m o y en 
de  l'association  p o ur  les  différentes  luttes  sociales 
e n t re  le  capital  et  le  travail. 

Le  citoyen  Dupont  (Londres)  donne  lecture  du  passage  du  rapport  du  conseil  cen 
tral  ayant  trait  à  cette  question  et  ajoute  ces  paroles : 

J'appelle  l'attention  du  congrès  sur  la  statistique  proposée  par  le  conseil  central. 
C'est  une  des  premières  et  des  plus  importantes  questions  que  nous  ayons  à  résou 
dre,  car  c'est  elle  seule  qui  nous  fournira  des  données  positives  sur  la  position  res-

661 

Association  Internationale  des Travailleurs.  Compte  rendu  du  Congrès  de  Genève  (1866) 

pective  des  classes  ouvrières  de  tous  les  pays ;  alors  seulement  nous  pourrons  agir 
en  connaissance  de  cause,  car  nous  connaîtrons  les  éléments  de  la  lutte  sociale. 

Le  citoyen  Lawrence  prend  la  parole  sur  cette  question  et  explique  quelles  com 
binaisons  doivent  être  employées  pour  activer  cette  lutte  et  pour  lui  donner  un  ca 
ractère  de  jour  en  jour  plus  accentué.  Il  veut  que  des  liens  s'établissent  entre  les 
classes  ouvrières  des  différents  pays,  afin  qu'elles  connaissent  leurs  situations  res 
pectives.  Par  ce  moyen  on  parviendra  à  déjouer  les  projets  des  patrons.  A  l'appui  de 
son  raisonnement,  il  cite  la  dernière  grève  des  tailleurs  de  Londres.  Les  patrons, 
pour  éluder  les  justes  demandes  de  leurs  ouvriers,  firent  venir  des  ouvriers  alle 
mands,  qui,  une  fois  arrivés,  se  trouvèrent  sans  travail  et  au  milieu  d'une  popula 
tion  dont  ils  ne  comprenaient  point  la  langue ;  aussi  furent-ils  exploités  d'une  ma 
nière  indigne  par  les  patrons,  qui  les  faisaient  travailler  au-dessous  du  prix  payé 
aux  Anglais.  La  société  des  tailleurs  de  Londres  et  le  conseil  général  ont  fait  leur 
possible  pour  ces  pauvres  ouvriers,  les  ont  aidés  à retourner  dans  leur pays  ou  à re 
cevoir  leur  salaire  légitime.  Un  fait  analogue  vient  de  se  passer  avec  les  terrassiers 
des  chemins  de  fer  de  Londres.  Puisque  les  capitalistes,  grâce  aux  moyens  fournis 
par  l'industrie,  ont  tant  de  puissance  pour  pressurer  l'ouvrier,  celui-ci  n'a  qu'un 
moyen  de  secouer  le joug,  c'est  l'entente  entre  tous  les  travailleurs  de  tous  les  pays 
pour  déclarer  une  lutte  à  mort  à  la  race  des  capitalistes.  Pour  établir  cette  lutte,  il 
faut  que  chaque  section  de  l'Association  internationale  devienne  un  bureau  de  ren 
seignements  où  chaque  ouvrier puisse  trouver  des  données  positives  sur  l'état  de  la 
classe  ouvrière  du pays  où  il veut  aller.  Dans ce but,  le  citoyen Lawrence fait  la pro 
position  suivante : 

Que  les  différentes  sections  de  cette  Association  entrent  en  communication  avec 
les  sociétés  ouvrières  ou  les  travailleurs  individuels,  là  où  il  n'existe  pas  de  société, 
qu'elles  fassent  un  rapport  sur  l'état  économique  et  politique  de  la  classe  ouvrière 
du  pays  et  le  communiquent  aux  autres  sections. 

Le  citoyen  Murât  (Paris)  appuie  la  proposition  du  citoyen  Lawrence. 
Le  citoyen  Coullery  (Suisse)  s'appesantit  sur  ceci,  que  les  capitaux  amassés  par 
les  ouvriers  ne  doivent  pas  retomber  aux  mains  des  capitalistes,  mais  doivent  servir 
à  former  des  associations  de  co-opération,  qui  enrichiront  la  classe  ouvrière  et  aug 
menteront  sa  puissance  dans  la  lutte  contre  la  classe  des  exploiteurs,  et  il  termine 
par  ces  mots :  l'exploitation  capitaliste  est  le  vol  reconnu  par  la  loi. 

Le  citoyen  Dupont  (Londres)  dit  que  l'on  doit  considérer  la  proposition  de  Law 
rence  comme  non  avenue,  car  le  conseil  général  a  prévu  le  cas  en  proposant  une 
statistique  devant  fournir  toute  espèce  de  détails  sur  la  position  de  la  classe 
ouvrière.  Cette  statistique  est  impérieusement  réclamée,  ajoute-t-il,  car  la  position 
de  l'ouvrier  en  présence  du  patron  est  des  plus  précaires.  Jugez-en  par  ce  fait:  un 
ouvrier  avait  été  à  Sheffield  embauché  pour  deux  ans  par  un  patron.  Une  grève  ar 
rive,  les  ouvriers  obtiennent  une  augmentation  de  salaire ;  l'ouvrier  embauché  veut 
jouir  de  la  même  augmentation ;  le  patron  refuse,  alors  l'ouvrier  cesse  de  travailler. 
Le  patron  a  recours  alors  aux  tribunaux,  qui  condamnent  l'ouvrier  à trois  mois  de 
prison.  A sa  sortie  le  patron réclame  l'ouvrier,  mais  celui-ci  de  nouveau refuse  éner-
giquement  tout  travail ;  le  magistrat  le  menace  d'un  emprisonnement  de  trois  mois 
à  trois  ans,  si  immédiatement  il  ne  rentre  dans  l'atelier  au  prix  convenu  antérieure-

662 

Séances  du  6  septembre  1866 

ment à la grève.  Vous  le  voyez,  tout  est  tourné  contre  l'ouvrier,  qui,  en présence  du 
capitaliste,  est  livré  sans  défense.  Il  faut  au  moins  que  par  cette  statistique  nous  lui 
fassions  connaître  le  terrain  sur  lequel  il  marche. 

Le  citoyen  Tolain  (Paris)  dit  qu'en  Angleterre,  grâce  à  la  liberté,  le  mouvement 
social  s'est  manifesté  par  la  résistance,  par  la  grève ;  tandis  qu'en  France,  à  cause 
des  entraves  apportées  à  l'organisation  de  la  classe  ouvrière,  la  grève  n'a  été  qu'un 
moyen  extrême ;  et  l'association  a  été  considérée  comme  le  seul  moyen  d'émanci 
pation. 

Le  citoyen  Odger  (Londres).  Dans  nos  grèves  d'Angleterre,  les  patrons  obligent 
leurs  ouvriers  à  céder par l'importation  d'ouvriers  continentaux,  ou par la  seule  me 
nace  de  leur  importation.  11  faut  que,  grâce  à  l'Association  internationale,  des  faits 
pareils  ne  puissent  plus  se  renouveler.  Et,  comme  la  cause  première  d'où  dérivent 
ces  importations  gît  dans  l'infériorité  des  salaires  des  ouvriers  sur  le  continent,  les 
ouvriers  anglais  appuieront  de  leur  côté  toute  réclamation  des  ouvriers  continen 
taux  et  feront  au  besoin  des  sacrifices  pécuniaires  pour  les  soutenir  dans  leur  lutte. 
Le  citoyen  Eccarius  (Londres).  Les  grèves  ne  doivent  plus  se  borner  à  une  seule 
nation,  la  centralisation  capitaliste  est  devenue  si  puissante  que  les  patrons  les  dé 
jouent  soit  par  l'autorisation  des  ouvriers  étrangers,  soit  en  commandant  le  travail 
dans  d'autres  pays,  c'est  ce  qui  est  arrivé  dernièrement  pour  la  grève  de  Sheffield ; 
les  patrons  ont fait  commander  en Amérique  pour paralyser  le  mouvement  de  leurs 
ouvriers,  mais  les  travailleurs  américains  ont  refusé  de  se  prêter  à  leurs  machina 
tions.  Des  faits  semblables  n'arrivent  pas  tous  les  jours,  ordinairement  le  patron 
triomphe  par  ce  moyen.  Donc,  aujourd'hui,  pour  rendre  la  grève  profitable,  il  faut 
qu'au  même  moment  les  ouvriers  de  tous  les  pays  refusent  de  travailler;  qué  la 
grève  soit  universelle.  Demander  la  grève  universelle,  c'est  réclamer  la  révolution. 

Le  citoyen  Cremer  (Londres)  reconnaît  la  nécessité  de  cette  statistique,  et,  pour 
en  faire  comprendre  toute  l'importance,  il  cite  ce  qui  s'est  passé  en  Angleterre  en 
1859,  lors  de  la fameuse  grève  des  building's  trades  (ouvriers  constructeurs  de  bâti 
ments).  Cette  grève gigantesque  était faite  par plusieurs  milliers  d'ouvriers,  des mil 
liers  de  livres  sterling  ont  été  dépensés  pour  la  soutenir,  toutes  les  associations 
ouvrières  anglaises  ont voulu  contribuer  à  cette  lutte,  toutes  ont  ouvert  leur  caisse. 
Les  patrons  ont  menacé  de  faire  des  importations  en  masse  des  ouvriers  étrangers. 
Les  ouvriers  immédiatement  ont  écrit  à  toutes  les  sociétés  ouvrières  étrangères, 
mais,  n'ayant  pas  les  relations  que  possède  l'Association  internationale,  les  ouvriers 
ont dû  céder après  38  semaines  de  grève.  D'après  ce  fait,  vous  le voyez,  pour mener 
à bonne  fin  la  lutte  que  le  travail  a  entreprise  contre  le  capital,  il  faut  qu'une  publi 
cité  immense  soit  mise  au  service  des  classes  ouvrières.  Et  pour  éviter  l'importation 
des  ouvriers  d'un  pays  à  l'autre,  il  faut  arriver  à  établir  un  salaire  à  peu  près  uni 
forme  et  on  n'y  parviendra  qu'en  aidant  toutes  les  manifestations  tendant  à  élever 
les  salaires  et  à  diminuer  les  heures  de  travail. 

Le  citoyen  Becker  (Allemagne)  fait  la  proposition  suivante : 
Que  les  sociétés  ouvrières  dans  toutes  les  parties  du  monde  soient engagées  à en 
trer  en  communication  les  unes  avec  les  autres  au  moyen  du  conseil  général, 
qu'elles  s'instruisent  réciproquement  sur le  montant  des  salaires,  des  heures  du  tra 
vail,  du mode  de  louer le travail,  etc.  De cette  manière on pourra parvenir à  égaliser 

663 

Association  Internationale des Travailleurs.  Compte  rendu  du  Congrès  de  Genève  (1866) 

les  salaires  dans  les  différents  pays.  Comme  la  question  des  salaires  n'est  pas  natio 
nale  mais  internationale,  nous  engageons  les  ouvriers  des  différents  pays  à  s'assister 
autant  que  possible  par  l'intermédiaire  du  conseil  central  dans  leur  lutte journalière 
contre  le  capital;  et  par  ce  moyen  ils  empêcheront  les  patrons  de  faire  venir  des 
ouvriers  étrangers  pendant  une  lutte  sociale  des  ouvriers  indigènes. 

Adoptée.  8  opposants. 
Le  citoyen  Cornaz  (Suisse)  propose  la  création  des  bureaux  de  renseignements 
dans  chaque  ville  où  les  ouvriers  pourront s'adresser pour trouver  de  l'ouvrage  et les 
patrons  pour  trouver  des  ouvriers. 

Le  citoyen  Card  (Polonais)  condamne  la  grève  en  principe.  C'est  un  moyen  bar 
bare,  dit-il,  qui  confirme  le  salaire  que  nous  voulons  abolir.  C'est  l'association  que 
nous  devons  préconiser,  car  elle  organise  la  classe  ouvrière,  lui  assure  la jouissance 
de  son  travail  et  développe  son  intelligence. 

Le  citoyen Jung  (Londres)  quitte  le  siège  présidentiel,  pour défendre  la grève,  du 
moins telle  que  les  conditions  économiques  l'ont faite  en Angleterre.  Les  grèves  an 
glaises  sont  des  actes  de  défense  contre  les  exactions  infames  des  patrons.  Ordinai 
rement  ce  sont  les  patrons  qui  ferment  leurs  ateliers,  comme  cela  vient  d'arriver 
pour  les  tailleurs  et  les  ouvriers  de  Sheffield.  La  grève,  quoique  coûtant  cher,  rap 
porte  davantage  aux  Anglais  qui  sont  bien  organisés,  soit  qu'elle  soit  faite  pour  di 
minuer  les  heures  de  travail,  soit  pour  une  augmentation  des  salaires. 

Le  citoyen  Card  (Polonais)  et  le  citoyen  Camélinat  (Paris)  protestent  contre  la 

grève  et  ne  croient  pas  aux  bénéfices  que  les  Anglais  en  ont  retirés. 

Le  citoyen  Dupont  (Londres)  dit  que  les  Anglais  ne  préconisent  pas  la  grève 
comme  principe,  mais  comme  moyen  de  lutte.  La  grève,  ajoute-t-il,  a  organisé  la 
classe  ouvrière  anglaise,  et  aucun  pays  Européen  n'offre  un  spectacle  pareil,  et  la 
grève  seule,  dans  la  position  actuelle,  pouvait  accomplir  cette  œuvre ;  l'association, 
réduite  aux  moyens  insignifiants  dont  elle  peut  disposer,  aurait  été  impuissante  à 
atteindre  ce  résultat.  C'est  pourquoi  si  l'on  condamne  la  grève  en  principe  on  doit 
l'admettre  comme  le  seul moyen  de  lutte  dont  dispose  la  classe  ouvrière  ...  Et  reve 
nant  sur le  projet  de  statistique,  il  soumet  à  l'approbation  de  l'assemblée  le  plan  de 
statistique  proposé  par  le  conseil  général,  qui  est  adopté  à  l'unanimité. 

Les  citoyens  Card  (Polonais)  et  Tolain  (Paris)  font  la  proposition  suivante : 
Le  congrès  déclare  que,  dans  l'état  actuel de  l'industrie,  qui  est la guerre,  on  doit 
se  prêter  aide  mutuelle  pour  la  défense  du  salaire,  mais  qu'il  croit  de  son  devoir  de 
déclarer  qu'il y  a  un  but  plus  élevé  à  atteindre,  qui  est  la  suppression  du  salariat.  Il 
recommande  l'étude  des  moyens  économiques  basés  sur la justice  et  la  réciprocité. 

Cette  déclaration  est  adoptée.

I m p ô ts  directs  et  indirects. 

Le  travail  du  conseil  central  sur  cette  question  est  lu.  Après  une  courte  discussion, 
la  délégation  parisienne  soumet  aux  votes  du  congrès  la  proposition  suivante : 

L'impôt  est  la  quote  part  à  payer  par  chacun  pour  acquitter  les  dépenses  géné 
rales:  c'est  donc  un  échange  entre  les  citoyens  et  la  collectivité  représentée  par 
l'Etat.  Les  citoyens  étant  seuls juges  des  services  dont  ils  ont  besoin  et  du  prix qu'il 
leur  convient  d'y  mettre,  ont  donc  seuls  le  droit  de  voter  et  lever  l'impôt. 

L'impôt  doit  être  aussi  direct  que  possible  de  façon  à  ce  que  la  part  de  chacun 

soit  nettement  déterminée  et  sa  juste  répartition  facilement  contrôlée. 

Le  citoyen  Coullery  (La  Chaux-de-Fonds)  voudrait  introduire  un  amendement 
dans cette proposition,  qui tendrait à remplacer les mots :  l'impôt doit être aussi direct 
que  possible,  par  l'impôt  doit  être  direct;  qui  sont  les  propres  termes  du  rapport  an 
glais. 

Mais  après  une  courte  discussion  il  retire  son  amendement,  et  la  proposition  est 

acceptée  par  l'assemblée. 

Art.  VIII  du  p r o g r a m m e. 
Crédit  international. 

Le  citoyen  Fribourg  (Paris)  développe  la  proposition  suivante : 

Io  Le  congrès  met  à  l'étude  le  crédit  international  et  invite  toutes  les  sections  de 
l'Association  à  faire  parvenir  leurs  travaux  sur  ce  point  au  conseil  général,  qui  les 
insérera  dans  le  bulletin,  de  cette  façon  la  question  sera  connue  de  tous  et  pourra 
être  résolue  par  le  prochain  congrès. 

2°  Le  congrès  met  dès  maintenant  à  l'étude  l'idée  d'une  fédération  de  toutes  les 
banques  ouvrières  créées  ou  à  créer  pour  les  relier  plus  tard  par  un  établissement 
central  de  l'Association  internationale  des  travailleurs. 

La  proposition  soutenue  par  le  citoyen  Coullery  (La  Chaux-de-Fonds)  est  adop 

tée  à  l'unanimité. 

Art.  III  du  p r o g r a m m e. 
R é d u c t i on  des  h e u r es  de  travail. 

Le  citoyen  Dupont  (Londres)  lit  le  rapport  du  conseil  central : 

Io  Le  congrès  considère  la  diminution  des  heures  de  travail  comme  un  des  pre 

miers  pas  vers  l'émancipation  du  travailleur. 

2°  Il  propose  que  la journée  de  travail  soit  limitée  à  huit  heures. 
3°  Que  le  travail  de  nuit  ne  doit  être  permis  que  dans  des  cas  exceptionnels  et 

prévus  par  la  loi,  et  seulement  pour  les  hommes. 

La  délégation  française  fait  la  proposition  suivante : 

666 

Séances  du  7  septembre  1866 

Io  L'homme  n'est  libre  qu'à  la  condition  de  développer  toutes  ses  facultés,  en 
conséquence  toute  prolongation  de  travail  qui  le  rendrait  incapable  de  développer 
et de jouir de toutes ses  aptitudes,  doit être  condamné comme anti-physiologique  et 
anti-sociale. 

2°  Dès  à  présent  nous  considérons  un  travail  de  dix  heures  par jour  comme  de 

vant  être  suffisant  à  la  création  des  services  nécessaires  à  la  vie. 

3°  L'Association  doit  donc  faire  tous  ses  efforts  pour  affirmer  l'équivalence  des 
fonctions  en  établissant  un  minimum  de  salaire  rétributaire  du  service  rendu  par 
l'individu  à  la  collectivité. 

10 

Séance  du  7  Septembre  1866. 
Deux  heures  du  soir. 
Président:  le  citoyen  Jung. 

Le  citoyen  Odger  (Londres).  Quant  à  ce  qui  touche  à  la  fixation  du  minimum  du 
salaire,  il  croit  l'exécution  de  ce  projet  difficile.  Mais  il  tient  essentiellement  à  ce 
15  que les  huit heures  de travail proposées par le conseil central soient maintenues  par 
le  congrès.  Huit  heures  de  travail  sont  plus  que  suffisantes  pour  payer  les  dépenses 
de  l'ouvrier;  Elles  sont  suffisant  pour  qu'un  homme  fournisse  grandement  sa  part 
dans  la  production  sociale.  N'oubliez  pas  que  Owen,  le  fameux  communiste,  a  dé 
montré  pièces  en  main  que  trois  heures  de  travail  données  par  tous  les  hommes  se-
raient  assez  pour  produire  la  richesse  sociale  actuelle,  et  songez  que  depuis  Owen, 
les  mécaniques  ont  fait  des  progrès  immenses,  et  que  tous  les  progrès  tendent  à 
abréger  le  travail  humain. 

; 20 

Le  citoyen  Cremer  (Londres)  dit  que  le  citoyen  Odger,  en  parlant  d'un  minimum 
de  salaire,  parle  en  son  nom  personnel,  car  il  croit  qu'il  est  impossible  d'établir  ce 
; 25  minimum.  Dans  cette  proposition,  la  question  vraiment  importante  est  celle  des 
heures  de  travail;  c'est  la  seule  que  nous  devons  résoudre  dans  un  sens  positif,  et 
nous  devons  réclamer  énergiquement  huit  heures  de  travail.  En Amérique,  il  existe 
en ce  moment un grand mouvement  dans  la  classe  ouvrière,  pour réduire  la journée 
de  travail  à huit  heures.  L'Association  internationale  a  été  prise  en  grande  conside 
ration par les prolétaires américains,  précisément  à cause  de  cette question ;  ils sont 
convaincus  que  nous  les  soutiendrons  dans  cette  lutte.  Nous  ne  pouvons  les  aban 
donner  en  demandant  moins  qu'eux.  D'ailleurs,  plus  nous  demanderons,  plus  nous 
obtiendrons.  Dernièrement,  les  ouvriers  en  bâtiments  ont  fait  une  grève  pour  obte 
nir  une  réduction  dans  les  heures  de  travail;  si,  au  lieu  de  neuf  heures,  ils  en 

ro 

35  avaient  réclamé  huit,  ils  auraient  obtenu  ce  qu'il  demandaient. 

Donc,  que  huit  heures  de  travail  soit  le  mot  d'ordre  de  la  classe  ouvrière  de  tous 

les  pays.  Cette  demande  n'est  pas  trop  prétentieuse, je  suppose. 

Le  citoyen  Coullery  (La  Chaux-de-Fonds)  dit  que  c'est  la  plus  importante  ques 
tion  que  le  congrès  puisse  agiter.  Avant  tout,  pour  faire  la  révolution  nous  devons 
40  avoir  des  hommes,  et  le  régime  manufacturier  actuel  les  tue,  les  réduit  au  simple 
rôle  de  rouages.  Huit  heures  de  travail  sont  déjà  trop,  surtout  pour  la  femme.  Les 
capitalistes  eux-mêmes  en Angleterre  ont  commencé  les  premiers  à  demander la ré-

667 

Association  Internationale  des Travailleurs.  Compte  rendu  du  Congrès  de  Genève  (1866) 

duction  des  heures  du  travail,  et  cela  à  leur  point  de  vue  seul,  car  ils  ont  compris 
que  l'excès  du  travail  diminuait  la  force  productive  de  l'animal  humain. 

Le  citoyen  Card  (Pologne).  Nous  n'avons  pas  besoin  d'aller  chercher  nos  exem 
ples  en  Angleterre,  nous  les  trouvons  ici.  Les  patrons  du  canton  de  Saint-Gall  ont 
pris  aussi 
l'initiative  de  ce  mouvement  et  sont  parvenus  à  des  résultats. 
Aujourd'hui,  l'heure  légale  du  travail  est  de  14  heures  pour  les  fabriques,  qui,  de 
même  que  les  maisons  de  tolérance,  sont  soumises  à la  surveillance  de  la  police. 

Le  citoyen  Ch.  Burkli  (Allemagne)  défend  fortement  la  proposition  du  conseil 
central.  Tous  ceux  qui  veulent  l'instruction  du  peuple  doivent  voter  pour  les  huit 
heures  de  travail,  car,  dit-il,  que  pouvez-vous  demander  à  un  homme  qui  travaille 
12  et  14  heures  par jour,  peut-il,  en rentrant  chez  lui,  trouver  la  force  et le  courage 
d'ouvrir  un  livre?  Et  puis,  nous  autres  du  continent,  nous  devons  soutenir  nos 
frères  d'Angleterre  et  d'Amérique  dans  leur  lutte  contre  les  capitalistes  et  ce  serait 
les  trahir  que  de  demander  une  diminution  inférieure  à  leur  réclamation. 

Le  citoyen  Murât  (Paris).  Quoique  le  développement  industriel  ne  soit  pas  par 
tout parvenu  au même  degré,  ce  qui fait  que  les  classes  ouvrières  des  différents pays 
ne  sont  pas  dans  les  mêmes  positions  dans  leur  lutte  contre  le  capital,  et  que  par 
conséquent  des  lois  générales  s'appliquant  à  tous  les  pays  ne  peuvent  être  prises, 
cependant  ici  nous  ne  pouvons  faire  rien  de  mieux  que  d'encourager  par  notre 
approbation  le  mouvement  des  classes  ouvrières  anglaise  et  américaine,  car  ces 
pays  sont  ceux  où  l'industrie  est  la  plus  développée,  et  quand  la  France  aura  un 
développement  semblable,  nous  serons  obligés  de  faire  la  même  demande ;  et nous 
serons  heureux  de  trouver  le  précédent  approuvé  par  le  premier  congrès  ouvrier. 

Le  citoyen Fribourg  (Paris)  dit  qu'ils  ne  demandent pas  une  réduction  semblable, 
la  délégation  parisienne  tient  seulement  à  ce  que  le  travail  des  ouvriers  ne  soit  pas 
défavorable  au  développement  naturel  de  leurs  facultés  et  aptitudes;  et  qu'elle  ne 
croit  pas  qu'il  soit  possible  d'établir  aucune  réglementation  à  ce  sujet. 

L'extrait  du  rapport  du  conseil  central  qui  a  trait  aux  heures  de  travail,  est  mis 

aux  voix  et  adopté  à  la  majorité.  Dix  opposants. 

La  délégation  parisienne  présente  cette  proposition : 
Que  l'Association  doit  faire  tous  ses  efforts  pour  affirmer  l'équivalence  des  fonc 
tions  en  établissant  le  minimum  de  salaire  rétributif du  service  rendu  par  l'individu 
à  la  collectivité. 

Elle  est  adoptée  à  l'unanimité. 

Art.  IV  du  p r o g r a m m e. 
Travail  des  femmes  et  des  enfants. 

Le  citoyen  Dupont  (Londres)  donne  lecture  du  rapport  du  conseil  central. 

Le  congrès  doit  s'occuper  sérieusement  de  l'apprenti.  Un  contrat  existe  entre  le 
patron  et  l'apprenti.  Celui-ci  est  tenu  de  le  remplir,  et  le  patron  s'en  moque,  car, 
pendant la durée  de l'apprentissage,  l'enfant est  exploité  de  toute manière par le pa 
tron,  qui le  fait  servir  à toutes  sortes  de  travaux  en  dehors  de  sa profession ;  aussi ne 
commence-t-il  à  apprendre  son  métier  que  du jour  où  il  a  fini  son  apprentissage  et 

668 

Séances du  7 septembre  1866 

devient  ouvrier.  Nous  devons  nous  appesantir  sur  cette  question,  car  l'exploitation 
de  l'enfant  a  quelque  chose  de  plus  inique  que  celle  de  l'homme. 

Le  citoyen  Coullery  (La  Chaux-de-Fonds).  Je  suis  heureux  de  voir  le  congrès 

s'occuper  de  la femme ;  nous  devons  déclarer d'une  façon  catégorique  que  nous  tra 
vaillons  aussi  bien  pour  l'émancipation  de  la  femme  que  pour  celle  de  l'homme.  Il 
faut  que  non-seulement  nous  l'arrachions  à  la  prostitution  de  la  rue,  mais  encore  à 
celle  de  l'atelier.  Il  faut  que,  comme  celle  de  l'homme,  son  instruction  soit  com 
plète,  pour  qu'elle  ne  devienne  la proie  des  ministres  d'aucune  religion.  En  un  mot, 
il faut  qu'elle  puisse  se  développer  complètement,  cérébralement  et  corporellement, 
car  elle  est  l'espoir  de  l'espèce  humaine. 

Les  citoyens  Chemalé,  Fribourg,  Perrachon,  Camélinat  font  la  proposition  sui 

vante : 

Au  point  de  vue  physique,  moral  et  social,  le  travail  des  femmes  et  des  enfants 
dans  les  manufactures  doit  être  énergiquement  condamné  en  principe  comme  une 
des  causes  les  plus  actives  de  la  dégénérescence  de  l'espèce  humaine  et  comme  un 
des  plus  puissants  moyens  de  démoralisation  mis  en  œuvre  par  la  caste  capitaliste. 
La femme,  ajoutent-ils,  n'est  point faite  pour travailler,  sa  place  est  au  foyer  de  la 
famille,  elle  est  l'educatrice  naturelle  de  l'enfant,  elle  seule peut  le  préparer  à  l'exis 
tence  civique,  mâle  et libre.  Cette  question  doit  être  mise  à  l'ordre  du jour  du  pro 
chain  congrès,  la  statistique  fournira  des  documents  assez  puissants  pour  que  nous 
puissions  condamner  le  travail  des  femmes  dans  les  manufactures. 

Le  citoyen  Varlin  (Paris).  Comme  vous  tous,  je  reconnais  que  le  travail  des 
femmes  dans  les  manufactures,  tel  qu'il  se  pratique,  ruine  le  corps  et  engendre  la 
corruption.  Mais  partant  de  ce  fait,  nous  ne  pouvons  condamner  le  travail  des 
femmes  d'une manière générale;  car vous  qui voulez  enlever la femme  à la prostitu 
tion,  comment  pourrez-vous  le  faire  si  vous  ne  lui  donnez  le  moyen  de  gagner  sa 
vie.  Que deviendront les veuves et les orphelines?  Elles seront obligées ou de tendre 
la  main  ou  de  se  prostituer.  Condamner  le  travail  des  femmes,  c'est  reconnaître  la 
charité  et  autoriser  la  prostitution. 

Le  citoyen  Fribourg  (Paris).  Les  veuves  et  les  orphelines  seront  toujours  une  ex 
ception  et  ne  peuvent  en  aucune  façon  infirmer  la  loi  que  nous  posons.  Car,  dit-il, 
en  voulant  que  tous  les  hommes  travaillent,  nous  savons  parfaitement  que  beau 
coup  en  seront  empêchés  par  des  accidents  naturels,  et  cependant  nous  réclamons 
la loi générale.  Les veuves  et les  orphelines  sont  dans  le même  cas  que  les  infirmes. 
Le  citoyen  Tolain  (Paris).  Tant  que  la  manufacture  existera  pour  la  femme,  elle 
ne  sera jamais  un  être  libre,  elle  ne  pourra jamais  développer  ses  facultés  naturelles. 
L'atelier  l'abâtardit. 

Le  citoyen Lawrence  (Londres).  Il y  a  quelque  chose  de plus  fort  que tous  les rai 
sonnements  que  nous  tenons  ici,  de  plus  vrai  que  tous  les  sentiments philanthropi 
ques  que  nous  émettons :  c'est  la  marche  de  la  Société.  Nous  ne  devons  pas  faire 
des  théories,  nous  sommes  des  ouvriers,  des  hommes  pratiques  et  non  des  uto 
pistes.  Eh  bien !  si  nous  voulons  aider d'une  façon  efficace  l'émancipation  de  notre 
classe,  il  faut  que  notre  rôle  se  borne  à  observer  ce  qui  se  passe  autour  de  nous,  à 
comprendre  le  mouvement  social  et  non  à  lui  imposer  nos  sentiments  et  nos  vues 
particulières.  Comme  le  rapport  du  conseil  central  le  dit  très  bien  la  tendance  de 

669 

Association  Internationale  des  Travailleurs.  Compte  rendu  du  Congrès  de  Genève  (1866) 

l'industrie  moderne,  est  de  faire  coopérer  la  femme  et  l'enfant  à  la  production  so 
ciale.  Et  ceci  est tellement vrai  que  dans  certaines  parties  de  l'Angleterre,  la  femme 
ne  demeure  plus  à  la  maison,  et  c'est  l'homme  qui  est  réduit  à  faire  la  cuisine. 
Nous  sommes  cependant  loin  d'admirer  la  manière  dont  on  fait  travailler  la  femme¿ 
mais  le  fait  existe  et  ce  serait  folie  que  de  vouloir  condamner  d'une  façon  générale 
le  travail  de  la  femme;  mais  ce  que  nous  pouvons  faire,  c'est  protester  énergique-
ment  contre  l'exploitation  de  la  femme  telle  que  la  pratique  la  caste  capitaliste. 

L'extrait  du  rapport  du  conseil  central,  concernant  le  travail  des  femmes,  est  mis 

aux  voix  et  voté  à  la  grande  majorité. 

L'amendement  suivant,  présenté  par  les  citoyens  Varlin  (Paris)  et  Bourdon  (Pa 

ris),  tendant  à  accentuer  davantage  le  rapport  anglais,  est  mis  aux  voix  et  rejeté. 

Le  manque  d'éducation,  l'excès  de  travail,  la  rémunération  trop  minime  et  les 
mauvaises  conditions  hygiéniques  des  manufactures  sont  actuellement  pour  les 
femmes  qui  y  travaillent  des  causes  d'abaissement  physique  et  moral ;  ces  causes 
peuvent  être  détruites  par  une  meilleure  organisation  du  travail,  par  la  co-opéra-
tion.  La  femme  ayant  besoin  de  travailler  pour vivre  honorablement,  on  doit  cher 
cher  à  améliorer  son travail  et  non  à le  supprimer.  Quant  aux  enfants,  on  doit  retar 
der  leur  entrée  dans  la  fabrique  et  restreindre  autant  que  possible  la  durée  de  leur 
travail. 

La  proposition  des  citoyens  Chemalé,  Fribourg,  Perrachon,  Camélinat,  est  mise 

aux  voix  et  adoptée. 

Au  sujet  de  l'éducation  des  enfants,  la  délégation  française  fait  la  proposition 

suivante,  qui  est  adoptée  à  l'unanimité : 

Le  congrès  déclare  que  l'enseignement  professionnel  doit  être  théorique  et  prati 
que,  sous  peine  de  voir  se  constituer  une  aristocratie  à  l'aide  de  l'instruction  spé 
ciale,  qui  ferait  non  des  artisans,  mais  des  directeurs  d'ouvriers.

Art.  10  du  p r o g r a m m e. 
Des  armées  p e r m a n e n t es  et  de  leurs  rapports  avec  la  production. 

Le  citoyen  Dupont  (Londres)  ouvre  la  discussion  en  lisant  le  rapport  du  conseil 
central  ayant  trait  à  ce  sujet. 

Le  citoyen  Vuilleumier  (Chaux-de-Fonds)  propose  la  résolution  suivante : 
a)  Le  congrès  reconnaît  que  le  système  d'armées  permanentes  est  contraire  à  la 

marche  et  au  développement  actuel  de  l'organisation  sociale. 

b)  Que  sachant  l'impossibilité  de  changer  immédiatement  cet  état  de  choses,  il 

670 

Séances  du  8 septembre  1866 

n'en  est  pas  moins pénétré  d'une  grande  confiance  que  l'association  de  tous  les  tra 
vailleurs  devra  amener  leur  disparition. 

5 

La  délégation  française  fait  les  propositions  suivantes: 
a) Les  armées  permanentes  enlèvent  aux  travaux  pacifiques  les  hommes  les  plus 
robustes pour les rendre  à la  société  (si  elles  les  rendent)  incapables  d'un  travail ré 
gulier.  L'emploi  qu'on  en  fait,  tant  à  l'intérieur  qu'à  l'extérieur,  augmente  encore 
les  dangers  qu'elles  font  courir  à  la  production. 

b) Le  système  de  milice,  c'est-à-dire  de  la  nation  entière  armée,  est le  seul  qu'on 

puisse  admettre  à  titre  de  transition. 

10 

c)  Le  congrès  voyant  avec  bonheur  les  efforts  tentés  pour  l'abolition  des  armées 
permanentes,  de  l'extinction  de  la  guerre  et  de  l'antagonisme  international,  té 
moigne  ses  sympathies  à  tous  ceux  qui  se  sont  préoccupés  de  répandre  ces  idées  et 
en  particulier  aux  fondateurs  de  la  Ligue  du  bien  public. 

Le  citoyen  Heidt  (Allemand)  fait  la  proposition  suivante:  appuyée  par  les  ci-

15 

toyens  Rau  et  Burkli  (Allemands) : 

Le  congrès  recommande  aux  sections  de  former  partout  où  les  circonstances  le 
permettront,  des  sociétés  d'exercices  militaires,  autant  que  possible  sur  les  mêmes 
bases  et  selon  les  mêmes  principes,  pour  accélérer l'armement général  du  peuple. 

Le  citoyen  Heidt.  Déjà  il  existe  des  sociétés  pareilles  en  Allemagne,  et  là  où  les 
20  gouvernements  défendent  ces  exercices,  dans  les  cercles  gymnastiques  on  remplace 

les  fusils  par  des  bâtons. 

Toute  l'assemblée  approuve  les  principes  développés  par  les  orateurs,  et  admet 

toutes  les  résolutions. 

25 

Article  XI  du  p r o g r a m m e. 
Des  idées  religieuses,  de  leur  influence  sur  le  développement 
social,  politique  et  individuel. 

La  délégation  française  soumet  la  proposition  suivante : 

Le  congrès  affirme  la  liberté  physique  et  intellectuelle  de  l'espèce  humaine  et 
constate  que l'influence  des  idées religieuses tend  à nier le libre-arbitre  et la  dignité 
30  de  l'homme;  cependant,  toutes  les  idées  religieuses  se  dérobant  aux  investigations 
de  la raison,  le  congrès  se  borne  à protester contre  cette  influence  et  à passer outre. 
Le  citoyen  Peter  (Allemagne).  Aujourd'hui  nous  ne  devons  plus  confondre  la  re 
ligion  et  la  morale,  ce  sont  deux  choses  distinctes,  contradictoires  même.  Il  faut 
que  nous  réclamions  énergiquement  leur  séparation  complète  et  que  nous  réunis-
sions  tous  nos  efforts  pour  combattre  la religion,  qui  a  engendré  plus  de  maux  que 
les  armées  permanentes. 

35 

Le  citoyen  Coullery  (Chaux-de-Fonds).  La  morale  a  été  attachée  aux  flancs  de  la 
religion,  qui en  a fait sa vassale  et l'a  traînée  dans  toute  espèce  de mauvais  lieux ;  et 
l'a  fait  servir  à  excuser,  à  autoriser  même  tous  ses  crimes ;  il faut  que  nous  émanci-
40  pions  la morale  de  cette  tutelle.  La  morale  doit  trouver  sa  base  dans  la  raison  et  la 
science ;  ainsi  élaborée,  elle  doit  être  inculquée  aux  enfants ;  il  faut  donc  que  l'en 
seignement  religieux  soit  banni  d'une  manière  absolue  des  écoles. 

671 

Association  Internationale des Travailleurs.  Compte  rendu  du  Congrès de  Genève (1866) 

Le  citoyen  Muller  (Allemagne)  s'élève  contre  la  confusion  de  la  morale  et  de  la 
religion. La religion pervertit la morale.  C'est surtout dans les campagnes que la re 
ligion  exerce  ses  ravages,  c'est  là  surtout  qu'il  faut  réclamer  le  bannissement  de  la 
religion  et  l'enseignement  de  la  morale  rationaliste. 

Le  citoyen  Schlaifer  (Allemagne)  développe  l'antagonisme  de  la  religion  et  de  la 

morale,  et  s'élève  contre  l'influence  cléricale. 

Le  citoyen  Card  (Pologne)  combat  l'enseignement  religieux  surtout  pour  la 

femme. 

Le  citoyen  Bocquin  (Montreux)  réclame  énergiquement  la  séparation  de  la  mo 

rale  et  de  la  religion. 

Les citoyens Vuilleumier (Suisse)  et  Schwitzguébel (Allemagne)  émettent la pro 

position  suivante : 

Que  le  congrès  déclare  qu'il  veut  la  liberté  de  conscience,  la  séparation  de 
l'Eglise  de  l'Etat  et  l'exclusion  dans  toutes  les  écoles  de  toute  espèce  d'enseigne 
ment  religieux. 

Le  citoyen  Tolain  (Paris).  Les  progrès  de  la  science  détruiront  les  préjugés  reli 
gieux  et ramèneront l'homme  au  sentiment de  la  dignité.  Il propose  que  le  Congrès 
n'approuve  aucune  résolution. 

Tous  les  membres  du  Congrès  ont  été  unanimes  sur  la  nécessité  de  débarrasser 
l'homme  de toute  espèce de préjugés religieux ;  et,  en  constatant l'unanimité  de ses 
membres,  l'assemblée  passe  à  l'ordre  du jour. 

Art.  IX  du  p r o g r a m m e. 
De  la  riécessité  d'anéantir  l'influence  du  despotisme 
et  de  l'absolutisme  de  la  Russie  en  E u r o p e, 
par  l'application  du  droit  des  peuples  de  disposer  d ' e u x - m ê m es 
et  de  reconstruire  u ne  Pologne 
sur  des  bases  d é m o c r a t i q u es  et  sociales. 

Les  citoyens  Card  et  Becker  (Pologne  et  Allemagne)  voulaient  que  le  Congrès  se 
prononçât  affirmativement  sur  cette  question ;  mais  l'assemblée  la  rangeant  parmi 
les  questions  politiques,  l'a  écartée  du  débat en  laissant aux membres  allemands  et 
suisses  la  faculté  de  signer  la  proposition  de  Becker  en  faveur  de  la  reconstitution 
de  la  Pologne. 

Considérant que  par  le  développement  et  la consolidation  de  l'Association  inter 
nationale  des  travailleurs  tout  despotisme  disparaîtra,  la  reconstruction  de  la  Po 
logne  démocratique  et  sociale  se  fera  d'elle-même.

Etablissement  des  Sociétés  de  secours  m u t u e l s. 
A p p ui  moral  et  m a t é r i el  accordé  a ux  orphelins  de  l'Association. 

Le  citoyen  Dupleix  (Suisse)  dit  que  toutes  les  personnes  qui ont  adhéré  à l'Associa 
tion  internationale  ont  réclamé  la  création  d'une  institution  générale  de  secours 
mutuels.  Les  différentes  sociétés  de  secours  mutuels  étant  locales,  beaucoup 
d'ouvriers  perdaient  leurs  droits  en  changeant  de  pays.  La  section  de  Genève  a  es-
sayé  de  fonder une  association  comprenant:  secours  en  cas  de  maladie,  crédit  mu 
tuel  et  appui  donné  aux  orphelins  de  l'Association.  La  section  de  Genève  demande 
au  Congrès  son  appui,  afin  que  cette  Association  devienne  internationale ;  car  son 
établissement  nous  aidera  puissamment  à  atteindre  le  but  que  nous  nous  propo 
sons. 

15 

Le  citoyen Becker  (Allemagne)  voudrait qu'on laissât à  chaque  section  le  soin  de 
fonder  sa  société  de  secours ;  et  qu'on  les  engageât  à  consacrer  une  partie  de  leurs 
fonds  à  cette  œuvre. 

Le  citoyen  Chemalé  (Paris)  serait  d'avis  de  fédéraliser ces  diverses  sociétés  de  se 
cours  mutuels ;  mais  il  est  difficile  de  réaliser  cette  idée  en  France ;  les  sociétés  de 
secours  mutuels  se  trouvant  dans  la  main  du  gouvernement  et  leur  argent  étant 
versé  dans  les  coffres  de  l'Etat. 

20 

Le  citoyen  Bocquin  (Montreux)  prétend  que  la  société  de  Genève  résout  toutes 
les  difficultés  qu'on  pourrait  rencontrer  dans  les  différents  pays.  Pour  cela  chaque 
société  n'aurait  qu'à  tirer  à  vue  sur  la  branche  à  laquelle  appartient  le  membre  se-
25  couru,  afin  de  rentrer  dans  ses  avances ;  et  il  pense  que  ce  moyen  serait  parfaite 

ment  applicable  en  France. 

Le  citoyen  Muller fait,  au  nom  de  la section  de  Stuttgart,  la proposition  suivante : 
Un  seul  règlement  doit  régir  toutes  les  associations  de  secours  fédérées,  sans 
quoi  le  but  international  serait  manqué.  Déjà  en  Allemagne,  en  Suisse,  etc.,  il 
30  existe  des  sociétés  de  secours  de  ce  genre  qui  sont  loin  de  pouvoir  suffire  aux  be 
soins;  ce  n'est  qu'en  fondant  une  masse  énorme  dans  une  seule  association  que 
l'on  pourra  obtenir  de  meilleurs  résultats. 

En  conséquence,  une  organisation  centrale  nous  paraît  indispensable.  Elle  rece 
vrait  les  cotisations  de  toutes  les  sections  et  serait  chargée  de  pourvoir à  leurs  frais. 
35  Ce  que nous vous proposons là  est déjà mis  en pratique par les  assurances  sur la vie, 

contre  l'incendie,  etc.,  on  n'aurait  qu'à  suivre  leur  exemple. 

La  délégation  anglaise  fait  la  proposition  suivante : 
Que  ce  Congrès  approuve  entièrement  les  mesures  prises  par  la  section  de  Ge 
nève  dans  l'établissement  de  sociétés  de  secours  mutuels,  et  qu'il  recommande  au 
40  conseil  central  d'étudier  les  meilleurs moyens  à  adopter pour établir le  principe  sur 

une  base  internationale.

Association  Internationale  des  Travailleurs.  Compte  rendu  du  Congrès  de  Genève  (1866) 

La  proposition  est  mise  aux  voix  et  adoptée. 
Les  délégations  lyonnaise  et  parisienne  émettent  le  vœu  suivant : 
L'assemblée  des  délégués,  en reconnaissant  qu'il  est  désirable  qu'il  soit établi des 
sociétés  de  prévoyance  et de  secours  mutuels,  ne  croit pas  cependant  devoir en faire 
pour  le  moment  l'objet  d'une  mesure  générale,  et  laisse  sous  ce  rapport  chaque 
groupe  libre  de  se  constituer  dans  son  sein  ces  sociétés,  ainsi  que  celle  de  crédit. 
Elle  fait de  plus  appel  aux  sections  qui  sont  entrées  dans  cette  voie  pour établir une 
statistique spéciale  destinée  à  favoriser  le  développement  de  ces  sociétés. 

Adopté  à  l'unanimité. 

Art. XIII  du  p r o g r a m m e. 
Discussion  des  règlements  spéciaux. 

Le  citoyen  Coullery  donne  lecture  des  statuts,  article  par  article,  qui  sont  votés  sé 
parément. 

Les  articles  1,  2  et  3  sont  adoptés  à  l'unanimité. 
L'article  4  ayant  trait  à  la  cotisation  annuelle  de  chaque  membre,  devient le  sujet 

de  la  discussion  suivante : 

Le  citoyen  Dupleix  (Suisse)  dit  que  cet  article  ne  concerne  que  les  membres  in 
dividuels,  les  différentes  sociétés  adhérant  aux  principes  de  l'Association  interna 
tionale, versant une somme annuelle sans  avoir égard au nombre de leurs membres. 
Le  citoyen  Coullery  désirerait  que  les  membres  des  diverses  associations  eussent 

à  verser  une  somme  moins  forte. 

La  délégation  française  propose,  au  contraire,  que  la  cotisation  soit  personnelle 

et  par  conséquent  égale  pour  tous. 

Le  citoyen  Lawrence  (Londres)  voudrait  qu'on  n'épouvantât  pas  les  différentes 
sociétés  adhérentes,  et  qu'on  encourageât  leurs  efforts  en  faisant  une  diminution  en 
leur  faveur. 

Le  citoyen  Fribourg  (Paris).  Il  y  aurait  inégalité  de  droits,  puisqu'il y  aurait  iné 
galité  de  devoirs ;  aussi  conclut-il  à  ce  que  tous  les  membres  supportent  les  mêmes 
charges. 

Le  citoyen  Chemalé  (Paris)  dit  qu'en  principe  il  faudrait  que  tous  les  sociétaires 
eussent  à payer la même  contribution :  néanmoins,  il  propose  qu'en raison  de  la si 
tuation  exceptionnelle  des  sociétés  anglaises  déjà  adhérentes  et  de  celles  qui  pour 
raient  s'adjoindre,  on  fit  une  réduction  de  50 p. c.  en  leur  faveur. 

Le citoyen Camélinat (Paris)  croit qu'on ne peut établir une cotisation inégale sans 

faillir  à  la  devise  de  l'Association  internationale :  Pas de  devoirs sans droits. 

La  discussion  sur  ce  sujet  continue  pendant  un  temps  assez  long  encore;  les 
citoyens  Varlin,  Fribourg,  etc.  prennent  tour  à  tour  la  parole,  et  se  prononcent 
pour  que  la  cotisation  de  0  fr.  30 c.  soit  établie  exceptionnellement  pour  l'année 
1866-1867,  et  qu'elle  soit  individuelle. 
L'article  est  mis  aux  voix  et  adopté.

Séances  du  8  septembre  1866 

Le Courrier  International. 
Nr. 16, 20. April  1867 

Les  articles  5,  6,  7,  8,  9  et  10  sont  adoptés  à  l'unanimité. 

L'article  11  ainsi conçu :  Chaque  membre  de  l'association  a  le  droit de participer 

au  vote  et  d'être  élu,  devient  le  sujet  de  la  discussion  suivante : 

Le  citoyen Tolain  (Paris).  S'il est  indifférent  d'admettre,  comme membre  de  l'As 
sociation  internationale,  des  citoyens  de  toute  classe  travailleur  ou  non;  il  ne  doit 
pas  en  être  de  même,  lorsqu'il  s'agit  de  choisir un  délégué.  En présence  de  l'organi 
sation  sociale  actuelle  dans  laquelle  la  classe  ouvrière  soutient  une  lutte  sans  trêve 
ni  merci  contre  la  classe  bourgeoise,  il  est  utile,  indispensable  même,  que  tous  les 
hommes  qui  sont  chargés  de  représenter  des  groupes  ouvriers  soient  des  travail 
leurs. 

Le  citoyen  Perrachon  (Paris)  parle  dans  le  même  sens,  et va plus  loin,  car  il  croit 
que  ce  serait vouloir la  perte  de  l'association,  que  d'admettre  comme  délégué  un  ci 
toyen  qui  ne  serait  pas  ouvrier. 

Le  citoyen  Vuilleumier  (Suisse)  en  éliminant  quelqu'un  de  notre  association, 
nous  nous  mettrions  en  contradiction  avec  nos  règlements  généraux,  qui  admettant 
dans  son  sein  tout individu  sans  distinction  de  race,  ni  de  couleur,  et par le  seul fait 
de  son  admission  il  est  apte  à  prétendre  à  l'homme  d'être  délégué. 

Le  citoyen  Cremer  (Londres)  s'étonne  de  voir  cette  question  revenir  de  nouveau 
à la  discussion,  il n'en  comprend  pas  la nécessité,  car,  dit-il,  parmi les  membres  du 
conseil  central  se  trouvent  plusieurs  citoyens  qui  n'exercent  pas  de  métiers  ma 
nuels,  et  qui  n'ont  donné  aucun  motif de  suspicion,  loin  de  là  il  est  probable  que 
sans  leurs  dévouement  l'association  n'aurait  pu  s'implanter  en  Angleterre  d'un  fa 
çon  aussi  complète.  Parmi  ces  membres je vous  citerai  un seul,  le  citoyen  Marx,  qui 
a  consacré  toute  sa  vie  au  triomphe  de  la  classe  ouvrière. 

Le  citoyen  Carter  (Londres) :  On  vient  de  vous  parler  du  citoyen  Karl  Marx,  il  a 
compris  parfaitement l'importance  de  ce  premier congrès,  où  seulement  devaient  se 
trouver  des  délégués  ouvriers,  aussi,  a-t-il  refusé  la  délégation  qu'on  lui  offrait  dans 
le  conseil  central.  Mais  ce  n'est  point  une  raison  pour  l'empêcher  lui  ou  tout  autre, 
de venir  au  milieu de  nous,  au contraire,  des hommes  se  dévouant entièrement  à  la 
cause  prolétaire  sont  trop  rares  pour  les  écarter  de  notre  route.  La  bourgeoisie  n'a 
triomphé  que  du  jour  où  riche  et  puissante,  par  le  nombre  elle  s'est  alliée  à  la 
science,  et  c'est  la  prétendue  science  économique  bourgeoise,  qui,  en  lui  donnant 
du prestige,  maintient  encore  son  pouvoir;  que  les  hommes  qui  se  sont  occupés  de 
la  question  économique,  et  qui  ont  reconnu  la justice  de  notre  cause  et  la  nécessité 
d'une  réforme  sociale,  viennent  au  congrès  ouvrier  battre  en  brèche  la  science  éco 
nomique  bourgeoise. 

Le  citoyen  Tolain  (Paris).  Comme  ouvrier je  remercie  le  citoyen  Marx  de  n'avoir 
pas  accepté  la  délégation  qu'on  lui  offrait.  En  faisant  cela  le  citoyen Marx  a montré 
que  les  congrès  ouvriers  devaient  être  seulement  composés  d'ouvriers  manuels.  Si 
ici nous  admettons  des  hommes  appartenant à d'autres  classes,  on  ne manquera pas 
de  dire  que  le  congrès  ne  représente  pas  les  aspirations  des  classes  ouvrières,  qu'il 
n'est  pas  fait  pour  des  travailleurs,  et je  crois  qu'il  est  utile  de  montrer  au  monde 
que  nous  sommes  assez  avancés  pour  pouvoir  agir  par  nous-mêmes.

Association  Internationale  des Travailleurs.  Compte  rendu  du  Congrès  de  Genève  (1866) 

L'amendement  du  citoyen  Tolain  voulant  la  qualité  d'ouvriers  manuels  pour  re 

cevoir  le  titre  de  délégué,  est  mis  aux  voix  et  est  rejeté,  20  pour  et  25  contre. 
L'article  11  est  mis  aux  voix  et  adopté  à  la  majorité,  10  votant  contre. 
Les  articles  12,  13,  14,  15  sont votés  à  l'unanimité. 
L'assemblée  décide  par  un  vote  que  le  siège  du  conseil  central  pour  l'année 

1866-67  sera  Londres. 

Le  citoyen  Eccarius  (Londres)  propose  que  les  pouvoirs  de  l'ancien  conseil  cen 

tral  soient  continués. 

La  délégation  parisienne  veut  bien  appuyer  la  proposition,  mais  par  l'intermé 
diaire  du  citoyen  Fribourg  elle  demande  l'élimination  du  conseil  central  du  citoyen 
Le  Lubez  comme  s'étant  rendu  coupable  d'imputations  calomniatrices  contre  lui, 
Fribourg,  et  contre  le  citoyen  Tolain  en  particulier,  et  contre  la  section  parisienne 
de  l'association  internationale  en  général. 

Une  discussion  très-grave  s'engage  à  ce  sujet,  les  citoyens  Fribourg  et  Tolain  de 
mandent  à  ce  que  la  délégation  du  conseil  central  réponde,  si  oui  ou  non,  les  faits 
avancés  par  eux  et  concernant  le  citoyen  Le  Lubez  sont  vrais. 

La  délégation  du  conseil  central  ayant  répondu  qu'en  effet  le  citoyen  Le  Lubez 
s'était  rendu  coupable  des  calomnies  dénoncées.  L'assemblée  déclare  qu'un  mem 
bre  du  conseil  central  ayant failli  au  contrat  de  l'association  en  répandant  des  accu 
sations  fausses  sans  les  appuyer  d'aucune  preuve,  ni  même  d'aucun  semblant  de 
preuves,  ce  membre  devrait  être  rayé  de  la  liste  des  membres  du  conseil  central. 

L'assemblée  adopte  ensuite  sur  les  citoyens  Fribourg  et  Tolain  la  résolution  sui 

vante:  -

Le  congrès  déclare  que  les  citoyens  Fribourg  et  Tolain  n'ont jamais  démérité  de 

l'association,  et  que  leur  conduite  a  toujours  été  loyale. 

L'assemblée  porte  alors  le  nombre  des  membres  du  conseil central  à  50,  et  décide 

que  leurs  pouvoirs  soient  prolongés. 

Sur la proposition  du  citoyen  Cornaz  qui  a  été  chargé  d'en  faire  la  demande,  l'as 
semblée  décide  à  l'unanimité  que  le  prochain  congrès  se  tiendra  à  Lausanne  et  que 
le jour  du  congrès  sera  fixé  au  premier  lundi  de  septembre  de  l'année  1867. 

Le  citoyen  Cremer  (Londres)  propose  que  tous  les  délégués  en  restant  dans  leurs 
pays fassent  des  efforts  pour  amener leurs  gouvernements  à  établir une  taxe  postale 
unique,  qui  réduirait  à  0,10 c  (1  penny),  le  port  de  lettres  d'une  nation  à  l'autre.  Il 
propose  qu'une  commission  soit  nommée pour aller  à  Genève,  Berne,  Paris,  et  Lon 
dres  faire  cette  demande. 

L'assemblée  adopte  la proposition  du  citoyen  Cremer  et nomme  comme  commis

Résolutions  du  Congrès Ouvrier Américain  de  1866 

[Extraits  d es  A p p e n d i c e s] 

Le Courrier International. 
Nr. 17, 27. April 1867 

Résolutions  du  Congrès  Ouvrier  Américain  de  1866. 

Tandis  que  le  Congrès  de  l'Association  internationale  des  travailleurs  se  tenait  à 
Genève,  les  ouvriers  américains  se  réunissaient,  eux  aussi,  pour  formuler  leurs 
* 5  vœux  et  leurs  aspirations.  Comme  la  classe  prolétarienne  se  trouve  unie  par  le 
même lien,  la même nécessité  de  s'organiser pour pouvoir résister à la  classe  capita 
liste  et  pour  arriver  à  son  entière  émancipation ;  nous  croyons  utile  de  faire  suivre 
les  résolutions  du  congrès  genevois  par  ceux  du  congrès  américain,  tenu  à  Balti 
more le  20  août  1866.  La classe ouvrière  européenne sera heureuse  de constater que 
le  mouvement  ouvrier  n'est  pas  seulement  concentré  en  Europe,  mais  s'affirme 
aussi  en  Amérique  d'une  manière  d'autant  plus  énergique  que  la  liberté  politique 
dont jouit  ce  pays  a  appris  aux  prolétaires  américains  à  n'accepter  aucun  compro 
mis  avec  les  meneurs  de  la  classe  bourgeoise. 

10 

I 

15  «Attendu  qu'un  congrès  international  d'ouvriers  va  avoir  lieu  dans  la  ville  de  Ge 
nève,  et  comme  l'époque  en  est  trop  rapprochée  pour pouvoir y  envoyer un  délégué 
représentant  les  Etats-Unis,  nous  proposons : 

20 

Que  le  conseil  exécutif de  l'Association  nationale  des  travailleurs  soit  chargé  de 
faire  parvenir  les  souhaits  de  cette  convention  à  l'Association  internationale  des 
travailleurs  avec une  copie  des  débats  de  cette  assemblée,  priant  Dieu  de  les  aider 
dans  leur  glorieuse  entreprise ;  et  que  le  conseil  exécutif soit  autorisé  d'envoyer un 
délégué  au  congrès  européen,  s'il  avait  lieu,  avant  la  prochaine  réunion  de  notre 
convention. » 

II 

25  «Attendu  que  l'histoire  et  la  législation  du  passé  ont  démontré  ce  fait  qu'aucune 
confiance ne  peut  être  accordée  dans  les  questions  touchant les  intérêts  des  classes 
ouvrières,  aux  professions  de  foi  et  aux  garanties  des  partis  politiques  existants, 

Il  est  résolu : 
Que  le  temps  est  venu  pour la  classe  ouvrière  américaine  de  briser  tous  les  liens 
30  et toutes les  affections  qui  l'attachaient aux anciens partis  et  de s'organiser en Ligue 
du  travail  national.  L'objet  de  cette  ligue  sera  d'abord  de  forcer  le  congrès  national 
et les  législatures d'Etat de promulguer une  loi réduisant à  huit heures  la journée  de 
travail  et  de  nommer  des  hommes  chargés  de  soutenir  et  de représenter  les  intérêts 
de la  classe  ouvrière ; 

677 

Association  Internationale  des Travailleurs.  Compte  rendu  du  Congrès  de  Genève  (1866) 

Que  les  moyens  les  plus  efficaces  pour  arriver  aux  résultats  désirés  sont  une  agi 
tation  systématique  et  l'établissement  de  ligues  de  huit  heures  de  travail  avec  le 
concours  de  la  presse  et  des  orateurs  publics ;  et  ce  congrès  recommande  à  tous  ses 
membres  à  leur retour dans  leurs foyers  de  démontrer  à  leurs  camarades  ouvriers la 
nécessité  d'une  organisation  immédiate; 

Que  dans  l'intention  de  mettre  à  exécution  les  résolutions  du  congrès,  nous  re 
commandons  à  tout  ami  du  mouvement  ouvrier  de  n'accorder  son  vote  qu'au  can 
didat  qui,  sans  équivoque,  reconnaîtrait  la  nécessité  de  promulguer  une  loi  rédui 
sant  à  huit  heures  la  journée  de  travail  et  qui  consentirait  à  réclamer  toutes  les 
réformes  demandées  par  le  mouvement  ouvrier; 

Que  partout  où  un  ouvrier  offrirait  les  garanties  exigées  pour  remplir  n'importe 

quel  emploi,  il  soit  choisi  de  préférence  à  tout  autre.» 

III 

«Comme  les  empiétements  accroissants  et  alarmants  des  privilèges  de  la  classe, 
l'étude  calme  et  approfondie  des  moyens  les  plus  appropriés,  les  plus  efficaces,  pour 
diriger  la  classe  ouvrière  vers  le  même  but  nous  adoptions  les  propositions  sui 
vantes : 

Que  le  premier  et  le  grand  desideratum  de  l'heure  présente  pour  affranchir  le  tra 
vail  de  l'esclavage  dans  lequel  il  se  trouve,  est  l'adoption  d'une  loi  qui  porterait  à 
huit  heures  la journée  légale  du  travail  dans  tous  les  Etats  de  l'Union  américaine,  et 
pour  cela  il faut  que  la  classe  ouvrière  se  décide  à  ne jamais  discontinuer  ses  efforts 
jusqu'à  ce  que  ce  glorieux  résultat  soit  obtenu: 

Que  c'est  un  devoir  impératif  pour  tout  ouvrier  des  Etats-Unis  de  s'incorporer 
dans  les  ligues  du  travail,  là  où  il  en  existe  et  dans  les  endroits  où  il  n'en  existerait 
pas  de  commencer  immédiatement  à  en  former  sur  la  même  base;  il  est  également: 
du  devoir  de  chaque  ligue  de  se  faire  représenter  dans  les  Trades'  Unions  (associa 
tions  de  métiers)  et  d'apporter  son  concours  pour  la  formation  d'une  organisation 
nationale  et  internationale  des  travailleurs. 

Que  dans  la  co-opération  nous  trouvons  un  remède  certain  et  durable  contre  les 
abus  du  système  industriel  actuel,  et  que  nous  appelons  de  tous  nos  vœux  la  fonda 
tion  de  magasins  et  fabriques  co-opératives  dans  ce  pays  et  conseillons  leur  forma 
tion  dans  chaque  partie  de  cette  contrée  et  dans  chaque  branche  de  l'industrie. 

Que  le  système  des maisons  pénitentiaires,  tel qu'il est pratiqué  dans  ce  pays,  est 
non-seulement  offensant  pour les  classes  productrices,  mais  est  une  invitation  pour 
les  patrons  rapaces  d'obtenir  par  l'entremise  du  gouvernement  une  diminution  de 
prix sur le  travail,  en  conséquence nous  recommandons  aux  ouvriers  de ne  patroner 
que  les  partis  qui  n'admettent  le  travail  des  prisonniers  que  s'il  est  rémunéré  de  la 
même  façon  que  dans  les  fabriques  avoisinantes. 

Que  nous  accordons  notre  protection,  tant  individuelle  qu'associée,  aux  fileuses 
et  aux  femmes  industrieuses  et  sollicitons  ardemment  leur  co-opération,  car  nous 
savons  qu'il n'existe  pas  de  classe  industrielle  dont  la  position nécessite plus  d'amé 
lioration  que  celles  des  fileuses  ou  ouvrières  de  l'industrie ; 

678 

Résolutions du  Congrès  Ouvrier Américain  de  1866 

Qu'aujourd'hui  nous  devons  tendre  la  main  aux  laboureurs  dans  l'intérêt  de 
l'agriculture,  c'est  pourquoi  nous  déclarons :  Io  que  nos  différentes  ligues  devront 
adopter  la  même  résolution:  <Que  toute  l'étendue  du  territoire  américain  soit  pos 
sédé  seulement  par  les  cultivateurs;  2°  Que  des  membres  particuliers  de  cette 
convention soient nommés  à l'effet de  surveiller l'exécution  de  cette  résolution ;> 

Que  ce  congrès  condamne  ce  que  communément  l'on  nomme  grèves,  et  recom 
mande  aux  ouvriers  de  n'y  recourir  que  lorsqu'ils  n'auront  le  moyen  de  faire  autre 
ment; 

Que  l'institution  d'écoles  technologiques  et  polytechniques,  de  bibliothèques  et 
la  construction  d'édifices  à  cette  intention  est  recommandée  aux  ouvriers  de  tous 
les pays  et  de  toutes  les  villes  comme  un moyen  d'activer leur culture  intellectuelle 
et  leur  progrès  social.»

Verification of powers. 
The  Geneva branch having  been  commissioned  by  the  Central  Council to  make  the 
necessary  preparations  for  the  holding  of the  Congress,  proceeded  to  verify  the  cre 
dentials  of the  delegates. 

The  credential  tally  gave  the  following  result: 
Delegates  of branches,  45;  delegates  of affiliated  societies,  15;  total,  60. 

Right  of  admission. 

10  A  warm  discussion  arose  on  the  demand  of some  individuals  who,  though  unpro 
vided  with  credentials,  considered  that  they  had  a  right  to  be  admitted  as  delegates 
of the  Paris  sections,  and  to  take  part  in  the  proceedings  of the  Congress.  They  al 
leged  the  state  of  the  law  in  France,  where  meetings  were  not  allowed.  Several 
members  supported  their  demand.  In  their  opinion,  the  organisation  of  the  Con-
15  gress  was  neither  complete  nor  definitive;  therefore  one  ought  not  to  be  too  exclu 
sive  or  exacting;  that  on  the  contrary  it  would  be  better to  admit  to  the  proceedings 
of the  Congress  every  well-meaning  individual. 

The  British  delegates  insisted  on the  contrary  that they  had  come  to the  Congress 
as  representatives  of branches  and  societies,  reckoning  several  thousands  of mem-
20  bers,  and  that,  as  such,  they  were  of  the  opinion  that  the  representative  system 
should  form  the  basis  of  the  Congress,  and  that  were  individuals,  representing  no 
organised  body,  to  be  admitted,  they  would  violate  the  rule  of  equality  by  voting, 
and that the rights of themselves  (the  representative  Britons)  would  thereby  be  dam 
nified. 

25 

The meeting  decided  that the  right  of taking part in the  debates  and  decisions be 

longed  exclusively  to  the  delegates  who  had  regular  credentials. 

Election  of Chairman  and  officers. 
The  delegates,  after this  interruption,  set  to  work  at  the  election  of a  Chairman,  and 
citizen  Jung,  a  delegate  of the  Central  Council,  was  elected  to  preside  over  the  dis-

30  eussions  of the  Congress  by  a  majority  of 45  votes. 

Citizen  Dupleix,  of the  French  branch  of Geneva,  and  citizen  Becker,  of the  Ger 

man  section  of the  same  city,  were  appointed  vice-presidents. 

Citizens  Coullery,  of Chaux-de-Fonds,  Card,  of Geneva,  Bourdon,  of Paris,  Moll, 

of  Cologne,  were  appointed  Secretaries.

Rules  of  meeting. 
It was resolved that there  should  be  two  sittings  daily,  the  first  at 9 a.m.  and  the  sec 
ond  at  2 p.m. 

Citizen  Cremer  (London)  proposed  that  every  member  who  brought  forward  a 
motion  should  have  15  minutes,  and  no  more,  for his  opening  speech,  and  only  one 
speech  in  reply,  not  to  occupy  more  than  ten  minutes,  and  that  the  members  who 
should  speak  upon  the  question  should  only  speak  for  ten  minutes  each  at  the 
most. 

This  proposition  was  resolved  in  the  affirmative  unanimously. 

Sitting  of  September  4,  1866. 
(9  a.m.) 
Citizen  Jung  in  the  Chair. 

Reading  Reports. 
Citizen  Fribourg,  in  the  name  of  the  Paris  section,  read  the  report  and  balance 
sheet  of the  receipts  and  expenses  of the  Association  in  that  city.  This  report  also 
made  known  the  moral  result  which  had  been  obtained  in  France. 

Citizen  Cremer  read  the  executive  Report  of  the  London  Central  Council.  This 
report  states  that  25,173  citizens  were  members  of the  Association.  The  report  ex 
pressed  hope  that  more  than  20,000  new  members  would  soon  adhere  to  the  same. 
The  moral  effect  of  the  International  Association  had  been  very  great  throughout 
Britain. 

Citizen  Coullery,  in  the  name  of the  meeting,  thanked  the  working  men  of Brit 

ain  for  what  they  had  done. 

Citizen Fribourg,  in the  name  of the  French  delegates,  expressed  gratitude to the 
Central  Council,  and  moved  that  the  debt  due  by  the  said  Council be  considered  as 
international. 

Reading  of Essays. 
At  the  request  of  many  members,  Citizen  Dupont  read  a  translation  of  the  essay 
drawn  up  by  the  Central  Council  of London,—an  essay  which  discusses  almost  all 
the  questions  propounded  by  the  programme  of the  International  Association. 

Citizen  Chemalé,  of Paris,  then read,  in the  name  of the Paris  branches,  the  Paris 

ian  essay,  which  dealt  with  all  the  questions  set  down  upon  the  programme. 

This  reading  was  interrupted  by  the  hour  of closing.

Reading  of Essays. 
Citizen  Chemalé  (Paris)  concluded  the  reading  of the  report of the  Parisian  branch. 
Citizen  Tolain  (Paris) proposed that  all the  reports be  read  in  the  three languages 

5 

and  that  then  the  general  discussion  on  these  reports  should  commence. 

This  motion  was  adopted  by  a  large  majority. 
Citizen  Eccarius  (London)  read  in  German  the  report  of the  Central  Council  of 

London.

On  the  question  of Popular  Education,  there  was  presented  a  report  drawn up  by 

the  minority  and  one  by  the  majority  of the  Paris  section. 

The  Lyons  delegation,  after  the  reading  of the  Parisian  essay,  said  that  they  ab 
stained  from reading their report  and  that  they  entirely  adhered  to  the  said  essay,  in 
as  much  as  it  contained  their ideas  and  principles.  On  the  question  of popular  edu-
cation,  they  pronounced  in  favour  of Home  Education.

Essays  of  individual  members. 
Citizen  Fribourg  having  laid  on  the  table  an  essay  which  he  had just  received  from 
two  members  of the  Association  at  Paris,  the  question  arose  as  to  what  should  be 
done  with  this  and many  other essays  contributed  by  individual  members  of the As-
sociation( , ). 

It  was  unanimously  resolved,  on  the  motion  of citizen  Cremer,  that  the  Geneva 
committee  of management  should  take  these  essays  in  charge  and make  a  summary 
report  thereupon  to  the  Congress®. 

Organkation  Committee. 
Citizen  Card  (Geneva)  proposed  the  appointment  of a  committee  to  draw up  the  de 
finitive  rules  for  the  government  of the  Association. 

Adopted  unanimously. 
Citizen  Card  proposed  that  every  nationality  be  represented  by  a  number  of 

members  in  proportion  to  the  number  of the  delegates. 

Card's  proposition  is  adopted. 
The  following  Committee  was  appointed: 
Germans,  4:  Bürkli,  Hoppenworth,  Becker,  Schlaifer.  British,  3:  Eccarius,  Carter, 
Dupont.  French,  5:  Varlin,  Fribourg,  Schettel,  Tolain,  Aubry.  Swiss,  2:  Dupleix, 
Coullery.

Sitting  of  September  5,  1866. 

Morning 

Sitting. 

Citizen  Jung  in  the  Chair. 

Citizen  Card  (Geneva)( I)  proposed  the  discussion  of the  programme,  article  by  arti 
cle.  He  demanded  that  for  every  question  a  resolution  be  drawn  up  which  should 
serve  as  the  basis  of the  public  discussion. 

5 

Card's  proposition  was  supported  by  all  the  members  present. 
The  second  question was  about to  be  formulated  according  to  the  above  proposal, 
when  citizen  Cremer  (London)  pointed  out  that  the  meeting  could  not  discuss  the 
resolution  profitably  except  in  the  presence  of all the  delegates,  for  it might happen  10 
that  the  members  of  the  Committee  would  reject  one  or  more  of  the  resolutions 
come  to  by  the  meeting.  He  also  pointed  out  that  the  various  programmes  were  not 
alike.  The  order of the  questions varied  in  each,  and  some heads  of the  French  pro 
gramme  did  not  appear  in  the  London  and  Genevese  programmes. 

Afternoon  Sitting. 
Citizen  Card  read  a  letter  from  Milan  addressed  by  citizen  Stampa  of that  city  to 
the  members  of the  Congress.  In  behalf of the  Italian  working  classes  the  writer  ex 
pressed  his  regret  that  none  of their  delegates  could  take  part  in  this  remarkable  In 
ternational  Congress  of the  working  classes.  Those  in  whose  behalf he  wrote  hoped 
that  their  adhesion  would  be  deemed  equivalent  to  their  presence. 

15 

20 

This  letter produced  a great  impression  on the  meeting,  and was greeted  by unan 
imous  applause.  Several  members  demanded  that  it  be  translated  into  German  and 
English  and  inserted  in  the  minutes  of the  Congress. 

The  letter was  accordingly  translated  and  the  motion  for its  insertion was  carried. 
The Chairman  announced that the London journals the  Times  and the  Daily News  25 

had  both  inserted  articles  on  the  Congress.  He  added  that  this  fact  was  a  cheering 
one,  in  as  much  as  these journals  were  two  of the  most  consideration  in  England. 
They  had  hitherto  not  deigned  to  mention  the  Association. 

The  Rules  of  the  Association. 
Citizen  Coullery  (Switzerland)  was  then  called upon  in the  name  of the  Committee  30 
appointed  to  draw  up  the  rules  or  constitution  of the Association,  to  read  the  report 
of this  Committee. 

Several  members  asked  that  the  Rules  be  read  through  to  the  end,  and  that  they 

then  be  taken  up  one  by  one. 

This  mode  of proceeding  was  approved  of and  adopted. 
Concerning  article  1,  having  reference  to  the  appointment  of  the  general  secre 
tary,  the  delegates  were  divided  in  opinion.  The  London  delegates  proposed that he 
be  appointed  by  the  Congress  in  order  to  render  his  responsibility  greater.

Sittings  of  September  5,  1866 

Citizen  Tolain  and  others  argued,  on  the  other  hand,  that  the  General  Secretary 
should  be  appointed  by  the  General  Council.  They  argued  that  a  difference  might 
arise  between  these  two  authorities  if they both  held  office  on  the  same  tenure.  The 
difference  and  conflict  might  last  from  the  dissolution  of one  Congress  to  the  reas-
sembling  of another  and  might  check  the  march  of the  Association. 

5 

The  latter  opinion  obtained  the  sanction  of the  majority  of  the  members. 
On  article  2,  which  concerned  the  fixing  of the  date  of the  Congress,  citizen  Card 
said  that  he  thought  that  the  selection  of the  time  and place  for  the  Congress  should 
be  left  to  the  initiative  of the  General  Council. 

10 

This  proposition was  supported  by  the  German  and London  delegates.  It was  op 

posed  by  many  members  of the  French  and  Swiss  delegates. 

Citizen  Murat  made  the  following  motion: 
That the fixing  of the  time  of the  reassembling  of the  Congress  be  irrevocably  set 
tled  every  year  by  the  Congress  itself,  and  that  the  power  of choosing  the  place  be 
left  to  the  General  Council. 

15 

20 

The  members  who  supported  this  motion  demanded  that  the  delegations  of the 
different  countries  irrespective  of the  decision  of the  General  Council,  should  have 
the  right  of assembling  without  any  convoking  of a  Congress. 

Murat's  motion  was  accepted  by  the  majority. 
Citizen  Tolain  spoke  to  a  question  of order.  He  proposed  that  in  the  disposal  of 
amendments  made  to  the  different  motions,  the  procedure  of  the  French  Legisla 
ture  be  adopted.  This  procedure  was  to  draw  up  written  amendments  and  to  lay 
them  on  the  table.  The  President  then  brings  them  forward  for  discussion,  begin 
ning  with  the  one  which  is  most  at  variance  with  the  original  motion. 

25 

This  proposition  was  adopted  by  the  majority,  although  opposed  by  the  London 

delegates. 

The  discussion  of the  articles  continued. 
A propos  of annual  Congress,  citizens  Cremer  and  Odger  (London)  urged  that  it 
was  inexpedient  to  hold  Congress  so  often  as  once  a  year;  their  principal  reason  in 
favour of their  conclusion  was  the  travelling  and  other  expenses  of the  delegates. 

30 

The  majority  of the  members  thought  that  every  Congress  would  produce  a  new 
flood  of  life  to  the  Association  and  would  attract  a  larger  number  of  members, 
which  would  correspondingly  increase  their  funds. 

35 

The  meeting  decided  that  the  Congress  should  be  held  annually. 
Articles  4,  5  and  6  were  unanimously  adopted. 
On  article  7,  which  relates  to  advances  to  be  made  to  members  who  pass  from 
one  country  into  another,  the  delegates  emit  contrary  opinions.  Some  argue  that 
the  power  ought  not  to  be  granted  to  the  branches  to  grant  to  all  the  members  a 
credit  by  which  those  branches  might  be  victimised.  They  said  that  the  working 
40  man  must  break  himself in to  economy  and  not  reckon  on  any  pecuniary  aid.  They 
add  that  the  International  Association  ought  only  to  try  and  find  employment  for 
the  emigrating  working  man  and  grant  him  only  what  in  some  countries  is  called  a 
viaticum. 

Citizens  Tolain  and  Fribourg  (Paris)  replied  that  it  was  easy  to  meet  these  diffi-
45  culties,  and proposed the following means  of doing  so.  His  branch will be guarantee 

689 

International  Association  of Working  Men.  Report of the  Congress  of  Geneva  (1866) 

for  the  monies  advanced  to  the  emigrating  member.  And  in  case  the  hospitable 
branch  shall  have  no  funds  in  hand,  let  it  draw  at  sight  on  the  home  branch  the 
amount  advanced.  In  this  way,  there  would  be  neither  charity  nor  hospitality.  The 
migrating  citizen  would  simply  exercise  his  right.  The  home  branch  is  the  sole 
judge  of the  way  in  which  it  will  accredit  its  migrating  member. 

5 

The  London  delegation  demanded  the  adjournment  of  this  question.  This  ad 
journment  was  voted  down.  The  original  proposition  was  carried  with  two  dissen 
tients. 

On  article  8,  which  related to  the  conditions  necessary  for  admission to  the  Inter 

national  Association  of Working  Men,  a  very  animated  discussion  took  place. 

1C 

A  part  of  the  meeting  desired  that  every  man,  hand-worker  or  otherwise,  who 
contributes  to  the  emancipation  of the  working  class,  be  admissible  to  the  Associa 
tion. 

The  Parisian  and  several  Swiss  delegates  demanded,  on  the  contrary,  that  the 
condition  of hand-worker be  dispensed  with.  Their  reason  was  that  many  self-seek-  15 
ing  men  would  worm  themselves  into  the  Association  in  order  to  make  themselves 
masters  of it  and  to  make  it  serve  their personal  ends.  In this way,  they would  divert 
the  Association  from  its  true  aim. 

After  a  long  discussion,  the  meeting  pronounced  in  favour  of thefollowing  pro 

position,  which was  presented  by  the  members  of the  Organising  Committee. 

20 

"Every  one  who  can  make  good  his  title  to  working-man-hood  shall  be  admissi 
ble  as  a  member  of the  Association;  so  as  that  every  branch  shall  have  the  right  of 
admitting  whomsoever  it  pleased  on  its  own  responsibility." 

Articles  9,  10,  11,  were voted  unanimously.

First  Article  of  the  P r o g r a m m e. 
Organisation  of  the  Association. 

Citizens  Dupont  and  Carter,  both  of London,  proposed  that  a  committee  of five be  30 
appointed  to  draw  up  the  rules  of the  Association. 

Motion  accepted. 
The  members  appointed  were  Eccarius,  Fribourg,  Bürkli,  Coullery  and  Schettel. 

Publication  of Essays  and  Programmes. 

Citizen  Tolain  (Paris)  asked  if the  Essays  and  mémoires  presented  to  the  Congress  35 
are  to  be  published  at  the  expense  of the  General  Council. 

Citizen  Card  (Switzerland)  proposed  that  a  Committee  be  appointed  to  decide  as 

690 

Sittings  of September 6,  1866 

to  what  should  be  published  at  the  general  expense  and  what  not,  leaving  to  the 
several  sections  the  right  to  publish  their  contributions  in  case  of their  non-inser 
tion  in  the  official  report  of the  Congress. 

Citizen  Becker  opposed  the  appointment  of this  Committee  and  maintained  that 
this  work  of  selection  which  would  require  from  ten  days  to  a  fortnight  to  accom 
plish  must  be  entrusted  to  the  General  Council  of London. 
The  proposition  of Becker's  was  voted  unanimously. 
Citizen  Tolain  (Paris)  proposed  that  the  three  Programmes  of the  London,  Ger 
man  and  French  delegations  be  published  in  extenso  in  the  official  Report  of  the 
Transactions  of the  Congress. 

Voted  unanimously. 
Dupont  proposed  that  all  the  contributions  published  by  the  several  sections  be 

sent to the  General Council  in order that they may be  there preserved  among the ar

Citizen  Dupont  called  the  attention  of the  Association  to  a  circumstance  which  had 
passed  at  Ferney  and  which  it  was  important  to  make  known  to  all  the  delegates. 
The  band  of Ferney,  which  was  composed  of working  men,  had  manifested  the  in 
tention  of taking  part  in  the  Congress  by  offering  its  gratuitous  services  for the  Sun 
day  festival.  A  Prefectoral  order  had  prohibited  them  from  doing  so.  The  Prefect 
had  at  the  same  time  withdrawn  from  the  band-master  the  stipend which was  allot 
ted  to  him. 

Citizen  Dupleix,  of Geneva,  corroborated  the  facts  advanced  by  Citizen  Dupont. 
Citizen  Fribourg,  of Paris,  proposed  the  following  resolution: 
"This  Congress  is  astonished  at  the  stretch  of authority  of which  the  band-master 
at  Ferney  has  been  the  victim  and  instructs  its  President  to  convey  to  him  its  regret 
and  its  sympathy." 

The  resolution  was  passed.

International  Association  of  Working  Men.  Report of the  Congress  of  Geneva  (1866) 

The  Parisian  malcontents. 
Citizen  Dupont  (London)  points  out  that  a  group  of Parisian  members  having  come 
to  Geneva  without  credentials  with  a  view  to  take  part  in  the  proceedings  of  the 
Congress,  it would be  expedient  that the  meeting  should  vote  the  immediate  admis 
sion  of a  member  of this  group  to  make  known  the  subject  matter  which  the  group 
wanted  to  have  discussed,  and  adds  that  this  group  accused  the  Parisian  delegates 
of wishing  to  stifle  discussion. 

Citizen  Fribourg,  in  the  name  of the  Parisian  delegation,  gave  a  formal  denial to 
this  accusation  and  said  that  the  Parisian  delegates  have  always  contended  for  and 
do  still  contend  for  the  admission  of the  malcontent  group. 

Several  German  and  British  members  said  that  they  did  not understand  why  this 

question  was  exhumed  and  demanded  the  order  of the  day. 

A  "row"  having  been  raised  in  the  hall,  Citizen  Dupleix  said  that  the  Congress 
was  placed  under  the  auspices  of the  Genevese  Committee  and  he  accordingly  in 
vited  the  members  thereof  to  re-establish  order. 

The  order  of the  day  was  voted  by  a  majority;  17  votes  being  thrown  against  it. 

Second  Article  of  the  P r o g r a m m e. 
C o m b i n a t i on  of  efforts  by  m e a ns 
of  the  Association  in  the  different  n a t i o n al  struggles 
between  capital  a nd  labour. 

Citizen  Dupont read  the  Commentary  on  this  article  made  by  the  General  Council 
and  added  these  words: 

"I  request  the  particular  attention  of the  Congress  to  the  statistics  proposed  by 
the  General  Council.  It  is  one  of  the  most  important  questions  that  we  have  to 
solve;  for  it  alone  will  furnish  to  us  positive  data  on  the  relative  position  of  the 
working  classes  of every  country;  then  only  shall  we  be  able  to  act  with  the  advan 
tage  of that  complete  knowledge  which  familiarity  with  the  elements  of the  social 
struggle  will  give  us." 

Citizen  Lawrence  (London)  proceeded  to  detail  what  combinations  ought  to  be 
employed  to  develop  this  struggle  and  give  it  a  constantly  increasing  intensity.  He 
wished  to  see  such  ties  formed  between  the  working  classes  of  every  country  that 
they  may  attain  to  a  mutual  knowledge  of  their  respective  situations;  in  this  way 
they  would  be  able  to  baffle  the  schemes  of the  employers.  In  proof  of  his  allega 
tions,  he  cited  the  last  strike  of the  tailors  of London  and  Scotland.  The  employers, 
in  order  to  escape  from  the just  demands  of their  workmen,  brought  over  into  Brit 
ain  some  German  operative  tailors,  who,  on  arrival,  found  themselves  without  work 
and  surrounded  by  a population whose  language  they  did  not understand.  The  con 
sequence  was  that  they were  exploités  by  the  employers  and made  to  work  at  a lower 
price  than  that  paid  to  the  British  operative.  The  Trade  Society  of the  London  tai 
lors  and  the  General  Council  of the  Association  did  what  they  could  for  these  poor 
men.  They  helped  them  to  return  to  their  country  or  to  obtain  the  full  wages  for 

692 

Sittings  of  September 6,  1866

their  work  in  Britain.  Something  similar  to  this  had  just  taken  place  in  the  case  of 
the  excavators  of the  South  of England.  Since  the  capitalists,  thanks  to  the  means 
furnished  them  by  industry,  have  so  many  ways  of putting  "the  screw"  upon  work 
ing  men,  the  latter  have  but  one  way  of shaking  off the  yoke,  and  that  is  an  under-
standing  between  working  men  of every  country  to  declare  war  to  the  knife  against 
the race  of capitalists.  With  a view to  prepare  for this  war,  every  section  of the  Inter 
national  Association  ought  to  be  an  Information  Office  where  every  working  man 
may  be  able  to  obtain  trustworthy  intelligence  concerning  the  condition  of  the 
working  classes  and  of  the  particular  trade  to  which  he  belongs  in  the  country  to 

10  which he  desires  to  emigrate. 

For  the  above  reasons,  Lawrence  proposed  the  following  resolution: 
"That  the  different  sections  enter  into  communication  with  the  Trade  Societies 
(or  individual  working  men  where  no  Trade  Society  exists)  with  a  view  to  obtain  a 
report  upon  the  economical  and  political  condition  of  the  working  classes  of  the 
country.  Such  report  to  be  communicated  to  the  other  sections." 

Citizen  Murat  (Paris)  seconded  the  resolution  of Citizen  Lawrence. 
Citizen  Coullery  insisted  upon  this,  that  the  capitals  saved  and  amassed  by  the 

working  men  ought not to  return  to  the  hands  of the  capitalists,  but  ought to be  em 
ployed  in the  establishment of cooperative  associations,  which will  enrich  the  work-
ing  classes  and  augment  their power  in  the  struggle  against  the  class  of exploiters; 
and  he  concludes  by  this  mot:  "Capitalist  exploitation  is  legalised  robbery." 

15

Citizen  Dupont  said  that  the  resolution  of Lawrence  was  unnecessary  inasmuch 
as  the  General  Council  had  foreseen  the  proposition  by  proposing  a  scheme  of sta 
tistics,  which  would  furnish  every  kind  of  detail  concerning  the  position  of  the 
25  working man.  This  scheme,  he  added,  is  imperiously  called  for,  the  position  of the 
working  man  in  presence  of the  employers  is  precarious  in  the  extreme.  Judge  by 
the  following  fact:  A  workman  had  been  hired  at  Sheffield  by  an  employer  for  the 
term  of two  years.  A  strike  takes  place,  the  workmen  obtain  an  increase  of wages. 
The  working  man  under  contract  wishes  to  participate  in  the  benefit  of the  increase. 
30  The  employer  refuses  to  pay  him  the  advance;  the  workman  thereupon  ceases  to 
work.  The  employer  takes  out  a  summons,  and  the  workman  is  condemned  to  three 
months  imprisonment.  On  coming  out  of prison,  the  employer claims  the  benefit of 
the  contract;  the  workman  again  refuses  to  work;  the  magistrate  threatens  him  with 
successive  three  monthly  terms  of  imprisonment,  until  the  term  of service  has  ex-
35  pired,  if he  do  not immediately return  to  the  workshop,  at the  wages  agreed  on  pre 
vious  to  the  general  advance.  You  see  everything  is  turned  against  the  workman, 
who,  in  presence  of the  capitalist,  is  without  means  of defence.  It  is  necessary  that, 
by  means  of  these  statistics,  he  may  at  least  have  an  opportunity  of  knowing  the 
ground  on  which  he  stands. 

40 

Citizen  Tolain  said  that  in  Britain,  thanks  to  the  genius  of British  liberty,  the 
class  movement  manifested  itself  by  a  policy  of  resistance,  whereas  in  France  by 
reason  of  the  shackles  imposed  upon  the  organisation  of  the  working  classes,  a 
strike  has  only  been  a  rare  and  extreme  measure  and  cooperation  has  been  there 
deemed  to  be  the  only  means  of working  class  emancipation. 

45 

Citizen  Odger  (London):  "In  our  British  strikes,  the  employers  compel  their 

693 

International  Association  of Working  Men.  Report of the  Congress  of Geneva  (1866) 

working  men  to  give  way  by  the  importation  of continental  working  men  or  by  the 
mere  threat  of importing  them.  The  International  Association  must  put  an  end  to 
this  state  of things.  And  as  the  primary  cause  of these  importations  is  the  compara 
tively  low  scale  of wages  on  the  Continent,  the  working  men  of Britain  will  support 
the  claims  of the  Continental  working  men  and  in  case  of need,  will  make  pecuni 
ary  sacrifices  to  sustain  them  in  their  warfare." 

Citizen  Eccarius  (London).  Strikes  should  no  longer  be  confined  to  a  single  na 
tion;  the  capitalist  centralisation has  become  so  strong that  the  employers  baffle the 
national  strikers  either  by  importations  of foreign  workmen  or  by  giving  orders  to 
be  executed  in  other  countries.  This  is  what  occurred  in  the  recent  strike  in  the 
Sheffield  file  trades.  The  Sheffield  employers  sent  orders  to  the  United  States  in  or 
der  to  paralyse  the  movement  of their  operatives;  but  the  American  file-smiths  re 
fused  to  lend  themselves  to  these  stratagems.  However  such  a  fact  is  extraordinary; 
as  a  rule,  the  employers  are  able  to  avail  themselves  of this  weapon  and  triumph by 
means  of it.  Therefore  in  order  to  render  a  strike  profitable  at  the  present juncture 
of  the  World's  history,  it  is  expedient  that  at  the  same  moment  the  workmen  of 
every  country  should  refuse  to  work,  that the  strike  be  universal,  worldwide!  To  de 
mand  a  Universal  strike  is  to  demand  the  Revolution. 

Citizen  Cremer  (London)  perceived  the  necessity  of these  statistics  and  adduced 
in  proof thereof what  took  place  in  England  in  1859  at  the  time  of the  famous  strike 
of the  Building-Trades.  This  gigantic  strike  was  made  by  several  thousands  of work 
ing  men,  thousands  of  pounds  sterling  were  spent  in  sustaining  it,  all  the  English 
Trade  Unions  contributed  to  the  funds  spent  in  maintaining  this  strike.  The  em 
ployers  threatened  to  import  foreign  workmen  in  mass.  The  English  workmen  im 
mediately  wrote  to  all  the  foreign  working  men's  associations,  but,  as  they  had  not 
the  relations  which  the  International  Association  possesses,  the  workmen  were 
forced  to  give  in  after  a  38  weeks'  cessation  from work.  This  fact  makes  it  plain  that 
to  guarantee  success  to  the  working  class  in  the  battle  which  they  have  to  wage 
against  capital,  it  is  necessary  that  immense  means  of  publicity  be  placed  in  the 
hands  of  the  working  classes.  And  to  avert  the  importation  of  working  men  from 
one  country  to  another,  we  must  try  and  establish  a  nearly  uniform  rate  of wages 
and  one  can  only  do  that by  aiding  every  movement  for  the  augmentation  of wages 
and  the  diminution  of  the  hours  of labour. 

Citizen  Becker  (Germany)  makes  the  following  proposition: 
"That  the  working  men's  Societies  in  all  parts  of  the  world  be  invited  to  enter 
into  communication  with  each  other  through  the  medium  of the  General  Council, 
that  they  give  mutual  information  concerning  the  amount  of wages,  the  hours  of la 
bour,  the  mode  of hiring  labour,  etc.  That  in this way  it will  be  possible  to  arrive  at 
the  desideratum  of a  uniform  rate  of wages  in  all  countries.  As  the  wages  question 
is  not  national  but  international,  we  invite  working  men  of  every  country  to  aid 
each  other  as  much  as  possible  (through  the  medium  of  the  General  Council)  in 
their  daily  struggles  with  Capital;  and  that  by  these  means  they  would  hinder  the 
employers  from  obtaining  foreign  workmen  during  a  class-battle  of the  native  work 
ing  men." 

Resolution  adopted.  Eight  votes  against  it. 

694 

Sittings  of  September  6,  1866 

Citizen  Cornaz  (Switzerland)  proposed  the  establishment  of  information  offices 
in  every  town  where  the  working  men  might  apply  for  work  and  where  the  employ 
ers  might  apply  for  workmen. 

Citizen  Card  (Switzerland),  condemns  strikes  on  principle.  He  said  it  was  a bar 
barous method  and  one that  strengthened  the wage  system,  which  they  all wished  to 
abolish.  We  ought  to  preach  the  benefits  of cooperation,  for  it  organises  the  work 
ing  classes,  guarantees  to  them  the  enjoyment  of the  fruits  of their  labour,  and  de 
velops  their  intelligence. 

Citizen  Jung  left  the  Presidential  chair  to  defend  strikes,  at  least  under  the  eco 
nomic  conditions  of England.  British  strikes  were  acts  of defence  against  the  infa 
mous  exactions  of the  employer  class.  Generally,  it  was  the  employers  who  closed 
their workshops  and  locked  out  their workmen,  as was the  case with the  London  tai 
lors  and  the  file  operatives  of Sheffield.  Although  the  strike  was  often  dearly  paid 
for,  it  brought  back  more  on  the  balance  to  the  well  organised  trades  than  it  cost, 
whether  it  was  entered  upon  for  the  sake  of  diminishing  the  hours  of the  working 
day  or  for  an  increase  of wages. 

Citizen  Card  and  citizen  Camélinat  of Paris  protest  against  strikes  and  do  not  be 

lieve  in  the  benefits  said  to  be  derived  from  them  by  the  British  workman. 

Dupont  (London)  argued  that  the  British  do  not  endorse  strikes  on  principle,  but 
only  as  a  weapon  of war.  It  is  by  means  of this  weapon  alone  that  the  British  work 
ing  class  have  been  organised,  and  no  other European  country  offers  such  an  exam 
ple  of compact  organisation.  Cooperation  reduced  to  the  insignificant  resources  of 
which  it  can  dispose  would  have  been  powerless  to  attain  this  result.  For  this  rea 
son,  even  if strikes  be  condemned  on  principle,  they  ought  to  be  sanctioned  as  the 
only  weapon  which  the  working  class  have  at  their  disposal.  And,  recurring  to  the 
statistical  project,  he  submits  for  the  approval  of the  meeting 

the  Plan  of Statistics 

proposed  by  the  General  Council,  which  was  unanimously  adopted. 

Card,  of Switzerland,  and  Tolain,  of Paris,  propose  the  following  resolution: 
"This  Congress  declares  that,  in  the  present  condition  of  industry,  which  is  a 
state  of war,  the  working  classes  ought to  proffer to  each  other aid  for  the  defense  of 
the  scale  of wages.  But  it  also  believes  it  to  be  its  duty  to  declare  that  there  is  a 
more  elevated  aim  to  be  sought  after,  which  aim  is  the  suppression  of  the  wages' 
system,  and  it  recommends  a  search  after  economical  systems  based  on justice  and 
reciprocity." 

Resolution  adopted.

T r a d e s'  U n i o n s.  Their  past,  p r e s e nt  a nd  future. 

Citizen  Fribourg  (Paris),  in  the  name  of the  Parisian  delegation,  moved  the  follow 
ing  proposition: 

"The  past  was  the  guild,  that  is  despotism;  the  present  is  each  man  for  himself, 
that  is  mutual  antagonism  and  universal  subjection  to  capital;  the  future  is  the 
identification  of the  consumer,  the producer  and  the  capitalist  brought  about  by  co 
operation." 

This  resolution  was  unanimously  adopted  as  was  also  the  extract  from  the  Lon

Co-operative  labour. 

Citizen  Eccarius  (London)  read  the  commentary  of the  General  Council,  which was 
unanimously  adopted. 

Citizens  Fribourg  and  Chemalé  (Paris)  made  the  following  addendum  thereto: 
"The  Congress  recommends  co-operative  associations  to  avoid  the form  of a  one-
man  executive  and  to  leave  to the  associates  the  plenary right of management  on  all 
points  conformably  to  the  articles  of agreement  signed  by  them." 

Citizen  Bocquin  (Montreux)  proposed  to  congratulate  the  Lausanne  section, 
which,  during  the  last winter,  had  undertaken  at  its  risk public  works  for  the  sake  of 
employing  the  working  class. 

Citizen  Cremer  (London)  quoted  an  analogous  fact.  The  excavators  of  London

Article  VII. 
Direct  a nd  indirect  taxation. 

The  Commentary  of the  General  Council  on  this  question  was  read. 

After  a  short  discussion,  the  Parisian  delegates  submitted  the  following  resolu 

tion  to  the  Congress: 

"Taxes are  the  quota paid by the  individual  citizen towards  the general expenses; 
it  is  therefore  an  exchange  between  the  citizen  and  society  represented  by  the  gov 
ernment.  The  citizens  being  the  sole  judges  of  the  services  it  requires  and  of  the 
remuneration  to  be  paid,  therefore  they  are  alone  entitled  to  vote  and  levy  the  tax. 
The  tax  ought  to  be  as  direct  as  possible  so  as  that  the  quota  of each  be  clearly 

defined  and  its  just  incidence  be  easily  controlled." 

Citizen  Coullery  (Chaux-de-Fonds)  proposed  an  amendment  to  this  resolution, 
substituting  for  the  words  "as  direct  as  possible"  the  word  "direct"  without  more, 
which  was  on  all  fours  with  the  London  Commentary. 

But  after  a  short  discussion,  he  withdrew  his  amendment  and  the  resolution  was 

accepted  by  the  meeting. 

Article  VIII. 
I n t e r n a t i o n al  Credit. 

Citizen  Fribourg  (Paris)  brought  forward  the  following  series  of resolutions. 

"1.  The  Congress  refers  the  subject  of  international  credit  to  the  study  of  the 
members  of the  Association  and  invites  all  the  sections  of the  Association  to  send 
the  result  of their  reflections  on  this  question  to  the  General  Council  which  will  in 
sert  it  in  its  Bulletin  in  order that  the  question  may  be  brought  to  the  cognisance  of 
all  and  be  ready  for  solution  by  the  next  Congress. 

2.  The  Congress  refers  in  the  same  manner the  idea  of a  federation  of all working 
class  banks  now  formed  or  hereafter  to  be  formed  by  means  of a  central  establish 
ment  under  the  management  of the  International  Association  of Working  Men." 

These  resolutions  were  seconded  by  citizen  Coullery  and  unanimously  adopted. 

Article  III.

Citizen  Dupont  read  the  recommendations  of the  General  Council  hereanent. 

The  French  delegates  enunciated  the  following  propositions: 
"1.  That  man  only  can  be  free  who  has  the  opportunity  of developing  all  his  fac 
ulties.  Consequently  all  prolongation  of  toil  which  would  render  a  man  incapable 
of  developing  and  enjoying  all  his  capacities  should  be  condemned  as  hostile  to 
health  and  antisocial. 

2.  Under  present  circumstances,  we  deem  ten  hours  per  diem  labour  as  what 

ought  to  suffice  to  produce  or  procure  the  necessities  of life.

tion  of the  equal  value  of employments  by  establishing  a minimum  of wages  in  pay

Afternoon 

Sitting. 

Citizen  Jung  in  the  Chair. 

Article  III.  (Continued.) 

Citizen  Odger  (London)  spoke  as  follows.  Regarding  the  fixing  of the  minimum  of 
wages,  he  thought  it  difficult  to  carry  out.  But  he  was  decidedly  of opinion  that the 
8  hours  of work,  as  proposed  by  the  General  Council,  should  be  supported  by  the 
Congress.  Eight  hours  work  are  more  than  enough  to  pay  the  expenses  of the  work 
ing  man.  They  are  enough  to  enable  him to  furnish  a  due  share  to  the  sum  of social 
products.  Do  not  forget  that  Robert  Owen,  the  famous  communist,  demonstrated 
with  the  greatest  exactness  that  three  hours work  per  day,  if given  by  all  without  ex 
ception,  would  be  enough  to  produce  the  actual  amount  of social  riches  and  reflect 
that  since  Owen's  time,  machinery  has  made  immense  progress  and  that  its  prog 
ress  has  tended  to  abridge  human  labour. 

Citizen  Cremer (London)  thought it would  be  impossible  to  establish  a minimum 
of wages.  In this  debate,  the  really  important  question  is  that of the  hours  of labour. 
It  is  the  only  one  which  we  need  resolve  in  a  positive  sense  and  we  must  energet 
ically  claim  an  eight  hours  day.  In  America,  a  great  movement  among  the  working 
class  is  on  foot  to  obtain  this  object.  The  International  Association  is  well  thought 
of by  the  American  workingmen  simply  because  of this  question,  for  they  are  con 
vinced  that  we  shall  back  them  in  this  struggle  and  set  on  foot  ourselves  an  eight 
hours'  movement.  We  cannot  abandon  them  by  demanding  less  than  they  do.  Be 
sides  the  more  extensive  our  demands  are,  the  more  we  shall  get.  Of late  the  arti 
sans  in  the  building  trades  struck  to  obtain  a  reduction  in  the  hours  of  work  to 
9  hours;  if instead  of claiming  9  hours  they  had  claimed  eight,  victory  would  have 
perched  upon  their  eagles.  Therefore  let  the  rallying  cry  of  the  working  classes  of 
the world  be  "Eight hours per  day!"  I  presume we  are  not too  presumptuous  in mak 
ing  such  a  demand. 

Citizen  Coullery  (Chaux-de-Fonds)  said  that  this  was  the  most  important  ques 
tion  which  the  Congress  had  to  pronounce  upon.  In  order  to  accomplish  the  social 
revolution  we  must  have  men,  and  the  present  manufacturing  regime  kills  the  hu 
man  being  and  reduces  him to  a  mere  wheel.  Eight hours work per  day  even  are  too 
much,  especially for women.  English capitalists  themselves were the  first  to  demand 
a  reduction  in  the  hours  of toil  for  their  "hands"  and  this  from  their  point  of view 
only,  for they  knew that  excess  of toil  diminished  the  productive  strength  of the  hu 
man  animal. 

Citizen  Card  (Poland)  said:  We  need  not  go  so  far  as  England  to  seek  our  exam 
ples,  they  are  here  in  Switzerland.  The  masters  of  the  Canton  of  Saint-Gall  have 
also  taken  the  initiative  in  this  movement  for  the  reduction  of the  hours  of labour 

698 

Sittings of September  7,  1866 

and  have  accomplished  something.  At  present,  the  legal  hours  are  fourteen  for fac 
tories  which  are  subjected  to  the  surveillance  of the  police. 

Citizen  Bürkli  (Germany)  warmly  defended  the  proposition  of the  General  Coun 
cil.  Those  who  desire  the  instruction  of the  people  ought  to vote  for the  eight hours' 
5  principle  for what  can you  expect from  a man who  works from  12  to  14  hours  a  day? 
Can  he  on  coming  home  have  the  strength  left  to  study  a  book?  Secondly,  the  con 
tinental  working  men  ought  to  stand  by  our  brethren  of England  and  America  in 
their  struggle  against  the  capitalists  and  to  demand  a  less  diminution  than  they  do, 
would  be  to  betray  them.

Citizen Murat  (Paris). The development of industry has not reached the same lev 
el  everywhere;  the  consequence  of which  is  that the  working  classes  of the  civilised 
world  are  not  in  the  same  relative  position  in  their  struggle  with  capital,  and  that 
therefore  general  rules  applying  universally  to  all  countries  cannot  be  laid  down. 
Nevertheless  in  this  Congress  we  cannot  do  better  than  accord  our  approbation  to 
the  movement  among  the  working  classes  of England  and  America,  for  those  are 
the  countries where  industry  is  most  highly  developed  and  when  France  shall  have 
achieved  a  similar  state  of  development  we  shall  be  obliged  to  make  the  same  de 
mand,  and  we  shall  be  glad  to  find  the  principle  of the  same  endorsed  by  the  first 
working  men's  Congress. 

Citizen Fribourg (Paris)  said that they,  the Parisian delegates,  do not ask for such 
a  reduction.  All  that  those  in  whose  name  he  spoke  asked  for  is  that  the  toil  of the 
workmen  be  not  such  as  to  be  unfavourable  to  the  natural  development  of their fac 
ulties  and  aptitudes,  and  they  do  not  think  it  possible  to  adopt  any  fixed  rule  on 
this  subject. 

25 

The  extract  of  the  Commentary  of the  General  Council  relating  to  the  hours  of 
labour  was  then  put  to  the  vote  and  adopted  by  the  majority.  10  votes  being  then 
thrown  in  the  negative. 

The  Parisian  delegates  then  brought  forward  the  following  resolution: 
"That  the  Association  ought  to  make  every  effort  to  affirm  the  principle  of  the 
30 equal value of occupations by establishing a minimum of wages payable for the serv 

ice  rendered  by  the  individual  to  Society." 

This  resolution  was  adopted  unanimously. 

Article  IV. 
T he  labour  of  w o m en  a nd  children. 

35  Citizen  Dupont  (London),  read  the  commentary  of the  General  Council  upon  this 

subject.  He  added: 

The  Congress  ought to  give  its  serious  attention  to  the  question  of the  apprentice. 
A  contract  exists  between  the  employer  and  the  apprentice.  The  latter  is  compelled 
to  fulfil his part  of the  bargain,  but  the  master sets  his  part  at naught,  for during  the 
term  of the  apprenticeship,  the  apprentice  is  exploité  in  every  way.  He  is  made  to 
perform  all  kinds  of  work  which  is  quite  aside  from  his  trade.  Therefore  he  only 
commences  to  learn his  trade  when  he  has  finished  his  apprenticeship  and  becomes 

40

International  Association  of Working  Men.  Report  of the  Congress  of  Geneva  (1866) 

a workman.  We  should  insist upon  this  question  for the  exploitation  of the  child  has 
something  in  it  more  iniquitous  than  that  of the  man. 

Citizen  Coullery  (Chaux-de-Fonds),  said—I  am  happy  to  see  the  Congress  take 
up  the  question  of woman.  We  ought  to  declare  in  a  categorical  manner  that  we 
work  as  much  for  the  emancipation  of woman  as  for  that  of man.  We  must  rescue 
her from the prostitution of the workshop  as well as from that of the  streets.  It is nec 
essary  that  her  education  be  as  complete  as  that  of man,  in  order  that  she  may  not 
become  the  dupe  of the  ministers  of any  religion  whatever.  In  a  word,  she  should 
have  the  means  of developing  herself completely,  both  in  mind  and body,  for  she  is 
the  hope  of the  human  species. 

5 

10 

Citizens  Chemalé,  Fribourg,  Perrachon  and  Camélinat  (Paris),  proposed  the  fol 

lowing  resolution: 

"On  physical,  moral  and  social grounds  the  labour  of women and  children  in  fac 
tories  ought  to  be  energetically  condemned  on  principle  as  one  of the  most  prolific 
causes  of  the  degeneracy  of the  human  species  and  as  one  of  the  most  powerful  15 
means  of  demoralisation  put  in  motion  by  the  capitalist  caste." 

Women,  they  added,  are  not made  to  work hard;  their place  is  at  the  family  fire 
side;  they  are  the  natural  educators  of  the  children;  they  alone  can  prepare  their 
children for  a  civic  and free  life.  This  question  ought to  be  debated  at the next Con 
gress.  The  scheme  of statistics  that  has  been  voted  will  furnish  a  powerful  body  of  20 ' 
facts  whereon  we  may  base  our  condemnation  of women's  labour  in  factories. 

Citizen  Varlin  (Paris),  said—Like  the  rest  of you,  I  admit  that  female  labour  in 
factories,  as  it  is  practised  at  present,  ruins  the  body  and  is  corrupting.  But  do  not 
let us  generalise  upon  this  fact  so  as  to  condemn  female  labour  in  general,  for  how 
can  you,  who  wish  to  rescue  women  from  prostitution,  effect  your  purpose  unless  25 
you  give  her  the  means  of  earning  her  livelihood.  What  would  become  of widows 
and  orphan  girls?  They  will  be  obliged  either  to  become  recipients  of  charity  or 
prostitutes.  To  condemn  female  labour  is  to  sanction  charity  as  an  institution  and 
authorise  prostitution. 

\ 

Citizen Fribourg  (Paris).  Widows  and  orphan girls  will  always be  exceptions  and  30 

cannot  in  any  way  impair  the  force  of the  rule  we  lay  down.  For  while  desiring  that 
all men  shall work,  we  know perfectly well that many men will  be  prevented  from  so 
doing  by  natural  accidents,  yet  we  insist  upon  the  rule.  Widows  and  orphan  girls 
will be  as  much  exceptions  to  the  general  rule  of their  sex  as  infirm  men  will  be  to 
the  rule  which requires  all men  to  work. 

35 

Citizen  Tolain  said—So  long  as  the  factory  is  open  to  women,  they  will  never be 
free  beings,  nor  able  to  develop  their  natural  aptitudes.  The  workshop  unsexes 
women. 

Citizen  Lawrence  (London),  said—There  is  something  stronger  than  all  our 
speeches here;  there  is  something more  true  than  all  the philosophic  sentiments we  40 
utter in this building and that is, the march of Society. We ought not to be theorising, 
we  are  working  men  and  therefore  should  aim  at  being  practical  rather  than  Utopi 
an.  Accordingly,  if we  wish  to  aid  in  an  efficient  manner  the  emancipation  of our 
class,  we must limit our  rôle  to  observing  what is  taking  place  around us,  to  gaining 
a  comprehension  of the  social  movement  and  not  to  think  of imposing  upon  it  our  45 

700 

Sittings  of  September  8,  1866 

personal  sentiments  and  theories.  As  the  commentary  of the  General  Council  very 
well  phrases  it  "the  tendency  of  modem  industry  is  to  make  the  woman  and  the 
child  cooperate  in  productive  labour."  This  is  so  true  that  in  certain  parts  of Eng 
land,  the  wife  goes  out  to  work  and  the  man  remains  at  home  and  does  the  house-
5  work.  We  of the  London  delegation  are  however far from  admiring the  way  in which 
woman  is  obliged  to  work,  but  the  fact  exists  and  it  would  be  folly  on  our  part  to 
condemn  female  labour  in  an  unqualified  manner,  but  what  we  may  do  is  to  pro 
test energetically against the exploitation of woman as it is carried on by the capital 
ist  caste. 

10 

The  commentary  of the  General  Council  on  this  subject  was  put  to  the  vote  and 

carried  by  a  large  majority. 

The  following  amendment  presented  by  Citizens  Varlin  and  Bourdon,  of  Paris, 

and  tending  to  add  point  to  the  English  Commentary,  was  put  to  the  vote  and  re 
jected. 

15 

20 

"The  lack  of education,  the  excess  of toil,  the  low  scale  of remuneration  and  the 
bad  hygienic  conditions  of factories  are,  under  the  present  state  of things,  causes  of 
physical  and moral  debasement for the  women  who  work therein.  These  causes  may 
be  destroyed by  a better organisation  of labour,  by  cooperation.  Woman has need to 
work  in  order  to  be  able  to  lead  an  honourable  life.  Our  aim  should  be  to  amelio-
rate  her labour and  not  to  suppress  it.  As  to  children we  ought to put  off the period 
of their  entrance  into  the  factory  as  much  as  possible  and  curtail  as  much  as  possi 
ble  their  hours  of labour." 

The  proposition  of  Citizens  Chemalé,  Fribourg,  Perrachon  and  Camélinat  was 

put  to  the  vote  and  adopted  by  the  majority. 

25 

On  the  subject  of the  education  of children,  the  French  delegates  proffered  the 

following  resolution  which  was  unanimously  adopted. 

"This  Congress  declares  that  technical  education  ought  to  be  both  theoretical 
and  practical.  In  default  thereof,  it  will  lead  to  the  establishment  of an  aristocracy 
based  upon  a  special  training  which  is  calculated  to  make  not  artisans,  but  foremen 

30  and  overseers  of artisans."

Nr. 14,  10. April  1867 

Sitting  of  September  8,  1866. 
(9  a.m.) 
Citizen  Jung  in  the  Chair.

Article  X. 
On  standing  armies  a nd  their  effects  on  production. 

Citizen  Dupont  (London)  opened  the  discussion  by reading  the  Commentary  of the 
General  Council  on  this  question. 

Citizen  Vuilleumier  (Chaux-de-Fonds)  proposed  the  following  resolutions: 

701 

International  Association  of Working  Men.  Report of the  Congress  of  Geneva  (1866) 

1.  The  Congress  acknowledges  that  the  system  of a  standing  army  is  in  flagrant 

contradiction  to  the  rational  progress  of  society. 

2.  And  while  aware  of  the  impossibility  of  immediately  effecting  a  radical 
change  in  this  state  of things  it  is  full  of confidence  that  the  association  of all  work 
ing  men  will  ultimately  cause  the  abolition  of standing  armies. 

The  French  delegates  proposed  the  following  series  of resolutions: 
1.  Standing  armies  take  away  from  industrial  labour  the  most  robust  men  to  re 
turn  them  (when  they  are  returned)  unfit  for  regular  work.  The  use  made  of them 
both  at  home  and  abroad  still  further  augments  the  dangers  wherewith  such  an  in 
stitution  menaces  industry. 

2.  The  militia  system,  that  is  to  say  the  arming  of the  whole  nation,  is  the  only 

one  which  can  be  admitted  as  a  transitional  process. 

3.  The  Congress  gladly  sees  the  efforts  which  are  being  made  for  the  abolition  of 
standing  armies  and  the  extinction  of war  and  antagonism  between  nations  and  ex 
presses  its  sympathies  with  all  those  who  have  devoted  themselves  to  the  diffusion 
of those  ideas  and  in  particular  to  the  founders  of the  Ligue  du  bien public. 

Citizen  Heidt  (Germany)  proposed  the  following  resolution,  which  was  supported 

by  citizens  Rau  and  Biirkli  (both  from  Germany) : 

The  Congress  recommends  the  sections,  wherever  circumstances  permit them,  to 
form  associations  for  military  exercise  as  much  as  possible  on  the  same  basis  and 
plan,  and  this  with  a  view  to  accelerate  the  general  arming  of the  people. 

Citizen  Heidt said:  Already  there  exist  such  associations  in  Germany  and  where 
the  Governments  prohibit  these  exercises,  sticks  are  substituted  for  guns  in  the 
gymnastic  schools. 

The  whole  meeting  approved  the  principles  developed  by  the  speakers  and 

adopted  all  the  resolutions. 

Article  XI. 
Religious  ideas;  their  influence  u p on  social,  political 
a nd  intellectual  progress. 

The  French  delegates  submitted  the  following  resolution: 

"The  Congress  affirms  the  physical  and  intellectual  liberty  of the  human  species 
and  declares  that  the  influence  of religious  ideas  tends  to  deny  man's  free  will  and 
his  dignity;  nevertheless  inasmuch  as  all religious  ideas  shun the  test of inquiry,  the 
Congress  confines  itself to  a  protest  against  this  influence  and  goes  on  to  the  next 
question." 

Citizen  Peter  (Germany)  said:  We  must  cease  to  confound  religion  with  moral 
ity;  they  are  two  things  entirely  distinct  from  each  other  and  even  contradictory  to 
each  other.  We  must  energetically  go  in  for  their  complete  separation  and  we  must 
unite  our  efforts  to  combat  religion,  which  has  been  a  greater  curse  than  standing 
armies  have  been. 

Citizen  Coullery  (Chaux-de-Fonds)  said:  Morality  has  been  tacked  on  to  the 
skirts  of  religion  and  been  subjected  and  dragged  through  the  mire  by  the  latter. 

702 

Sittings  of  September 8,  1866 

Morality  has  been  compelled  by  religion  to  excuse  and  to  authorise  all  the  crimes 
committed  by  the  latter.  We  must  emancipate  morality  from  this  fatal  tutelage. 
Morality  should  be  based  upon  reason  and  science.  Thus  elaborated,  it  should  be 
inculcated  to  children.  Religious  instruction  should  be  banished  from  the  schools 
in  an  unqualified  manner. 

5 

Citizen  Müller  (Germany)  protested  against  the  confounding  of morality  with  re 
ligion.  Religion  perverts  morality.  It  is  the  country  parts  where  religion  perpetrates 
its  ravages.  It  is  there  especially  that we  must  guard  against  it  and  go  in  for  the  in 
culcation  of  a  rationalistic  morality. 

10 

Citizen  Schlaifer  (Germany)  dwelt  upon  the  antagonism  between  morality  and 

religion  and  protested  against  the  influence  of the  clergy. 

Citizen  Card  (Poland)  denounced  religious  instruction,  the  injurious  effects  of 

which  were  particularly  felt  by  the  female  sex. 

Citizen  Bocquin  (Montreux)  spoke  in  the  same  sense  as  citizen  Schlaifer. 
Citizen  Vuilleumier  (Switzerland)  and  Schwitzguébel  (Germany)  proposed  the 

15 

following  resolution: 

"The  Congress  declares  that  it  desires  liberty  of  conscience,  the  separation  of 
Church  and  State  and  the  exclusion  from  all  schools  of  any  kind  of  religious  in 
struction." 

20 

Citizen  Tolain  (Paris)  said:  The  progress  of science  will  gradually  destroy  relig 
ious  prejudices  and  will  bring  mankind  to  a  sense  of its  dignity.  He  recommended 
that  the  Congress  should  not  come  to  any  resolution  on  the  subject. 

All  the  members  of the  Congress  were  unanimous  in  favour of ridding  the  human 
race  of  every  variety  of  religious  prejudices.  It  desired  that  note  be  made  of  this 

25  unanimity  and  thereupon  it  passed  to  the  next  question. 

Article  IX. 
T he  necessity  of  annihilating  the  influence 
of  Muscovite  despotism  in  E u r o pe  by  the  application 
of  the  right  of  n a t i o ns  to  dispose  of  their  own  destiny 
a nd  by  the  reconstitution  of  Poland 
on  a  democratic  basis. 

30 

Citizen  Card  (Poland)  and  Becker  (Germany)  were  desirous  that  the  Congress 
should  declare  in  favour  of this  question,  but the  meeting  considering  it  as  a  purely 
political  one  decided  not  to  discuss  it,  but  to  leave  to  the  German  and  Swiss  mem-
35  bers the power to  sign the following resolution  of Becker in favour of the reconstitu 

tion  of Poland. 

"Considering  that  by  the  development  and  consolidation  of the  International  As 
sociation  of Working  Men  every  despotism  will  disappear,  the  reconstitution  of Po 
land  on  a  democratic  basis  will  follow  as  a  matter  of course."

Afternoon 

Session. 

Citizen  Jung  in  the  Chair. 

Article  X I I. 
T he  establishment  of  Benefit  Societies. 

T he  affording  of moral  a nd  material  aid  to  orphans  left 
by  m e m b e rs  of  the  A s s o c i a t i o na ). 

5 

Citizen  Dupleix  (Switzerland)  said  that  all  the  adherents  to  the  Association  have 
called  for  the  establishing  of a  general  Society  of mutual  aid.  The  different  benefit 
societies  being  merely  local  ones,  many  working  men  lost  their  rights  on  migrating 
to  another  country.  The  Geneva  section  had  endeavoured  to  found  an  association  10 
whose  objects  are help  in  case  of sickness,  mutual  credit  and  support  to  the  orphans 
left  by  members  of  the  Association.  The  Geneva  section  demands  from  the  Con 
gress  its  endorsement  of this  Benefit  Society  in  order  that  if may  become  an  inter 
national  one. 

Citizen  Chemalé  (Paris)  would  recommend  that  the  different  Benefit  Societies  15 

be  linked  together  by  a  federal  tie;  but  it  would  be  difficult  to  realise  this  idea  in 
France,  as  all  these  societies  are  under  the  thumb  of  the  Government  and  their 
money  was  deposited  in  the  coffers  of the  State. 

Citizen Bocquin  (Montreux)  claims  that the  Geneva Benefit  Society  obviated  all 
the  difficulties  that  were  to  be  encountered  in  the  different  countries.  For this  pur-  20 
•••·•:[ 
pose,  each  Society  would  have  only  to  draw  at  sight  upon  the  branch  to  which  the 
member  aided  belonged,  in  order  to  get  its  advances  repaid,  and  he  thought  that 
this  method  would  be  completely  practicable  in  France. 

Citizen  Müller,  in  the  name  of the  Stuttgart  section,  spoke  as  follows:  A uniform 
code  of rules  ought  to  govern  all  the  federated  Benefit  Societies  without  which  the  25! 
international  aim  would  fail.  Already  in  Switzerland,  Germany  etc.,  there  exist 
Benefit  Societies  which  are  far  from  sufficing  for  the  public  needs.  It  is  only  by 
merging  an  enormous  mass  of them  into  one  mammoth  Association  that  better  re 
sults  can  be  obtained.  Consequently  a  central  organisation  appears  to  us  to  be  in 
dispensable.  It  would  receive  the  contributions  of all  the  sections  and  would  under-  30•' 
take  to  provide  for  their  outlay.  What  we  propose  is  already  carried  out by  fire  and 
life  insurance  offices.  We  should  only  have  to  work  after  their  models. 

The  London  delegation  proposed  the  following  resolution: 
"That  this  Congress  entirely  approves  of the  measures  taken  by  the  Geneva  Sec- 

; 
tion  in  the  establishment  of  Benefit  Societies  and  it  recommends  the  General  35 r 
Council  to  study  the  best  means  of establishing  the  principle  of the  same  upon  an 
international  basis." 

This  resolution  was  put  to  the  vote  and  carried. 
The  Lyonnese  and  Parisian  delegations  made  the  following  motion: 

( 1) This article appears neither on the London nor on the Paris Programme. It was, however, in-  40  ¡ 
¡ 
serted  in the  Geneva Programme  and was therefore introduced by  the  Swiss  delegates. 

704 

Sittings  of  September  8,  1866 

"The  assembled  delegates  while  acknowledging  the  desirability  of  establishing 
Benefit  Societies,  do  not however  think  that  the  moment  is  opportune  for  making  a 
general  measure  of it.  They  therefore  leave  each  section  free  to  constitute  these  So 
cieties,  as  well  as  Loan  Societies,  in  their  midst.  Moreover  they  appeal  to  the  sec-
tions  who  have  entered  on  this  path  to  draw up  special  reports  with  a view to  facili 
tate  the  development  of those  Societies."

Unanimously  adopted. 

Article  XIII. 
S e t t l e m e nt  of  the  R u l e s. 

• 

io  Citizen  Coullery  then read  the whole of the rules  through.  They were then  taken up 

one  by  one. 

Rules  1,  2  and  3  were  adopted  unanimously. 
Rule  4,  which  relates  to  the  annual  contribution  of members  was  the  object of the 

following  discussion. 

15 

Citizen  Dupleix  (Switzerland)  said  that  this  article  only  related  to  individual 
members;  the  different  Societies  adhering  to  the  principles  of the  International  As 
sociation  would  pay  a  round  sum  as  composition  money  for  their  members. 

Citizen  Coullery  wished  that  the  members  of  the  different  affiliated  bodies 

should  have  to  pay  a  smaller  sum  than  the  per  capita  contribution. 

20 

The French delegates,  on the contrary,  proposed that the contribution be personal 

and  therefore  equal  for  all. 

Citizen  Lawrence  (London)  warned  the  meeting  not  to  frighten  the  affiliated  so 
cieties  and  thought  that  they  should  be  encouraged  by  allowing  them  to  pay  a  com 
position. 

25 

Citizen  Fribourg  said:  Inequality  of obligations  would  entail  inequality  of rights. 

Therefore  he  argued  that  a  uniform  rate  should  be  charged  to  each  member. 

Citizen  Chemalé  (Paris)  said  that  as  a  matter  of principle  it  would  be  right  that 
all members  should  pay  the  same  contribution; yet,  considering the  exceptional  sit 
uation  of the  English Trades'  Unions,  he  was  willing  that  a  reduction  of 50  per  cent 

30  be  made  in  their  favour. 

Citizen  Camélinat  (Paris)  thought  that  an  unequal  contribution  could  not  be 
charged  without  being  false  to  the  devise  of  the  International  Association:  "No 
rights  without  duties."

The  discussion  on  this  point  continued  for  a  considerable  time. 
Citizens  Varlin  and  Fribourg  eventually  proposed  that  a  contribution  of 30  cen 
times  or  3  pence  be  established  exceptionally  for  the  year  1866-67  and  that  it  be 
levied  per  capita. 

This  proposition  was  put  to  the  vote  and  adopted.

The  International  Courier. 
Nr. 15,  17. April  1867 

Article  X I I I.  (Continued.) 
Settlement  of  the  Rules. 

Rules 5,  6,  7,  8,  9  and  10  were  unanimously  adopted. 

Rule  11,  relating  to  the  qualification  of a  delegate  gave  rise  to  the  following  de 

bate: 

5 

Citizen  Tolain  (Paris)  said:  If it  is  unobjectionable  to  admit  citizens  of every  so 
cial class  as  members  of the  International Association,  it  should  not be  so  when we 
come to fix the  qualifications for a delegate. In presence of the  existing social organ 
isation  in  which  the  working  classes  maintain  a  merciless  struggle  with  the  middle 
classes,  it is  expedient, yea indispensable,  that every representative of a section  be  a  10 
working  man. 

Citizen  Perrachon  (Paris)  speaks  in  the  same  strain  and  adds,  that  to  admit  a 
non-working  man  to  become  a  delegate  would  be  to  aim  at  the  destruction  of  the 
Association. 

Citizen Vuilleumier  (Switzerland)  said:  By eliminating  anyone from our Associa-  15 

tion,  we  should  set  ourselves  in  contradiction  with  our  general  Rules  which  admit 
as  members  every  individual without  distinction  of race  or  colour,  and  by  the  mere 
fact  of his  admission,  he  is  fit  to  become  a  candidate  for  election. 

Citizen  Cremer  (London)  regretted  that  this  invidious  question  had  been  raised. 
Among  the  members  of the  General  Council  there  are  several  citizens  who  are  not  20 
hand-workers  and  who  have  not  given  any  ground  of  suspicion.  Far  from  that,  it 
is  probable  that  but  for  their  devoted  co-operation,  the  Association  would  not 
have  struck  so  deep  a  root  in  Britain.  Among  those  members  I  will  mention  one 
only,  Citizen  Marx,  who  has  devoted  all  his  life  to  the  triumph  of  the  working 
classes. 

25 

Citizen  Carter  (London)  said:  The  personality  of  Karl  Marx  has  just  been  in 
voked.  That  distinguished  man  perfectly  understood  the  importance  of having  only 
hand-workers  as  delegates  to  this  first  International  Congress  of Working  Men.  Ac 
cordingly,  he  refused  the  appointment  which  was  offered  to  him  by  the  General 
Council.  But  that  sentiment  of delicacy  is  no  reason  for  passing  a  rule  to  exclude  30 
him,  or  any  one  else,  from  being  sent  to  our  Congresses.  On  the  contrary,  men  who 
devote  themselves  to  the  cause  of the  prolétaires  are  too  rare  to  make  it  expedient 
that  they  should  be  "snubbed."  The  middle  class  only  triumphed  when  it  allied  it 
self with  men  of  Science  and  it  is  the  pretended  science  of middle  class  political 
economy  which  gives  it  prestige  and  through  that  prestige,  ministers  to  its  power.  35 
Let  those  who  have  studied  political  economy  from  a  working  class  standpoint 
come,  by  all  means,  to  our  Congresses,  there  to  shiver  the  fallacies  of middle  class 
political  economy. 

Citizen Tolain  (Paris)  said:  As  a man  whose hands  are  brown with toil,  I  am deep 

ly  grateful  to  Citizen  Marx  for  having  refused  to  accept  the  appointment  of  del-  40 
egate  which  was  offered  to  him.  By  so  acting,  Citizen  Marx  intended  to  inculcate 

706 

Sittings  of  September  8,  1866 

that  delegates  to  working  men's  Congresses  should  be  hand-workers,  and  hand 
workers  only.  If we  admit  to  our  Congresses  men  of other  classes,  the  public  will not 
fail  to  say  that  the  Congress  does  not  represent  the  aspirations  of  the  working 
classes,  that  it  does  not  consist  of working  men.  I  think,  moreover,  that  it  is  well  to 
show  to  the world that we  are  sufficiently  advanced  to  be  able to  act  by  ourselves. 

5 

The  amendment  of  Tolain  wishing  to  impose  the  qualification  of  hand-workers 
upon  delegates  to the  Congress was  put to  the  vote,  and rejected  by  25  votes  against 
20. 

The  rule  as  it  stood  was  then  put  to  the  vote,  and  passed with  ten  dissentients. 
Rules  12,  13,  14  and  15  were  unanimously  adopted. 

10 

Seat  of General  Council. 
The  Assembly  decided  that  the  Seat  of the  General  Council  for  the  years  1866-67 
should  be  London. 

Continuation  of Powers. 

15  Citizen Eccarius  (London) proposed that the old General Council be re-appointed. 

20 

25 

The  Parisian  delegation  expressed  their  general  assent  to  this  proposal,  but  they 
had  an  exception  to  make  with  reference  to  Citizen  Le  Lubez,  who  (said  Citizen 
Fribourg)  had  been  guilty  of  calumnies  against  himself  and  Tolain  in  particular, 
and  against  the  Parisian  Section  of the  International  Association  in  general. 

A  serious  debate  arose  on  this  point. 
Citizens  Fribourg  and  Tolain  having  challenged  the  London  delegates  to  reply 
categorically to  the  question,  whether the  facts stated by  them  concerning Le  Lubez 
were  true,  and  the  London  delegates  having  admitted  the  accuracy  of  the  state 
ments  made  by  Tolain  and  Fribourg,  the  meeting  declared, 

"That  a  member of the  General  Council having  failed  in  his  duty  to  the  Associa 
tion  by  spreading  false  accusations,  without  supporting  them  by  any  proof,  or  any 
semblance  of proof,  that  member  must  be  struck  off the  list  of members  of the  Gen 
eral  Council." 

The meeting fixes the number of members of the General Council  at  50,  and pro-

30 

longs  their powers  until  the  next  Congress. 

Certificate  of Good  Conduct. 
The  meeting  adopted  in  reference  to  Citizens  Fribourg  and  Tolain  the  following 
resolution: — 

"The  Congress  declares  that  Citizens  Fribourg  and  Tolain  have  never  failed  in 

35 

their  duty  to  the  Association,  and  that  their  conduct  has  ever  been  upright."

Time  and Place  of next  Congress. 
On  the  motion  of Citizen  Cornaz,  the  Meeting  unanimously  decided  that  the  next 
Congress  should  be  held  at  Lausanne,  and  that  the  day  for  the  re-assembling  of the 
Congress  be  on  the  first  Monday  in  September,  1867. 

International  Penny  Postage. 
Citizen  Cremer  (London)  proposed  that  the  assembled  delegates  after  their  return 
to  their  respective  homes,  should  exert  themselves  in  favour  of  establishing  a  un 
iform  postal-rate,  which  would  reduce  to  1  penny  the  charge  on  a  letter  going  from 
one  nation  to  another.  He  proposed  that  a  committee  be  appointed  to go to  Geneva, 
Berne,  Paris  and  London  to  make  this  request. 

The  Meeting  adopted  the  motion  of Citizen  Cremer,  and  appointed  as  its  com 

mittee,  for  this  purpose,  the  London  delegates. 

The  President  then  announced  the  termination  of the  Congress.

"Darmstadt,  August  28,  1866. 
5  All  the  political  changes  in  Europe  which  at  present  so  strongly  preoccupy  men's 
minds  are  in  point  of real  significance  transitory  when  compared  with  the  changes 
which  are  germinating  in the  bosom  of European  Society,  and  the  public  on  the  ap 
pointment  of new  ministers  and  party  leaders  should  inquire  more  curiously  about 
their  social  ideas and capabilities  than  about their political  ones.  What  avails  the  full-
est  political  liberty  if the  largest  part  of the  human  race  is  at  the  same  time  suffer 
ing  from  want  and  destitution  and  if one  portion  of society  is  doomed  to  slave  and 
suffer  eternally  in order that the  other portion  may  enjoy  itself?  Whenever  this  idea 
has  penetrated  into  the  minds  of the  destitute  classes  and  the  resolution  to  better 
their  situation has been firmly taken,  the  social  revolution  is  at  once  accomplished. 
15  For  as  these  classes  form  an  immense  majority,  there  can  be  no  question  about  re 
sisting  them.  Unfortunately  the  recognition  of this  fact  among  working  men  is  still 
far  too  exceptional  and  sparse,  hence  their  want  of unity  and  mutual  understand 
ing.  The  more  you,  by  means  of your  Association,  strive  for  the  diffusion  of right 
views  and  disposition  among  the  largest  conglomerations  of the  working  classes,  so 
20  much  the  more  will you  aid  the  good  cause  and  the  international  bond you  seek  to 
form  is  an  excellent means  of arriving  at the  result  at which you  aim.  In this  way  it 
will  become  clear that unadulterated  humanity  is  everywhere  one  and  the  same  and 
that  the  European  peoples  are  destined  to  form  a  large,  affectionate  and  mutually-
aiding  family,  whereas  previously  they  have  been  hounded  on  by  their  rulers  to 
25  mutual murder  and  destruction  like  a  characterless  herd.  In this  way  it  cannot long 
remain  concealed  from  the  working  classes  that  the  division  which  has  been  made 
in  the  last  ten  or  twenty  years  between  the  so-called  'working  men'  and  the  so-
called  'Social'  question  is  an  unnatural  and  artificial  one  and  enuring  to  the  great 
disadvantage  of the  needy  classes.  According  to  my  rooted  conviction  the  working 
30  man's  question  can  never  be  thoroughly  solved  by  itself  and  apart  from  the  social 
question  and  all  the  infinitely  numerous  proposals  for  the  amelioration  of the  con 
dition  of the  working  classes,  whether  they  are  issued  from  the  Schulze-Delitzsch, 
Lassalle  or  intermediary  mints,  are  all  mere  palliatives  which  simply  prolong  the 
agony  of  death.  Especially  are  the  Co-operative  Associations  of  production,  as 
35  preached  by  Lassalle,  and  from  which  his  adherents  hope  to  extract  a  panacea  for 
all  evils,  only  a  means  for  raising  up  a  Fourth  Estate,  as  formerly  the  Third  Estate 
was  elevated,  and  to  make  room  for  a  still  more  suffering  Fifth  Estate  consisting  of 
working  men  not  employed  in  the  said  Co-operative Associations  and  of the  general 
mass  of working men.  The  root of the  evil is much  deeper than these  gentlemen  and 
their adherents  believe  or wish to  believe,  and  it  draws  its nourishment not from the 

40 

7 09 

International  Association  of Working  Men.  Report of the  Congress  of  Geneva  (1866) 

neglected  interest  of a  single  class,  but  from  the  unnatural  and  unjust  condition  of 
society  itself.  For  as  long  as  the  good  things  of life  or  the  means  of subsistence  are 
by  the  laws  of inheritance  and  without  any  personal  merit  divided  in  the  unequal 
manner  that  has  hitherto  prevailed,  it  is  nonsense  to  talk  of a  successful  competi 
tion  of the  less-favoured  individual  in  the  great  battle  of life,  except  of  course,  in 
rare  and  peculiar  cases.  The  liberal  middle  class  of our  day  who  are  demanding  as 
the  highest  aim  of personal  freedom  'a  free  course  of all,'  in  other  words,  free  play 
for the  development of all their powers  by  the  removal  of all limitations  imposed  by 
the  State,  entirely  forget  that  the  freedom  of the  course  is  not  sufficient  to  make  a 
successful  competition possible but that,  for that purpose,  there  is needed  an  equal-  10 
ity  of ways  and  means,  for  the  sustaining  of that  competition. 

5 

The  most vigorous  and  accomplished  working  man,  if empty  handed,  can  bear up 
against  the  power  of  Capital  as  little  as  the  naked  savage  can  against  artillery  and 
the  needle-gun.  All  this  is  so  self-evident  that  one  has  to  use  some  compulsion  over 
one's  self to  induce  one's  self to  repeat  it,  but  antiquated  custom has  so  blinded  the 
majority  of mankind  that  they  are  not  in  a  condition  to  comprehend  even  such  sim 
ple  truths  as  the  foregoing. 

15 

Of course  I  do  not  mean  to  say  withal  that  the  working  man  should  give  up  his 
previous  efforts  for  improving  his  condition.  On  the  contrary,  he  should  go  on  with 
them  and with  everything  else  that  can procure  him  even  a merely  transitory  allevi-  20 
ation  and  this  in  the  most  zealous  manner,  in  expectation  of  the  time  which  will 
permit  him  to  deal  with  the  evil  in  a  radical  manner.  But  while  doing  that  which 
lies  nearest  to  his  hand,  let him  never  forget  the  great  aim  of the  future,  for  which 
he  must  make,  and  which  alone  can  furnish  him  a  radical  and  lasting  cure  for  his 
evils.  Every  working  man  who  makes  that  the  aim  of his  life,  must  be  not  only  the  25 
friend  and  defender of his  class,  he  must  at  the  same  time  be  a  s o c i a l i s t,  he  must 
embrace  in  the  range  of  his  intellect  and  feeling  not  only  the  sufferings  of  his 
class,  but  also  those  of  society  itself.  In  this  latter  case  he  will  be  a  humanitarian 
and  a  Cosmo-politan,  while  in  the  other  case  he  will  be  only  a  c l a s s - e g o t i s t. 

Finally,  warn  your  working  men  in  their  efforts  for  the  future  to  confide  only  in  30 

themselves  and  in  a  few  tried  friends  if  they  desire  to  avoid  manifold  illusions. 
Neither  the  present  possessors  of power,  nor  the  liberal  middle  class,  nor  the  politi 
cal  democracy,  will  ever  do  anything  earnest  and  fundamental  for  them  except 
upon  compulsion.  Let  them  adopt,  therefore,  as  their  motto  the  device  of  'self-re 
liance'.  Amid  the  hurley-burley  of political  life,  you  will  be  sure  to  hear  many  who  35 
will  proclaim  themselves  to  be  'friends  of  the  people',  but  who  in  reality  are,  in 
some  respects,  their  most  dangerous  enemies.  Therefore  be  upon  your  guard!  Let 
deeds,  not  words,  speak! 

These  are  the  only  observations  I  have  to  make  to  you  and  your friends.  One  sub 
ject  of moment  I  have  not  mentioned,  I  mean  intellectual  emancipation.  I  take  it  40 
for  granted  that  the  working  man  who  is  striving  for  freedom  from  social  tyranny 
has  already  completed  in  his  interior  his  own  intellectual  liberation,  or at  least  has 
begun  the  process  of so  doing.  The  slavery  of the  mind  must  have  fallen  before  the 
bondage  enforced  by  the  State  and  by  society  can  fall. 

How  glad  I  should  have  been  to  have  been  present  at  your  Congress;  I  regret  to  45

Brothers, 

My  colleagues  who  compose  the  Central  Council  of  the  Working  Men's  Associa 
tions  of Italy  are  scattered  throughout  the  different  parts  of the  Peninsula.  Several 
have  taken  up  arms. 

I  acknowledge  that  it  would  be  necessary  for  our  working  men  to  have  at  least  a 
voice  in that great Assembly,  but  my  health is  too  broken  down  to  allow  of my  com 
ing  to  Geneva. 

I  assure  you  that  the  working  men's  societies  feel  the  need  of a federation  among 
themselves,  while  preserving  to  each  society  the  autonomy  which  is  befitting.  That 
is why,  last year,  there was  formed,  at Naples,  a Union  of whose  statutes I  send  you 
a  copy.  It  is  the  combined  forces  of many  that  have  ever  executed  the  greatest  and 
most  generous  projects. 

The  vital  principles  for  the  salvation  of the  working  classes  will  be  discussed  by 
the  delegates  from  the  various  nationalities.  The  Italian  working  men  offer  you 
their  hands  in  sign  of  brotherhood.  In  the  midst  of  the  grave  deliberations  with 
which  your  assembly  will  be  occupied,  throw  into  the  balance  the  votes  of Italian 
working  men  whenever  it  shall  be  proposed  to  proclaim  liberty,  equality  and  eman 
cipation from  the  modem  tyranny  of capital.  The  firm  and  unanimous  will  of work 
ing  men  is  bound  eventually  to  triumph  over  the  parasites  who  burden  society. 

Let  our  voice  aid  in  fraternising  the  people! 

Fraternally,

International  Association  of Working  Men.  Report  of the  Congress  of  Geneva  (1866) 

Appendix  B. 

Two  members  of the  Association  only,  so  far  as  is  known  to  the  General  Council, 
addressed  essays  to  the  Congress.  These were  Citizen Fox,  of London,  a member of 
the  General  Council  of the  Association,  and  Citizen  Leneveux,  of Paris,  one  of the 
founders  of  the  Parisian  Socialist  journal,  L'Atelier. 

The  Essay  of citizen  Leneveux  is  divided  into  15  sections  and  treats  of the  prin 
cipal  questions  in  the  Congressional  programme.  The  system  of apprenticeship,  ac 
cording  to  citizen  Leneveux,  is  a  domestic  drudgery  and  ought,  therefore,  to  be 
transformed.  A  strike  is  the  only  means  the  workman  has  of  defending  his  liveli 
hood.  Combination  of effort  is  the  working  man's  only  chance  of  salvation. 

The  Essay  of citizen  Fox  is  on  the  necessity  of restoring  the  independence  of Po 

land.  The  subject  is  handled  under  the  following  six  headings. 

1.  The  connection 

between 

the 

last  Polish 

insurrection 

and 

the  formation 

of  the 

Interna 

tional  Working  Men's  Association. 

2.  The 

claim 

of  Poland  on 

every  European  party. 

3.  On 

the  atonement  which  British  Democrats  owe 

to  Poland. 

4.  The  effect  of  the  French 

revolutions  of  1789  and  1792  upon 

the  destinies  of Poland. 

5.  The  Polish  question 

considered 

in 

its  bearing  upon 

the  past  and  future 

relations  be 

tween  Germany 

and  France.

In  my  last  I  endeavoured  to  point  out  under  what  peculiar  circumstances  the  pre 
requisites  of production  are  capital.  But there  is  both  a  history  and  a  theory  of capi 
tal.  The  former  is  generally  ignored  by  middle  class  economists;  the  latter,  with 
them,  is  the  theory  of confusion,  errors,  and  sophistry.  In  the  material  sciences  men 
commenced  with  things  as  they  found  them,  dissolved  them  into  their  component 
10  parts,  and  gradually  ascertained  their  origin.  The  professors  of political  economy, 
on  the  contrary,  took things  as  they  found  them  for granted;  left  the  origin  of capital 
to  take  care  of  itself;  invented  some  specious  theory  respecting  its  existence  and 
workings,  and  all  the  money-making  public  cried  "Amen!"  Had  they,  like  modern 
geologists  do  the  rocks,  dissolved  capital  into  its  component parts,  they  would  have 
arrived  at  conclusions  different to  those  they  have  arrived  at.  They  would  not  have 
met  with  so  much  applause  at  the  hands  of  the  magnates  of  modern  society  had 
they followed  this  course,  they would  rather have  had  to  encounter their hostility  as 
those  who  are  not  satisfied  with  writing  apologetic  eulogies  upon  the  existing  state 
of things,  but  dive  deeper  into  the  matter  have  to  do;  but political  economy  would 
20  have  become  a  science  under  their  hands,  instead  of  a  handmaid  of  the  ruling 
classes.  The  origin  of capital  is  the  division  of labour.  As  long  as  the  division  of la 
bour  was  confined  to  the  patriarchal  and  feudal  family,  capital  was  not  formed  and 
was  not  required.  When  the  division  of  labour  into  separate  and  organized  trades 
superseded  the  division  of  labour  in  the  family,  intermeddlers  established  them-
selves  to  distribute  some  of the produce  of other people's  labour.  In the  transit from 
the  producer  to  the  consumer  a  certain  amount  of  this  produce  stuck  to  their  fin 
gers which they accumulated.  In  due  course  of time money making, buying  and  sell 
ing,  became  the  aim  of production.  Those  who  had  appropriated  and  accumulated 
the  produce  of other  people's  labour  found  themselves  hampered  and  impeded  by 
the  guild  and  corporation  laws,  which  required  personal  and  technical,  not  wealth

owning  qualifications,  to  carry  on  the  business  of production.  The  so-called  mon 
eyed  interest  burst  these  fetters  which  had  been  forged  to  insure  a  subsistence  to 
the  handicraft  man,  to  convert the  runaway  serf into  a  free  citizen.  They  were  regu 
lations  which were  only compatible  with  a production  that  was for the most part cal 
culated  to  supply  local  wants.  The  enriched  intermeddler  required  a  world  for  his 
market,  and  labourers  who  had  either  to  do  his  bidding  or  die  of starvation.  He  fur 
nished  the  material  which  he  had  accumulated  out  of the  past  labour  of others,  and 
the  most needy had  to work them up  on his  own  premises  under his  immediate  con 
trol.  Thus  the  division  of labour  was  carried  into  the  workshop,  the  produce  of la 
bour became the  exclusive  property of the  employer,  the  labourer, the  producer,  be-  10 
came  an  appendage  to,  instead  of  an  agent  in,  the  process  of production,  buying 
and  selling,  exchange  value,  money-making  became  the  aim  of  production.  So 
much  for  the  history  of  capital,  now  for  the  theory.

"Parsimony,"  says  Adam  Smith,  "is  the  immediate  cause  of the  increase  of capi 
tal."  "Capital  is  the  result  of  saving,"  says  Mr.  Mill.  What  the  father  of  political  15 
economy  stated  a  hundred  years  ago  is  repeated  in  other  words  by  the  would-be 
Adam  Smith  of the  nineteenth  century,  the  man  of new  ideas.  Had  capitalist produc 
tion,  modem  industry,  not  advanced by  more  rapid  strides  than  her votaries—those 
who  profess  to  explain  her workings,  and  to  trace  the  path  upon  which  she  is  to pro 
ceed—it is a dead certainty that journeymen tailors would not be  able to publish ar-  20 
tides  on  political  economy  in  working  men's  papers.  Mr. Mill  in  his  sophistical  rea 
soning  assumes  that  abstinence  is  the  foundation  of  the  accumulation  of  capital. 
Let us  pause  to  examine  this  theory.  If the  man  whose  income  is  50,000/.  a  year  is 
content  to  live  upon  25,000/.,  he  will  have  25,000/.  to  dispose  of as  capital  the  fol 
lowing  year.  He  thus  abstains  from  consuming  25,000/.  which  he  might have  done.  25 
So  far  so  good.  But  how  does  he  get  the  50,000/.?  By  his  own  exertions!  It  never 
happened.  Mr. Mill,  again  repeating  Adam  Smith,  says:—"Everything which  is  pro 
duced  is  consumed,  both what is  saved  and  what  is  said  to  be  spent;  and  the  former 
quite  as  rapidly  as  the  latter.  When  people  talk  of the  ancient  wealth  of a  country, 
of  riches  inherited  from  ancestors,  and  similar  expressions,  the  idea  suggested  is,  30 
that  the  riches  so  transmitted  were  produced  long  ago,  at  the  time  when  they  are 
said to  have been  first  acquired.  The  fact  is  otherwise.  The  greater part,  in value,  of 
the  wealth now  existing  in  England  has  been  produced  by  human  hands  within  the 
last  twelve  months."  How  then  can  capital  be  the  result  of saving?  How  does  it hap 
pen  that  one  man  gets  50,000/.  worth  out  of the  produce  of one  year's  labour?  Ac-  35 
cording  to  Professor  Leone  Levi's  estimate,  which  I  have  no  reason  either  to  ques 
tion or endorse,  the  average  earnings  of adult male  labourers  in England  is  58/.  10s. 
a year.  The  man  with  50,000/.  therefore  gets  1,030  times  as  much  as  the  labourer.  I 
have  nearly  forty  years  of  business  experience  in  villages,  small  towns,  and  large 
towns,  and  different  countries,  but  I  never found  that  a  quick  and  industrious  man  40 
could,  under  equal facilities,  earn  twice  as  much  as  a  slow and  lazy  one.  But  here  is 
a  man  getting  one  thousand  and  thirty  times  as  much  as  the  average  labourer.  It 
may  be  objected  that  the  intellectual  labour  of direction  and  superintendence  de 
serves  a higher remuneration.  We  do not  know  that  the  50,000/.  man  directs  and  su 
perintends.  How intellectual labour is remunerated, unless a man is  in keeping with  45

A working  man's  refutation  ...  II. Capital—Its  formation  and  accumulation 

certain  parties  and  becomes  a  bishop  or  a  lord  chancellor,  we  all  know.  The  men 
who  are  engaged  to  direct  and  superintend  may  get  five,  ten,  even  twenty  times  as 
much  as  a good  skilled  workman  and  then  it will  not  amount  to  thousands.  The fate 
of Mr. Snider  is  a  striking  proof what  estimate  intellectual  labour  is  held  in.  Some 
5  years  ago  a  man  discovered  that  certain  poor  iron  ores  in  Scotland  contained  suffi 
cient  coal  for  their  own  smelting.  The  capitalists  of  the  neighbourhood  would  not 
even  advance  the  money to  test the  discovery  by  an  experiment on  a large  scale,  the 
man  died  in  penury,  and  the  capitalists  are  making  fortunes  out  of his  discovery  at 
the  present  moment.  This  shews  how  capitalists  value  the  intellectual  acquirements 
10  of others—it  is  for  the  poor  to  value  theirs.  Let  us  look  at  the  case  from  another 
side.  According  to  Professor  Leone  Levi,  the  annual  produce  of  the  labour  of the 
United  Kingdom  amounts  to  745,000,000/.  To  raise  this  produce  10,697,000  people 
of both  sexes,  under  sixty  years  of age  are  employed.  They  produce  on  an  average 
69/.  a  year  and  receive  as  remuneration  38/.  a  year.  Now  it  is  generally  acknowl-
edged  as  an  axiom  in  political economy  that labour determines  the  exchange value 
of goods,  that  is,  that  a  certain  quantity  of labour  embodied  in  a  certain  quantity  of 
what  will  exchange  for  another  certain  quantity  of  labour  embodied  in  the  fourth 
edition  of Mr. Mill's  essay  on  political  economy.

Thus,  when  the  farmer buys  books,  and  the  publisher buys  com,  real  equivalents 
are  exchanged  between  the  so-called  capitalist  producer  and  the  consumer.  The 
case  is  different  between  the  labouring  producer  and  the  capitalist  appropriators. 
Out of every  69/.  worth  produced  by  the  labouring  class  the  capitalist  class  appropri 
ates  31/.  worth  as  a  reward  for  having  taken  the  trouble  of appropriating  a  similar 
amount the  previous year.  This  is  the  secret how  one man  can  obtain  50,000/.  out of 
a production that yields  only  69/.  per head of the  effective  labourers;  it  is  the  secret 
of  the  formation  and  accumulation  of  capital.  The  Times'  correspondent  at  New 
York  told us  the  other  day  that  Alexander  J. Stuart,  merchant  and  importer  of New 
York,  had  returned  a  taxable  income  for  1865  of 4,071,256  dollars,  upon  which  he 
was  to  pay  a  tax  of 407,000  dollars.  Suppose  Mr. Stuart  to  be  an  abstemious  man, 
that  he  manages  to  defray  his  expenses  with  one  half of his  income,  say  two  million 
dollars,  that  he  devotes  a  hundred  thousand  a year  to  charitable  purposes,  and  lays 
by  1,500,000  dollars.  Without  interest  or  profit  upon  these  savings  they  would 
amount  to  15,000,000  dollars  in  ten years;  a  pretty  capital  the  result  of abstinence. 
Another  case:  A  New  York  gentleman  applied  the  other  day  to  an  insurance  com-
35  pany whose  policy  he  held  for  twenty-one  thousand  dollars  to  cover  the  loss  of his 
daughter's  wardrobe  by  fire.  The  young  lady's  wardrobe  contained  among  other 
things  twenty-six  robes  of silk  and  satin,  two  of velvet,  twenty-four  dresses  of other 
stuffs,  in  all  as  many  dresses  as  there  are  weeks  in  the  year.  There  is  not  the  re 
motest  doubt  that  this  young  lady  will  some  day  bring  to  the  man  of her  choice  not 
40  only  a  rich store of clothing but also  a  considerable  amount  of capital— the  result of 
abstinence.  But  whose  abstinence?  That  of the  Stuart's  and  the  likes  of that  young 
lady—the  abstinence  of which  Mr. Mill  speaks?  No;  the  plain,  unsophisticated  and 
untutored  working  men  know far  better—alas!  from  long  and  sad  experience—what 
kind  of parsimony  and  saving,  and  whose  abstinence  and  compulsory  privation  lay 
the  foundation  for  forming  and  accumulating  capital.

The  Commonwealth. 
Nr. 193,  17. November 1866 

III.  F u n d a m e n t al  Propositions  respecting  Capital. 

Sir  W. Hamilton  has  stated  that  a  man  may  think  upon  two  subjects  at  the  same 
time.  Mr. Mill's  capacities  far  exceed  this.  He  can  entertain  two  convictions  upon 
the  same  subject,  the  one  diametrically  opposed  to  the  other.  He  says:  "While  on  10 
the  one  hand  industry  is  limited by  capital,  so  on  the  other  every  increase  of capital 
gives,  or  is  capable  of giving,  additional  employment  to  industry;  and  this  without 
any  assignable  limit.  ...  Men  of  merit  (Malthus,  Dr.  Chalmers,  M.  de  Sismondi) 
have  contended,  that  if consumers  were  to  save  and  convert  into  capital  more  than 
a limited portion of their income,  and were not to  devote to unproductive  consump-  15 
tion  an  amount  of means  bearing  a  certain  ratio  to  the  capital  of the  country,  the 
extra  accumulation  would  be  so  much  waste,  since  there  would  be  no  market  for 
the  commodities  which  the  capital  so  created  would  produce."  To  prove  the  con 
trary  Mr. Mill  continues:  "Every  one  can  see  that  if a  benevolent  government  pos 
sessed  all  the  food,  and  all  the  implements  and  materials,  of  the  community,  it  20 
could  exact  productive  labour  from  all  to  whom  it  allowed  a  share  in  the  food,  and 
could  be  in  no  danger  of wanting  a  field  for  the  employment  of this  productive  la 
bour,  since  as  long  as  there  was  a  single  want  unsatisfied  (which  material  objects 
could  supply)  of any  one  individual,  the  labour  of the  community  could  be  turned 
to  the production  of something  capable  of satisfying that want.  Now,  the  individual  25 
possessors  of capital,  when  they  add  to  it by fresh  accumulations  are  doing precisely 
the  same  thing.  Let  us  imagine  the  most  extreme  case  conceivable.  Suppose  that 
every  capitalist  came  to  be  of opinion  that,  not  being  more  meritorious  than  a  well 
conducted  labourer,  he  ought  not  to  fare  better,  and  accordingly  laid  by,  from  con 
scientious  motives,  the  surplus  of his  profits;  or  suppose  this  abstinence  not  spon-  30 
taneous  but  imposed  by  law  or  opinion  upon  all  capitalists  and  landowners  like 
wise.  ...  The  whole  of what was  previously  expended  in  luxuries,  by  capitalists  and 
landowners,  is  distributed  among  the  existing  labourers,  in  the  form  of  additional 
wages.  ...  The  increased  accumulation  and  increased  production  might,  rigorously 
speaking,  continue,  until  every  labourer had  every  indulgence  of wealth  consistent  35 
with  continuing  to  work,  supposing  that  the  power  of their  labour  were  sufficient  to 
produce  all  this  amount  of  indulgences  for  the  whole  number.  Thus  the  limit  of 
wealth  is  never  deficiency  of consumers,  but  of producers." 

Now  for the  contrary  statements  and  admissions:  "Dearth,  or scarcity,  on  the  one 
hand,  and  oversupply  or,  in  mercantile  language,  glut  on  the  other,  are  incident  to  40 

718 

A working  man's  refutation  ...  III.  Fundamental  propositions  respecting  capital 

all  commodities.  In  the first  case,  the  commodity affords  to  the producers  or sellers, 
while  the  deficiency  lasts,  an  unusually  high  profit;  in  the  second,  the  supply  being 
in  excess  of that  for  which  a  demand  exists  at  such  a  value  as  will  afford  the  ordi 
nary  rate  of profit,  the  sellers  must  be  content  with  less,  and  must  even,  in  extreme 

5  cases,  submit  to  a  loss." 

"If the  present  annual  amount  of savings  were  to  continue  without  any  of those 
counteracting  circumstances  which  now  keep  in  check  the  natural  influence  of 
those  savings  in  reducing  profits,  the  rate  of profit  would  speedily  attain  the  mini 
mum,  and  all  further  accumulation  of  capital  would  for  the  present  cease." 

"The  resisting  agencies  are  of several  kinds.  First,  is  the  waste  of capital  in  peri 
ods  of overtrading and  rash  speculation,  and  in  the  commercial  revulsions  by which 
such times  are  always  followed.  ...  Mines  are  opened,  railways  or bridges made,  and 
many  other  works  of  uncertain  profit  commenced,  and  in  these  enterprises  much 
capital  is  sunk  which yields  either no  return,  or none  adequate  to  the  outlay.  Facto-
ries  are  built  and  machinery  erected  beyond  what  the  market  requires  or  can  keep 
in  employment.  ...  Besides  this  there  is  a  great  unproductive  consumption  of capi 
tal  during  the  stagnation  which  follows  a  period  of general  overtrading.  Establish 
ments  are  shut  up  or  kept  working  without  any  profit,  hands  are  discharged  and 
numbers  of  persons  in  all  ranks,  being  deprived  of  their  income,  and  thrown  for 
support on their savings,  find  themselves,  after the  crisis has passed away,  in a con 
dition  of more  or  less  impoverishment.  By  the  time  a  few  years  have  passed  over 
without  a  crisis,  so  much  additional  capital  has  been  accumulated,  that  it  is  no 
longer  possible  to  invest  it  at  the  accustomed  profit:  all  public  securities  rise  to  a 
high  price,  the  rate  of interest  on  the  best  mercantile  securities  falls  very  low,  and 
the  complaint  is  general  among  persons  in  business  that  no  money  is  to  be  made. 
Does  not this  demonstrate  how  speedily  profit would be  at  a  minimum,  and  the  sta 
tionary  condition  of capital would  be  attained,  if these  accumulations  went  on  with 
out  any  counteracting  principle?"

Which  is  Napoleon  and  which  is  Wellington?  Whichever you  like,  my  little  dear; 
30  take  your  choice.  The  increase  of  capital  gives  employment  without  any  assignable  limits, 
overproduction  is nonsense,  but,  the accumulation  of capital would come to  a standstill if 
overtrading  did  not periodically  annihilate  a  large  amount  of capital,  destroy  implements 
of  production,  and  throw  hundreds  of  thousands  out  of  work. 

And  what  is  "overtrading"  but  over-production?  Suppose  that  Mr. Stuart,  at  New 
35  York,  imported  500,000/.  worth  of British hardwares  five  years  ago  and  that  his  de 
mand  increased  at  the  rate  of ten  per  cent,  per  annum  on  the  original  amount,  pro 
duction  would  accommodate  itself to  the  demand.  But  in  the fifth year,  his  custom 
ers  being  well  supplied,  would  principally  replace  the  wear  and  tear  of  their  old 
stock,  and  require  only  400,000/.  worth.  The  moment  Mr. Stuart  became  aware  of 
such  a  state  of  things  he  would  telegraph  to  his  agents  here  that  he  required  no 
more  at  present;  there  would  be  £350,000  worth  of unsaleable  stock,  and  those  who 
had  bills  discounted  upon  such  stock  might  find  their  names  in  the  Gazette;  bank 
ers would  follow,  workpeople would be put on  short time,  or factories  shut up;  other 
trades,  having  run  in  the  same  path,  would  follow  the  same  course.  There  would  be 
45  more  means  than  ever  of satisfying  wants,  but  the  mass  of the  people  would  starve 

40 

719 

Johann  Georg  Eccarius 

and  perish  from  want,  because  they  could  not  pay  for  what  they  had  produced  too 
much.  This  is  what  is  implied  in  the  phrase  "overtrading;"  yet  Mr. Mill  asserts  that 
there  is  no  such  thing  as  a general  over-supply,  above  the  demand,  as  far as  it  con 
sists  in  the  means  of  payment.  The  reduction  of  profits  to  a  minimum  is  the  wind-up  of 
the  capitalist  mode  of  production,  the  end  of  the  contest  between  labour  and  capital,  the  5 
emancipation  of the  hard-working,  hard  living,  down-trodden  millions. 

Although  Mr. Mill  refutes  his  own  statements,  his  first  supposition  is,  neverthe 
less,  abstractedly  true;  but  both  the  first  and  the  second  are  totally  incompatible 
with,  and  inapplicable  to,  the  present  state  of society.  The  conception,  it  appears  to 
me,  stands  in  the  same  relation  to  the  conception  of the  reality  of such  a  state  of  10 
things  as  the  flying  fish  to  the  eagle.  Mr. Mill  has  a  faint  anticipation  of a  state  of 
things  in  which  the  satisfying  of wants,  and  that  alone,  might  be  the  incentive  to 
production,  but  he  cannot  elevate  his  conception  above  a  state  of society  in  which 
the  materials  and  instruments  of production  are  the  private  property  of individuals. 
As  long  as  the  prerequisites  of production  are  the  property  of  capitalists,  so  long  15 
will  money-making  continue  to  be  the  direct  aim  of  production,  so  long  will  they 
abhor  the  idea  "of not  being  more  meritorious  than  a  well-conducted  labourer."  As 
long  as  they  obtain  profits,  so  long  the  producers  will  have  to  work  for  wages,  for 
less  than  their labour is  worth,  which will prevent  "what  was  previously  expended  in 
luxuries  to  be  distributed  among  them,"  and  will  preclude  them  from  the  indul-  20 
gence  of wealth;  finally,  as  long  as  the  capitalists  are  the  controllers  of production, 
so  long  no  law  or  opinion  will  be  imposed  which  will  prevent  those  who  work  the 
least  to  get  the  most. 

Now  for  the  "benevolent  Government."  This  supposition  implies  a  state  of  so 
ciety  in  which  the  materials  and  instruments  of production  are  the joint  property  of  25 
the  community,  and  the  direction  of production  the  function  of the  Government.  It 
implies  a  state  of  society  in  which  the  old  proverb  "he  who  does  not  work  neither 
shall  he  eat"  has  become  a  reality.  It  implies  a  state  of society  which  has  been  pre 
ceded  by  such  a  course  of  training  and  education  as  the  Congress  of  the  Interna 
tional Workingmen's Association recommends for society at large;  a state of society  30 
in  which,  if a  thousand  days'  work  is  to  be  done,  and  a  thousand men  to  do  it,  each 
will  work  a  day.  It  implies  a  state  of  society  in  which  the  public  Government  per 
forms  the  same  functions  as  the  directors  of a joint-stock  company  for  such  a  com 
pany.  It  implies  a  state  of  society  of which  the  present  co-operative  movement  is 
only the germ.  There would not even be the  semblance of benevolence  about such a  35 
Government,  it  would  only  perform  a  bounden  duty.  As  long  as  the  members  of a 
government  are  only  the  nominees  of a  class,  so  long  they  will  have  to  legislate  for, 
and  defend,  that  class,  and  if that  class  happens  to  be  in  possession  of all  the  mate 
rials  and  instruments  of production,  no  amount  of individual  benevolence  will  en 
able  the  Government  to  direct  production  to  the  supplying  of  wants,  instead  of  40 
profit-making  for  individual  proprietors.

Lest  my  readers  should  run  away  with  the  idea  that  Mr. Mill  contradicts  himself in 
the  same  breath,  it  is  necessary to  state  that  there  is  a  considerable  interval  between 
the  two  statements  I  cited  in  my  last  article.  The  first,  the  hopeful  view,  which gives 
to  the  capitalist  mode  of production  so  universally  beneficent  a  character,  appears 
in  the  first  volume,  published  in  1857;  the  second,  the  dry  statement  of the  stem 
reality,  occurs  towards  the  end  of the  second  volume,  published  in  1859.  But  be 
tween  these  statements  there  are  others  of  a  similar  nature  which  require  elucida 
tion.

Recurring  to  the  opinion  of Malthus,  Dr.  Chalmers,  and  Sismondi,  about  over 
production,  Mr.  Mill  says:—"When  these  writers  speak  of the  supply  of commodi 
ties  as  out-running  the  demand,  it  is  not  perfectly  clear  which  of the  two  elements 
of  demand  they  have  in  view—the  desire  to  possess  or  the  means  to  purchase; 
whether  their  meaning  is  that  there  are,  in  such  cases,  more  consumable  products 
in  existence  than  the  public  desires  to  consume,  or  merely  more  than  it  is  able  to 
pay  for.  Let  us  suppose  that  the  quantity  of  commodities  produced  is  not  greater 
than  the  community  would  be  glad  to  consume:  is  it,  in  that  case,  possible  that 
there  should  be  a  deficiency  of demand  for  all  commodities,  for  want  of the  means 
of payment?  Those  who  think  so  cannot  have  considered  what  it  is  that  constituted 
the  means  of payment for commodities.  Each person's  means  of paying for the  pro 
ductions  of other people  consists  of those  which he  himself possesses.  All  sellers  are 
inevitably  and  ex  vi  termini  buyers.  Could  we  suddenly  double  the  productive  pow 
ers  of  the  country,  we  should  double  the  supply  of  commodities  in  every  market; 
but we  should,  by  the  same  stroke,  double  the  purchasing  power.  Everybody  would 
25  bring  a  double  demand  as  well  as  a  double  supply:  everybody would be  able  to  buy 
twice  as  much  in  exchange.  At  any  rate  it  is  sheer  absurdity  that  all  things  should 
fall  in  value,  and  that  all  producers  should  in  consequence  be  insufficiently remun 
erated.  If values  remain  the  same,  what  becomes  of prices  is  immaterial,  since  the 
remuneration  of  producers  does  not  depend  on  how  much  money,  but  on  how 

20 

30  much  of consumable  articles,  they  obtain  for  their  goods. 

A  general  oversupply,  or  excess  of all  commodities  above  the  demand,  so  far  as 

demand  consists  in  the  means  of payment  is  thus  shown  to  be  an  impossibility." 

Four  chapters  further  we  are  told—"There  is  no  absurdity  in  the  hypothesis  that 

of some  given  commodity  a  certain  quantity  is  all  that  is  wanted  at  any  price." 

35 

40 

Under existing  circumstances  I  consider wheat  as  the  commodity  of which  only  a 
certain  quantity  is  wanted  at  any  price,  and  it  is  because  wheat  is  an  indispensable 
necessary of life, a commodity of which everybody, except those who are out of work, 
and  those  who  are  on  the road  to  the  workhouse,  gets  his  share.  What  is  the  effect  of 
the  supply  on  the  price  of wheat?  The  following  passage  is  quoted  from Tooke's  his-
tory  of prices  by  Mr.Mill:—"The  price  of corn  in  this  country  has  risen  from  100  to 
200  per  cent,  and  upwards,  when  the  utmost  computed  deficiency  of the  crops  has 

721 

Johann  Georg  Eccarius 

not been  more  than between  one  sixth  and  one  third  below  an  average,  and  that  de 
ficiency  relieved  by  foreign  supplies."  On  the  other  hand  when  the  supply  exceeds 
the  average  the fall  is  as  disproportionate.  The  agricultural  statistics  of France  show 
that  in  1817  the  forty-eight  millions  of hectolitres  of wheat  harvested  in  that  year 
were  worth  two  thousand  million  francs,  while  nearly  sixty-four  millions,  harvested 
in  1819,  were  only  worth  one  thousand  and  one  hundred  millions.  The  increase  of 
the produce was  in  the proportion  of 3  to  4;  the  decrease  in price was from 41  to  17 
per  hectolitre. 

5 

In this  country  the  average  price  of wheat  from  1850  to  1864  was  about 21.  10s.  a 
quarter.  The  average price  for the  year  1851  was  38s.  6d.  a  quarter with  a  supply  of  10 
home,  and  foreign  wheat  of 42,391,875  cwts.;  in  1855  the  supply  fell  to  36,469,782 
cwts.,  and  the  price  for the year rose  to  74s.  8d.  For  every  seven 41b.  loaves  that had 
been  baked  in  1851  there  were  but  six  in  1855,  but  the  six  cost  nearly  six  shillings, 
while  the  seven were  sold for something  like  three  shillings  and  sixpence.  The  cause 
of these  fluctuations  is  this:  whether  bread  is  dear  or  cheap  the  poor  must  have  a  15 
certain  quantity  to  support  life;  if bread  be  dear  all  other  articles  of  consumption 
have  to  be  curtailed,  some  even  abandoned,  to  obtain bread.  There  is  even  a  possi 
bility  of more  bread  being  consumed  in  the  poorest  families  when  it  is  sufficiently 
dear  to  prevent  the  consumption  of butcher's  meat.  There  is  little  difference  in  the 
quantity  of wheat consumed whether it  is  dear or  cheap  unless  it reaches the famine 
price.  When  the  price  of  bread  falls,  the  poor,  instead  of  eating  more  bread,  in 
crease  their  consumption  of  everything  else  that  comes  within  their  reach,  except 
bread.  This  explains  the  reason  why  butcher's  meat  rises  in  price  when  bread  is 
cheap,  and  remains  stationary  when  bread  is  dear. 

20 

Next  to  wheat,  butcher's  meat  is  an  article  the  consumption  of which  could  not  25 

be  increased  beyond  the  actual  want.  The  well-to-do  getting  already  as  much  as 
they  require,  no  fall  in  the  price  would  induce  them  to  eat more.  A fall  in  the  price, 
or an  increase  in the  means  of payment  of the  poor would  no  doubt  result  in  a large 
increase in the  consumption of butcher's meat; but,  like bread,  it would have its lim 
it.  What  holds  good  with  bread  and  meat  holds  good  with  every  other  article  of  30 
commerce,  with  this  difference,  that  the  means  of payment  and  the  desire  to  pos 
sess,  of those who  have  the  means,  are  the  limits  of the  demand.  The  rich  could  buy 
more  gold  watches  than  they  do,  but  they  buy  only  a  certain  number,  and  if  the 
watch  makers  make  more  than  the  rich  are  willing  to  buy,  the  surplus  is  overpro 
duction that cannot be  sold  at all,  or must be  sold  at  a loss  to  people who  are  either  35 
not  willing  or  not  able  to  buy  at  the  remunerative  price.  The  gentlemen  who  wear 
the  broad  cloth,  which  the  London  drapers  cannot  sell  for  less  than  25s.  a  yard,  re 
quire  only  a  certain  quantity,  if much  more  were  produced  it  would  be  dead  stock. 

Now,  we  are  ready  to  enter upon  the  examination  of Mr.  Mill's  supposition.  Sup 
pose  the  Wizard  of the  North  could  by  one  stroke  double  the  production  of every- 
thing,  except  man  himself,  his  stomach  and  his  stature,  two  suits  of  clothes,  two 
quarters  of wheat,  two  cwts.  of beef,  and  two  ounces  of gold  would  respectively  rep 
resent  the  same  amount  of  labour  as  before,  and  ought  to  exchange  in  the  same 
proportion  as  they  do  now,  otherwise  it  would  not  be  immaterial  what  became  of 
prices.

A working  man's  refutation  ...  IV.  Excess  of supply 

Under  existing  circumstances  the  selling price  is  the form in which the  labour ex 
change  value  must  be  realised.  Amongst  the  various  products  of labour  gold  is  the 
only one of which everybody is ready to appropriate any conceivable amount. Every 
thing  else  is  produced  to  be  sold  for  gold;  it  is  only  with  respect  to  the  commodity 
5  gold  that  all sellers are  inevitably  buyers,  hence  it  is  that  the  quantity  of gold which  a 
given  article  will realise,  determines the  success  or failure  of the producer,  and what 
becomes  of prices  is  of the  utmost  consequence.

Suppose  our  old friend,  farmer Brown,  came  to  market with twice  as  much wheat 
as  he  used  to,  and  the  forestaller,  the  miller,  and  the  baker,  had  twice  as  much gold 
as  they  used  to  have;  but,  having  lately  discovered  that  the  poor,  instead  of eating 
more  bread  on  account  of it  being  more  abundant,  were  drinking  more  beer,  eating 
more  meat,  and  looking  out for  finer  clothes  than formerly,  they would  only buy the 
customary  quantity  of wheat,  its  price would,  at  the very  least,  fall  from 40s.  to  20s., 
and  farmer  Brown's  purchasing  power,  instead  of having  doubled  would  be  reduced 
15  by  50  per  cent.,  while  the  liabilities—liabilities  which  could  only  be  met  by  hard 
cash—would  have  increased  100  per  cent.  Suppose  the  farmer  was  in  a  position  to 
tide  over  the  difficulty  for  a  season,  would  he  continue  working  his  farm  as  before? 
Certainly not.  He  would  employ  fewer hands,  buy  fewer  implements,  none  at  all for 
a  season,  land  would  be  thrown  out  of cultivation  and  rents  would  fall,  and  the  pur-
chasing  power  of the  farmer's  tradesmen  and  their workpeople  would  be  reduced  to 
zero.  We  see  now  that  it  matters  very  materially  what  becomes  of prices  and  that 
Mr. Mill's  supposition  about  everybody's  purchasing  power  being  doubled  is  sheer 
nonsense. 

20 

25 

I  have  selected wheat  to  illustrate  the  subject,  because  it  exhibits  the  phenomena 
to  which  I  desired  to  direct  the  reader's  attention,  in  the  most  striking  and  unmis 
takable  manner.  That  many  other  commodities  would,  at  the  very  outset,  share  the 
fate  of  wheat  is  beyond  question,  particularly  mere  necessaries.  There  are  some 
which  are  both  necessaries  and  luxuries,  the  consumption  of which  is  not  limited 
by  want.  Upon  an  increase  of means,  the  poor might far more  than  double  their use 
30  of furniture  and  clothing,  either  by  a  direct  increase,  or  by  replacing  old  ones  by 
new  and  better,  without  being  extravagant.  Although  a  man  could  not  eat  a  dozen 
times  as  much  as  another  decently  fed  man,  there  are  plenty  [of]  vain  people,  fond 
of  show,  who  wear  out,  or  spoil,  a  dozen  suits  of  clothes  where  other  decently 
dressed  folks  will make  one  suit  suffice.  In  the  same way  a man may keep  a number 
35  of carriages  and  horses  to  match;  but  no  one  will  keep  two  carts  and  horses  for the 
work  that  one  can  do.  The  dead  lock to  production  will  therefore  arrive  sooner  with 
regard  to  necessaries  than  luxuries.  On  the  other  hand  what  tends  most  to  a  greater 
steadiness  in  the  prices  of  manufactured  goods  than  of  wheat  is,  that  production 
can  be  arrested  at  any  stage  of the  process  when  prices  decline,  and  that  it  can  be 
accelerated when they rise,  and  that few are so hard pressed as not  to  be  able  to sus 
pend  purchasing  for  a  time  when  prices  run  too  high.  Nevertheless  a  general  over 
supply  and  a  ruinous  fall  of  prices  periodically  occur,  as  Mr.  Mill  so  distinctly 
points  out.

On  this  subject  we  have  a  statement,  a  contradiction,  and  a  prevarication.  If a  sim 
pleton  were  asked  why  so  many geese  are  brought  to  London  at  Christmas  time,  he 
would  probably  reply—why,  because  the  people  want  them  for  Christmas  dinner, 
you  know.  There  is  also  a  notion  abroad  that  country  people  rear  and  fatten  geese 
for  the  very  purpose  of  selling  them  to  the  London  dealers,  and  that  the  London 
dealers  bring  them  to  market  because  they  know,  from  experience,  that  many  peo 
ple  would  not be  contented without  a  Christmas  goose.  But this  is  an  every  day view 
of the  matter.  Mr. Mill  endeavours  to  dispute  the  correctness  of this  vulgar  notion. 
He  says:—"What  supports  and  employs  productive  labour  is  the  capital  expended 
setting  it  to  work,  and  not  the  demand  of purchasers  for  the  produce  of the  labour 
when  completed.  Demand  for  commodities  is  not  demand  for  labour."  According 
to  this  version  it  is  not  the  knowledge  of  the  fact  that  the  London  people  buy  so 
many  geese  that  induces  country  people  to  rear  many  more  than  they  want  for  15 
themselves,  but  it is because  they  are  fond  of,  and have  the means  for,  rearing  geese 
that  they  do  it.  What  does  the  following  passage,  in  the  Times  of November  19,  im 
ply?—"The  manufacturers'  order  books  are  very  badly  supplied—insufficiently  in 
many  instances  to  keep  the  men  working  nearly  full  time."  This  is  from  Bir 
mingham.  Are  orders  a  "demand  for  the  produce  of  labour  when  completed"  or  20 
not?  Do  these  orders  exercise  any  influence  upon  the  amount  of labour  employed 
by  the  hardware  manufacturer  or not?  But  independent  of the  fact,  that  the  employ 
ment  of  a  very  considerable  amount  of  labour,  in  many  branches  of  industry,  de 
pends  upon  the  direct  orders  and  demand  of  the  consumers  for  finished  goods, 
what is the ruling guide for the  employment of labour,  in those  branches of industry 
in  which  the  production  of ready made  goods  is  the  rule,  and  orders  the  exception? 
The  facility  to  sell.  The  trade  reports  of November  17  are:  Bradford,  "Stocks  in 
crease  and  prices  droop.  Manufacturers  of  plain  goods  are  working  short  time." 
Leeds,  "Several  large  woollen  mills  are  working  short  time."  Manchester,  "The 
manufacturers  in  the  surrounding  districts  have  unanimously  resolved  to  work  four  30 
days  a week instead  of six;  in many  other parts  of Lancashire  spindles  and  looms  by 
thousands  are  idle."  "In  making  sales  of either yarn  or  cloth the manufacturers have 
almost  to  force  them  on  the  market  at  a  heavy  reduction."  I  ask,  then,  does  the  de 
mand  for  commodities  determine  the  demand  for  labour  or  not?  Is  it  from  want  of 
capital,  or  is  it  from  want  of purchasers  that  the  factory  labourers  are  put  on  short  35 
time? 

25 

Let  us  now  hear what  Mr.  Mill  has  to  say  in  elucidating  his  erroneous  statement. 
He  continues:—"Suppose,  for  instance,  that  there  is  a  demand  for  velvet;  a  fund 
ready  to  be  laid  out  in  buying  velvet  but  no  capital  to  establish  the  manufacture.  It 
is  of no  consequence  how great the  demand  may be; unless  capital  is  attracted  into  40 

724 

A working  man's  refutation  ...  V.  Effect  of  the  demand  for  commodities  ... 

the  occupation,  there  will be  no  velvet made,  and  consequently none bought,  unless 
the  intending  purchaser  makes  advances  to  workpeople  that  they  may  make  velvet, 
i.e.,  to  convert part of his  own  income  into  capital.  Let us  now  reverse  the  hypothe 
sis,  and  suppose  that  there  is  plenty  of  capital  ready  for  making  velvet  but  no  de-

5  mand,  velvet  will  not  be  made. 

Manufacturers  and  their  labourers  do  not  produce  for  the  pleasure  of their  cus 
tomers,  but for the  supply  of their own wants,  and  having still the  capital and the  la 
bour,  which  are  the  essentials  of  production,  they  can  either  produce  something 
which  is  in  demand,  or  if there  be  no  demand,  they  themselves  have  one,  and  can 

10  produce  things  which  they  want  for  their  own  consumption." 

20 

This  is  "confusion  worse  confounded,"  and  logic  most  unmercifully  outraged. 
Let  us  analyse  this  kettle  of  fish.  If velvet  can  be  made  after  an  advance  of money 
by  the  intending  purchaser,  then  the  prerequisites  to  the  production  of  velvet, 
Mr. Mill's  capital  per se,  must  exist  in  a  latent  state,  waiting  to  be  absorbed  in  the 
15  process  of velvet  making.  But  Mr. Mill  does  not  dispute  this.  He  has  for  the  mo 
ment  forgotten  the  caution  he  gave  at  the  outset,  he  confounds  money  with  capital; 
what  he  really  means  to  say  is,  that  though  there  may  be  workmen  possessing  the 
requisite  knowledge  and  skill for making velvet,  the  tools  and  materials  in  the ware 
house  of  the  dealer  ready  to  enter  the  workshop  upon  their  price  being  tendered, 
and  the  purchasing price  of the velvet  in the  hands  of the  intending  purchaser,  if no 
intermeddler,  possessing  a  third  equivalent  in  money,  step  in  to  purchase  the  tools 
and  materials  and  employ  the  workpeople  velvet  will  not  be  made,  unless  the  in 
tending  purchaser  and  the  workmen  contrive  to  do  without  him.  Mr. Mill  tells  us 
that  in  this  case,  the  intending  purchaser  converts  part  of his  income  into  capital. 
25  No  such  thing.  What  he  advances  is,  the  whole  or  part  of the  price  of the  velvet, 
which he  parts  with  to  gratify  a  desire.  In  gratifying  this  desire  he  may  also  satisfy  a 
want,  that  of clothing  himself;  but  he  expects  no  pecuniary  return—nothing beyond 
the  pleasure  of wearing  velvet  and  displaying  his  wealth.  His  advancing  money  to 
obtain  velvet  is  no  more  an  investment  of capital  than  a gentleman  advancing  mon-
ey  to  an  ostler to  procure  him  a  fine  horse  for  his  carriage.  The  money  invested  in 
the  purchase  of Pickford's  vans  and  horses  and  the  wages  paid  to  the  drivers,  form 
an  outlay which  is  expected  to  replace  itself with  a profit,  hence  it  is  capital;  but the 
money  expended  for  the  horses  and  carriages  of the  Marquis  of Westminster,  and 
the  wages  paid  to  his  grooms  and  coachmen  form no  outlay,  it  is  expenditure  which 
is  not  expected  to yield  anything  beyond  the  pleasure which horses  and  carriages  af 
ford,  hence  it  is  not  capital.  The  simple  admission  that  velvet  can  be  made  without 
the  capitalist  employer,  if  the  demand  for  it  be  accompanied  by  its  purchasing 
price,  is fatal to  Mr.Mill's  fundamental proposition.  According  to  the  ordinary rules 
of  reasoning  the  reversed  hypothesis  should,  at  least,  hide  the  wound  which  this 
side  stab  has  inflicted,  but,  instead  of doing  that,  it  enlarges  it  into  an  irreparable 
rent,  for it  states  positively  that  with  all  the  capital  in  the  world  being  ready  for vel 
vet making,  if there  be  no  demand,  velvet  will  not  be  made.  We  are  thus  irresistibly 
led  to  the  conclusion  that  if the  demand  for  a  commodity  be  accompanied  by  its 
purchasing price  the  commodity  will be produced,  but that  in  the known  absence  of 
45  a  demand  nothing  will  be  produced;  hence  demand  for  goods,  and  not  capital  as 

40 

35 

30 

such,  creates  the  demand  for  labour. 

725

Mr. Mill  is  fully  conscious  of this,  but  his  unbounded  faith  in  the  inherent  pro 
pensities  of capital to  promote  production  at  all  hazards  leads  him to  have  recourse 
to  prevarication.  How  do  people  supply  their  own  wants  in  modern  society?  By 
making,  from  the  cradle  to  the  grave,  things  for  everybody's  use  except  their  own. 
The  cotton-miller  and  his  hands,  the  tailors,  the  shoemakers,  etc.,  do  not  enter  into 
business  to  be  able  to make  cotton,  cloth,  clothes,  shoes,  for themselves,  but  that by 
making  these  things  for  the  pleasure  of  their  customers  they  may  get  cotton, 
clothes,  shoes,  bread,  meat,  etc.,  for  themselves.  If their  customers  desire  nothing 
they  get  nothing  themselves.  Mr. Mill  says:—"Having  the  labour  and  the  capital  if 
there  be  no  demand  for  one  thing  they  can  make  another."  Can  they?  The  velvet-
makers  have  been  engaged  in  velvet  making  from  their  very  childhood.  All  that  has 
fallen  to  their  share  in  the  shape  of  consumables  they  got  for  velvet  making,  but 
they  never  wore  any  themselves.  The  demand  stops.  The  ladies  have  taken  it  into 
their  heads  to  wear  cashmere  shawls  instead  of velvet  cloaks.  What  is  to  be  done? 
Transfer  the  capital  will  be  the  ready  reply  of political  economists.  But  the  capital, 
in  as  far as  it  consists  in tools  and  materials,  is  not transferable to  the  making  of the 
article  for which  there  is  a  demand  nor  the  acquired  skill  of the  labourer.  The  only 
thing  transferable  is  the  ready  money  that  may  be  in  the  possession  of their  employ 
ers,  but with this  they  assuredly will not  employ  their former hands,  the  velvet  mak 
ers,  and  the  only  possible  way  in  which  the  latter  can  produce  anything  to  supply 
their  own wants  is  by  making  velvet  for  the  pleasure  of other  people.  In  the  case  of 
there  being  no  demand  for  anything,  capitalists  and  labourers  setting  to  work  to 
produce  things  for  their  own  consumption,  this  is  such  a  preposterous  supposition 
that  one  can  hardly  take  it  as  serious.  The  idea  of the  cotton  millers  of Lancashire 
giving  their  capital  that  their  spinners  apd  weavers  might  produce  food,  shelter, 
shoes,  even  cotton  shirts  for  themselves.  Did  the  capitalists  of Lancashire  invest  a 
single  five  pound  note  by  way  of business  with  such  an  end  in  view  during  the  late 
crisis?  If half the  population  of London  were  going  naked  from  want  of clothes,  not 
a  yard  of  cloth  would  be  produced  to  cover  their  nakedness  by  way  of  business, 
unless  there  was  a well  founded  belief that  those  who  furnished  it would  be  paid  for 
it.  Capital  never  employs  labour  with  a  view  of  satisfying  wants  or  desires,  unless 
those  who  have  the  want  or  the  desire  are  also  willing  and  able  to  give  the  capitalist 
more  for  the  finished  product  than  he  gives  to  his  work-people.  Whatever  capitalist

VI.  Fixed  Capital—Its  Effect  u p on  Labour. 

All  contrivances  that  are  got  up  with  a  view  to  aid  or  promote  production,  and  are 
not rendered  useless  by being  used  once,  come  under the  head  of fixed capital.  It  is 
not  my  intention  to  treat  of  fixed  capital  generally,  but  only  of those  contrivances 
which  are  generally  termed  "improvements  of  production,"  and  which  enter  into 
immediate  competition  with  living  labour.

A working  man's  refutation  ...  VI.  Fixed  capital—Its  effect  upon  labour 

Mr. Mill  supposes  the  case  of a farmer who  employs  2,000 qrs.  of corn  per  annum 
in  maintaining  labourers  producing  2,400 qrs.,  altering  his  mind,  and  one  year  ex 
pending  1,000  qrs.  for  the  improvement  of land,  half the  labourers  would  be  thrown 
out  of employment  at  the  end  of the  year.  He  says: —"This  improvement  may,  with 
the  diminished  quantity  of labour,  produce  as  much  corn  as  before.  This  will  en 
able  the  farmer  to  become  a  larger  employer  of labour.  But  the  improvement  may 
only  produce  1,500 qrs.,  this  will  be  a  gain  of 25  per  cent.,  on  the  whole  capital  in 
stead  of 20  per  cent.,  but  permanent  injury  to  labourers."  That  an  improvement  in 
production,  which brings  grist  to  the  mill  of the  capitalist,  should  only  bring  starva-
tion  to  the  labourer,  is  rather  a  bold  supposition  and  Mr. Mill  amends  it by  saying, 
"Nevertheless,  I  do  not believe  that  as  things  are  actually  transacted,  improvements 
in  production  are  often,  if ever,  injurious,  even  temporarily,  to  the  labouring  classes 
in  the  aggregate."

This  is  simply  a  skuffle.  What  consolation  is  it  to  the  poor  wight  whose  labour 
15  has been rendered useless  by,  no  matter what,  improvement that others get  the  arti 
cle  he  used  to  produce  a  trifle  cheaper  if the  improvement  has  had  the  effect  of de 
priving  him  of the  means  of subsistence?  But  the  injury  does  not  stop  here.  If the 
labour  of  one  half  is  rendered  useless  that  of  the  other  half  becomes  depreciated, 
and  a  depreciation  in  any  one  branch  generally,  and  immediately,  affects  all 
20  kindred  branches;  but  an  improvement  in  the  direction  of  the  latter  portion  of 
Mr.  Mill's  supposition  would  not  only  have  the  effect  of  depreciating  labour,  it 
would,  by  diminishing  the  produce  also  enhance  its  price,  and  the  farmer's  gain 
would  be  everybody  else's  loss.  But  why  have  recourse  to  hypothetical  suppositions 
at  all?  Are  there  no  real,  heart-stirring—aye,  and  heart-rending  facts,  to  illustrate 
the  subjects?  Facts  that  admit no  equivocating  beliefs?  Is  it not  a  fact  that  in  conse 
quence  of the  improvement  in  agriculture  the  number  of labourers  is  as  steadily  di 
minishing  as  the  produce  is  increasing?  Is  the  increase  in  the  wages  of labour more 
than,  or  even  equal  to  the  depreciation  of gold  since  1851?

Facts  are  said  to  be  stubborn  things.  I  have  before  me  a  pamphlet—"Stubborn 
facts  from  the  factories,  by  a Manchester  Operative."  John  Ollivier,  Pall Mall,  Lon 
don,  1844,  from  which  I  will  give  a  few  extracts. 

The  raw  cotton  consumed  in  this  country  amounted  in  1781  to  5,198,7781bs;  in 
1841  it  amounted  to  528,000,0001bs;  in  1781  the  hand  loom  weaver  obtained  33s. 
3d.,  for  weaving  20  yards;  in  1841,  3s.  9d.  for  weaving  24  yards.  The  power  loom 
35  weavers  of  Sidebottom's  mill,  Waterside,  received  in  1823,  for  weaving  24  yards, 
21  picks  to  the  quarter inch,  2s.;  in  1841,  one  more  pick  to  the  quarter  Is.  Ashton's 
Mill,  Newton  Moor,  1825,  for 24  yards,  2s.  8d.;  1836,  ditto,  Is.  2d. 

The  spinners  received  in  1806,  for one  thousand  hanks,  forty  hanks  to the  pound, 
9s.  2d.;  in  1823,  6s.  3d.;  in  1832,  3s.  8d.;  and  in  1843,  from  Is.  lOd.  to  2s.  3d.;  and 
40  one  shilling  only  where  self-acting  mules  were  employed.  In  Houldsworth's  fine 
mill,  there  were  in  1829,127  spinners  and  83,376  spindles;  Thirty-five  of the  largest 
firms  employed  in  1829  one  thousand  spinners,  674,074  spindles;  in  1841  there 
were  but  487  spinners  working  736,128  spindles.  Thirty-six  coarse  firms  employed 
in  1829,  1,088  spinners;  1841  only  448,  working  53,353  spindles  more  than  the 
larger  number  in  1829.  Between  1835  and  1843  the  number  of spinners  employed 

45

ta 

Johann  Georg  Eccarius 

in  Stockport  dwindled  down  from  800  to  140.  A  fortunate  who  had  remained  in 
work,  stated  in  1843,  "In  1840  I  was  working  on  wheels  carrying  672  spindles,  and 
could  earn  11.  2s.  a  week.  I  now work upon  a  pair  of wheels  carrying  2,040  spindles 
and  earn  13s.  a  week."  This  is  more  than  doubling  the  productive  power. 

The Fustian cutters were paid  in  1827,  4d.  a yard;  1843,  l%d.  a yard;  women  and 

5 

children  employed. 

In  a  petition  to  Parliament  from  the  blockprinters  of Lancashire,  Cheshire,  and 
Derbyshire,  1842,  it  is  stated  that  10,000,000  pieces  were  printed  by  machines,  for 
which  the  printers  and  their  boys  would  have  received  1,125,0001;  the  wages  of 
those who  attended these  machines was  29,000/.,  and with this  improvement in pro-  10 
duction  children  from  7  to  9  years  old  had  to  work  from  16  to  18  hours  a  day. 

Perhaps  some  of my  readers  may  be  led  to  the  conclusion  that  the  machine  mak 
ers  must have  had  a jolly  time  of it,  let us  see;  I  give  in  full what is  said  on this  sub 
ject:—"Introduced  between  the  year  1838  and  1844  in  one  of  the  large  machine 
making  shops  of Manchester: 

15 

One  plaining  machine,  equal  to  fourteen  men  employs  one  man  or  boy  to  direct 

it.  Five  smaller  ones  equal  to  three  men  each,  employ  one  person  each. 
One  blotting  machine  equal  to  twelve  men,  one  person  directs  it. 
One  self-acting  lathe  equal  to  three  men,  with  one  person  to  superintend  it. 
One  nut-cutting  machine  equal  to  three  men,  employs  one  boy. 
One  wheel-cutting  machine,  equal  to  twenty  men,  employs  one  man. 
One  boring  machine,  equal  to  ten  men,  employs  one  person. 
In  another  shop  there  are  twenty  self-acting  lathes,  equal  to  one  hundred  men, 

20 

one  man  or  a  boy  attends  two  of them. 

Eight plaining  machines,  equal to  ninety-six men,  one  man  or  a  boy  attends  one  25 

of  them. 

One  nut-cutting,  upon  a  further  improved  principle,  equal  to  twenty  men,  em 

ploys  one  boy  only. 

One  slotting  machine,  equal  to  twenty  men,  one  man  or  boy  to  direct  it." 
Hardly  a  day  passes  without  some  political  wiseacre  talking  about  the  benefits  30 

conferred upon  the  working-classes  by  a rapid  increase  in  the  accumulation  of capi 
tal,  but  here  we  see  that  in  the very  branch  of industry,  the  name  of which  is  synon 
ymous  with  all  that  is  modern  in  production—all  that  is  typical  of  the  capitalist 
mode—the  accumulation  of capital  has  had  no  other  effect,  during  a  space  of  fifty 
years,  than  that  of displacing  labour,  and  depreciating what  was  not  displaced.  The  35 
man,  the  husband,  the  father,  the  natural  protector  and  provider  of the  family  was 
sent  home  from  the  factory  to  cook  and  mend  stockings,  and  the  wife  and  the  little 
children  had  to  take  his  place  in  the  mill  to  procure  him  food. 

Beliefs  do  not  easily  go  down  with  everybody  now-a-days,  and  it  requires  a  very 
credulous  person  indeed  to  believe  that  improvements  in  production  are  not  even  40 
temporarily injurious to  the labouring classes.  Did the hand loom weavers of 1841  stick 
to  their  trade  from  choice?  What  became  of those  who  were  turned  adrift?  The  au 
thor  says:—"Great  numbers  may  be  seen  about  the  streets  selling  salt;  gathering 
rags  and  bones;  sweeping  the  streets;  anything  that  may  offer the  least  apology  for  a 
livelihood."

A working  man's  refutation  ...  VII.  Fixed  capital—its  effect  upon  labour 

Thus  the  capitalist  mode  of production  is  at  best  a  social  war  in permanence,  im 
provement  of the  productive  power  going  about  like  a  roaring  lion  seeking  whom  it 
can  devour;  it  is  a cruel war,  all the  victory  and  the  shooting  is  on one side,  and  the 
being  shot  at  on  the  other;  it  is  a  detestable,  abominable  war,  engendered  by 
greed—undisguised greed—rendered  the  more  hateful because  the  accumulation  of 
wealth,  for the  sake  of accumulation,  is  held  up  as  an  ennobling  principle,  is  looked 
upon  by  its  votaries  as  a  divine  ordinance,  or  a  natural  law,  and  is  represented  as 
humane  and  beneficial  in  its  effects  upon  the  poor  by  apologetic  sophists  and 
mountebanks.  Those  who  perish  in  the  struggle  have  not  even  the  consolation  of 
falling  in  a good  cause  or  dying for  glory,  they  are void  of all fanaticism,  of illusion, 
and  delusion;  they  are  simply  victims  sacrificed  at  the  shrine  of  Plutus;  they  are 
conscious  of their  doom,  and  see  themselves  perish  inch  by  inch.

This  is one  of the burning  questions upon  which the  two  main  divisions of the  pop-
ulation,  that  constitute  modern  society,  will  never  come  to  an  agreement.  Those 
who  are  in  possession  of all  the  food,  the  clothing,  the  shelter,  and  the  implements 
and  materials  of  production,  consider  the  question  from  a  utilitarian,  those  who 
possess  nothing  but  the  requisite  ingenuity,  skill,  dexterity,  and  muscular  strength 
for  manual  operations,  from  a  humanitarian  point  of view.  A  reconciliation  of these 
stand-points  is  utterly  impossible,  and  conversion  is  out  of the  question.  A  writer 
in  the  Daily  Telegraph  said  the  other  day  that,  if such  men  as  George  Odger  were 
sent  into  the  House  of Commons,  their  erroneous  notions  on  questions  of political 
economy  would  melt  like  wax  before  the  fire,  before  the  eloquence  of  Mr.  Glad 
stone.  Vain  delusion!  This  is  only  the  conversion  of time  servers  and  place  hunters. 
It  is  not  a  matter of comprehension  but of social  position.  It  is  hardly  probable,  if it 
were  possible,  that  the  cottier,  who  is  under notice  to  quit,  to  make  room  for sheep, 
because wool  and  mutton  are  dear;  and  the  spinner,  whose  employer  is  about  to  in 
vest  his  previous  year's  income,  which  the  spinner  has  helped  to  produce,  in  self-
acting  machinery  to  supersede  manual  labour,  should  be  equally  convinced  of the 
advantages  of the  change  with  the  landlord  and  the  millowner.  The  representative 
spokesman  of an  aspiring  class,  or  an  advanced  party,  are  inconvertible.  From  the 
moment they  exhibit  signs  of softening  they  cease to  be  representative  leaders.  Had 
Richard  Cobden  and  John  Bright  softened  before  the  charms  of protectionist  elo 
quence  they  would  no  longer  have  been  the  spokesmen  of  the  industrial  middle-
class,  and would certainly  have been repudiated as turn  coats  and  deserters.  Others 
would  have  taken  their  places. 

In  a  rational  state  of society  the  cost  of production  of the  annual  produce  of the 
community  would  be  equal  to  the  amount  of labour required  to  produce  it.  But un 
der  existing  arrangements  this  is  not the  case.  The utilitarians,  the  owners  of all  the 
produce of labour, call that portion of the produce  which they have  to  expend  to ob 
tain  the  whole,  the  cost  of production.

If a  farmer  required  twenty  horses  for  the  ploughing  of his  land,  whatever  quan 
tity  of grain  and  hay  they  consumed  would  be  reckoned  as  cost  of production,  and 
he  would  consider  his  horses  very  useful  as  long  as  he  could  not  do  without  them. 
But  if,  by  some  mechanical  contrivance,  the  ploughs  were  so  much  improved  that 
they  could  be  worked  with  half the  horse-power,  ten  horses  would  become  useless; 
if,  by  a  further  improvement,  the  ploughs  could  be  worked  by  a  ten-horse  power 
steam  engine,  at  half the  expense  of the  keep  of the  ten  living  horses,  all the  horses 
would  become  useless.  These  improvements  might  tend  to  a  large  increase  of the 
produce  of the  farm,  larger than what would  be  required to  feed  all the  horses  as  be 
fore,  yet  if the  farmer  could  not  sell  them  all,  and  was  not  allowed  to  kill  them  or  10 
turn  them  adrift,  he  would  consider  himself  injured  if he  had  to  provide  food  for 
any  one  of them  until  it  died  a  natural  death,  though  the  work  of these  very  horses 
might  in  the  first  instance  have  furnished  the  means  to  purchase  the  improved  ma 
chinery.  This  is  precisely  the  utilitarian,  the  bourgeois  point  of view.  The  proprie 
tors  of all  the  wealth  are,  as  it  were,  morally  convinced  that  they  have  an  indisput-  15 
able  right  to  it,  and  consider  every  farthing  of expense,  besides  what  they  spend  for 
their  own  enjoyment,  as  a  waste  and  an  injury  unless  it  be  used  or used  up  in  the 
production  and  increase  of their wealth.  In  the  actual  state  of things  the  cost  of pro 
duction  consists  of the  quantity  of the  produce  of labour  that  is  necessary  to  keep  a 
certain  number  of  productive  agents  in  working  condition,  and  replacing  them  20 
when  they  are  worn  out.  There  is  no  difference  between  the  steam  engine,  the 
horse,  and  the  man.  The  engine  requires  fuel  and  water;  the  horse,  grain,  hay,  and 
water;  the man,  bread,  meat,  and drink,  to  keep  them  in working  condition;  all else 
is  luxury.  Mr.  Mill  says,  "as  much  of the  wages  of labour  as  exceeds  the  actual  nec 
essaries  of life  and  health  is  not  actually  applied  to  production,  but  to  the  unpro-  25 
ductive  consumption  of  productive  labourers,  indicating  a  fund  for  production 
sufficiently  ample  to  admit  of  habitually  diverting  a  part  of  it  to  a  mere  conven 
ience." 

Nor  is  there  any  difference  between  the  horse  and  the  man  respecting the  danger 

of becoming useless. 

30 

Dr. Ure,  one  of  the  greatest  panegyrists  of  the  factory  system  says:—"The  con 
stant  aim  and  tendency  of every  improvement  in  machinery  is  to  supersede  human 
labour altogether,  or to  diminish  its  cost,  by  substituting the  industry  of women  and 
children  for that  of men;  or  of ordinary  labourers  for  trained  artizans.  On  the  auto 
matic  plan,  skilled  labour  gets  progressively  superseded,  and  will  eventually  be  re-  35 
placed  by  mere  overlookers  of machines.  Mr. Anthony  Strutt,  of Belper  and  Milford. 
will  employ  no  man who  has  learned  his  craft;  but  in  contempt  of the  division  of la 
bour principle,  he  sets  a  plough boy  to  turn  a shaft  of several tons  weight,  and  never 
has  reason  to  repent  his  preference.  The  effect  of substituting  the  self-acting  mule 
for  the  common  mule,  is  to  discharge  the  greater  part  of the  men  spinners,  and  to  40 
retain  adolescents  and  children.  The  proprietor  of  a  factory  near  Stockport  states 
that  by  such  substitution,  he  would  save  50/.  a  week  in  wages,  in  consequence  of 
dispensing  with  nearly  forty  male  spinners."  (This  was  written  30  years  ago.) 

However loud  the  millowner may sing  on  Sunday  "No more  than  others  I  deserve 
but  God  has  given  me  more,"  he  would  be  exceedingly  shocked  if his  workpeople 

45 

730 

A working  man's  refutation  ...  VII.  The  cost of  production 

told  him  point  blank  on  Monday  morning  that  they  considered  themselves  entitled 
to  a  share  in  such  improvements. 

But  there  is  a  difference  between  those  horses  and  men  that  have  not yet  become 
useless.  As long  as  the  horse  is used  the useless  ones  do not deprive  him of his food, 
but  the  unemployed  men  deprive  the  employed  ones  of food  by  forcing  their  wages 
down  below  the  point  of subsistence.  Remember  the  Stockport  spinner  cited  in  my 
last.  There  is  another  difference  between  the  man  and  the  horse,  the  man  has  a  will 
of his  own.  Left  to  the  bourgeois  rule  of  supply  and  demand,  and  to  cope  single-
handed  with  the  capitalist,  the  labourer would  be  at  the mercy  of the  employer.  But, 
in  combination  with  his  fellow  workmen  he  can  exact  somewhat  better  terms.  The 
trades  unions  and  factory  laws  are  a  bitter  pill,  a  very  bitter  pill,  for  the  spokesman 
of the  capitalists  to  swallow,  but  there  is  no  help.  Thirty  years  ago  Dr. Ure  showed 
that  in  consequence  of trades  unions  and  factory  laws  the  English  millowners  had 
to  pay  l i s.  average  wages  for  69  hours  work  weekly,  while  in  France  the  factory 
hands  worked  from  72  to  84  hours  for  5s.  8d„  and  in  Bonn  in  Prussia,  94  hours  for 
2s.  6d.  A week  ago,  two  men,  who  have  visited  the  coal  and  iron  works  in  Belgium, 
enlarged  in  the  Times  upon  the  happiness  of the  Belgian  coal  and  iron  masters  who, 
owing  to  the  absence  of trades'  unions  and  factory  laws,  can  make  the  whole  fami 
lies  of their  operatives  work  more  hours  for  less  money  than  the  puddlers  in  the 
black  country  obtain  for  their  own  individual  labour.

However  willing  a  portion  of  the  aristocracy  is  to  impose  restrictions  upon  the 
mill-lords,  they  are  quite  as  utilitarian  in  their  own  sphere  as  landlords.  Not  long 
ago  a  noble  lord,  who  has  rendered  signal  service  to  the  factory  labourers,  endeav 
oured  to  prove  that  the  rustic  labourers  in  his  county  were  well  paid,  that  if  they 
25  were  good  boys  they  could,  by  a  series  of shifts  and  problematical  advantages  make 
14s.  a week.  The  Bishop  of Oxford,  and  one  of his  subordinates,  consider the  clergy, 
the  nobility,  and  the  gentry,  above  all  blame,  because  a  labourer  in  the  neighbour 
hood  of Windsor  Castle,  who  has  eleven  children,  has  never  earned  less  than  twelve 
shillings  a  week  and  sometimes  as  much  as  fifteen.  Because  the  agricultural  labour-
ers vegetate  and rear  children,  and  cultivate  on  an  average  28  acres of land each,  on 
twelve  shillings  a  week,  nobody,  in  the  opinion  of these  noble  lords,  has  any  busi 
ness  to  find  fault.  Lord  Dufferin,  an  Irish  landlord,  thinks  that  as  one  labourer  is 
enough  in  Great  Britain  for  every  28  acres  of  land,  Ireland  requires  no  more.  Ac 
cording  to  his  calculation  there  are  still  300,000  out  of  800,000  too  many,  i.e.  ac-
cording to the  English system  only  500,000  are  necessary to  do the work;  the  other 
300,000  are  useless  and  a  burden  upon  the  land,  he  advises  them  to  emigrate. 

30

that  before 

Mr. Arnold, of Manchester, wishes to retain this surplus population, because he is 
quite  sure 
long,  as  soon  as  raw  cotton  becomes  cheap,  some 
40,000  hands  will  be  required  in  the  cotton  mills.  Forty  thousand  seems  to  be  a 
sort  [of]  standard  want.  Dr.  Ure  calculated  in  1836,  that  the  steam  power  then  in 
course  of erection  would  require  45,000  hands.  There  was  a  great  demand  for  chil 
dren  at  that  time.  By  an  Act  of Parliament,  which  took  effect  on  the  1st  of March, 
1836,  children  under  twelve  years  of age  were  prohibited  from  working  longer  than 
48  hours a  week in cotton mills.  About  16,400  children under twelve years were  res-
cued by this Act from the  cotton mills.  It was  a  severe blow at a time when the  trade 

40 

45 

731 

ta 

Johann  Georg  Eccarius 

increased  at  an  unparalleled  rate,  and  when  millions  were  invested  in machinery  to 
enable  little  children  and  plough-boys  to  supersede  high  paid  and  skilled  workmen 
to  lower  the  cost  of production.  However,  the  Government  of the  day  took  compas 
sion  upon  the  mill-owners,  and  appointed  migration  agents  in  the  factory  districts, 
who  had  to  arrange  terms  with  the  employers  for  the  pauper  children  which  were 
sent  from  the  rural  districts  to  be  employed  in  the  mills.  In  a  circular  letter  to  the 
Clerks  of the  Boards  of Guardians,  dated  Somerset  House,  23rd  October,  1835,  it  is 
stated  "The  families  most  eligible  will  be  those  of widows  with  the  greatest  number 
of  grown  up  children.  In  cotton,  wool,  and  flax  mills,  the  manufacturers  prefer 
children  above  twelve  years  of  age,  as  not  interrupting  the  continuous  course  of  10 
daily  employment.  In  silk  mills  there  is  no  restriction,  and  in  such  factories  they 
are  generally preferred  at  eight years  and upwards."  During  the  spring  quarter  about 
a  hundred  families  migrated.  Some  were  engaged  for  three  years,  others  till  they 
should  complete  their  twentieth  year.  But  trade  getting  sick  this  migration  did  not 
attain any large dimensions.  The  45,000  hands were not required. The export of cot-  15 
ton  goods,  which  had  risen  from  20,513,586/.  in  1834,  to  24,632,058/.  in  1836,  fell 
in  1837  to  20,596,123/.

This  is the  way  in which the  utilitarians,  the  chiefs  of production  and the  proprie 
tors  of all  the  produce  of labour  manage  to  keep  the  cost  of production  low.  Lord 
Dufferin  is  as  consistent  in  endeavouring  to  rid  Ireland  of the  useless  labourers,  as  20 
Mr.Arnold  is  in  wishing  to  retain  a surplus.  The  cost of the  maintenance  of the  agri 
cultural  labourer  is  already  so  low  that  hardly  a  reduction  is  possible,  and  therefore 
a  surplus  is  a real burden.  It  is not so with  the factory workers.  They  still get  a little 
more  than  will  keep  skin  and  bone  together,  and  a  surplus  of hungry  applicants  for 
work,  will  in  an  emergency  either  enable  the  mill  owner  to  make  a  reduction,  or  25 
prevent  those  at  work  from  demanding  a  rise.

If Dr.Ure's  ideal  could  be  realised—if all  the  productive  labour  could  be  performed 
by  automatic  machines—the  cost  of production  would  be  reduced  to  the  cost  of the 
materials  required  for  the  making  of  the  machines;  all  social  and  political  strife  30 
would  be  at  an  end,  the  rich  would  enjoy  their  wealth  in  peace.  There  being  no 
longer  any  demand  for  human  labour—the  sole  condition  of  existence  of  the  la 
bouring  poor—the  working  population  would  be,  more  or  less,  gradually  improved 
out  of existence;  none  but  the  proprietors  of wealth  and  their menials  could  subsist. 
If the  improvement of the productive powers,  the  lowering  of the  cost of production,  35 
that has  taken place  in the  manufacture  of cotton  could  be  extended  to  all branches 
of  labour,  fewer  than  a  hundred  thousand  human  beings  would  have  to  be  main 
tained  to  produce  the  same  amount of wealth  as  is  now  produced by  ten  millions  of 
hired  wages  labourers.  Such  a  result  would  be  in  strict  accordance  with  our  estab 
lished  laws  and  usages,  and  the  inevitable  result  of the  much-vaunted  law  of sup-  40 
ply  and  demand.

A working  man's  refutation  ...  VIII.  The  cost  of production 

The  doctrine,  that  a  thing  is  worth what  it  will  fetch  in  the  market,  applied  to  la 
bour simply means,  that  the  value  of the  working  man's  life  ought to  be  determined 
by  the  very  same  rules  by  which  the  value  of the  lives  of horses,  the  existence  or 
non-existence  of horses  and  steam-engines,  is  determined.

Those  who  treat labour  as  a  commodity  cannot  have  the  remotest  idea that  there 
is  no  analogy  between  what  the  working  man  has  to  dispose  of and  the  commodity 
which  the  capitalist  has  to  sell.  What  the  capitalist  has  to  sell  is  a  finished  product, 
totally  dissevered  from  any  personal  consideration.  As  soon  as  he  has  pocketed the 
purchasing price,  it  does  not  concern him  when,  where,  and  how  the  thing  sold  is  to 
10  be  used.  A man  may buy  a  ship  to  convey  it  to  the  high  sea  for  the  purpose  of set 
ting  it  on fire to witness the  grand  spectacle  of a burning  ship,  or he  may use  it for  a 
voyage  to  the  Arctic  regions  or  to  circumnavigate  the  globe—it  does  not  concern 
the  ship-builder;  but  it  seriously  concerns  the  working  man  when,  where,  and  how 
his  labour  is  to  be  used.  The  working  man  has  nothing  to  sell.  What  he  has  to  dis-

15  pose  of is  not  a product,  a thing  separate  or separable  from his  own  individual  self, 
he  hires  out  his  capacity  to  perform  certain  manual  operations,  and  in  doing  so  he 
hires  himself out,  and,  with  certain  provisoes,  he  hands  his  own  self over  to  his  em 
ployer  for  the  whole  space  of  time  requisite  to  execute  the  labour  contracted  for. 
The  only  analogy  there  is  in  the  actual  state  of things  is,  that  both  the  commodity 
of the  capitalist and  the  labourer become useless  if no  one  has  any need  for it—that 
is,  if it will not fetch  a price  in the  market.  This, to  the working  man,  is  tantamount 
to  extinction. 

20 

If,  as the utilitarians maintain,  a man may  do what he  likes with his own,  then,  as 
long  as  the  pre-requisites  of production  are  private  property,  the  proprietors  have  an 
indisputable  right  to  substitute  the  steam-engine  for  the  living  horse  and  the  auto 
matic  spinner  and  weaver  for  the  living  man  spinner  and  weaver;  and,  if the  mill-
owner  has  the  right  to  substitute  the  engine  and  the  automaton  for  the  horse  and 
the  man,  every  other proprietor has the right to follow the  example;  and,  if the spin 
ner  and  the weaver  are  in  duty  bound  to  submit  and  make  their  exit,  then the  whole 
labouring  population  would  be  in  duty bound  to  submit  and make  their  exit  if their 
labour  were  no  longer  useful  to  the  possessors  of  wealth.  They  might  do  this  as 
cheerfully  as  the  maniacs  who  throw themselves  before  the wheels  of the  Car of Jug 
gernaut  if  they  would  only  look  upon  the  cost  of  production  from  the  proprietary 
point  of view,  and  learn  to  understand  that  the  law  of supply  and  demand  is  either 
an  immutable  law  of nature  or  a  Divine  ordinance. 

However,  the  possessors  of wealth  and  their  spokesmen  cannot help  being  tickled 
now  and  then  by  a  touch  of humanitarian  considerations,  but  they  easily get  over it 
by  not  believing  that  the  improvement  of the  productive  powers  injures  the  labour 
ing  poor  in  the  long  run.  Thomas  Ashton  stated  before  a  Parliamentary  committee 
in  1824:  "There  is  at  the  present  moment  a  gradual  transfer  of workmen  going  on 
from  handlooms  to  powerlooms;  this  transfer  of hands,  by  enabling  me  to  perform 
the  same  quantity  of work  with  much  fewer  hands,  does  not  throw  many  workmen 
out  of work.  Our trade  is  advancing  in  such  a  rapid  degree  as  to  absorb  the  number 
of hands  thus  thrown  out.  The  men  earn  from  twenty-four to  thirty  shillings  a  week 
clear  money  for  dressing.  The  weaving  is  done  by  boys  and  women."  Besides  the

Johann  Georg  Eccarius 

fact  that  it  would  have  required  a  sixfold  increase  of  weaving  to  place  the  super 
seded  handloom  weavers,  a  dressing  machine  was  soon  invented  by  which  one  boy 
could  do  the  work  of four men.  Professor  Venior—no  champion  of labour's  r i g h t s-
said  in  1830:  "Ever  since  the  introduction  of the  powerloom,  thousands  of  hand-
loom  weavers  have  been  pining  away  under  misery  not  alleviated  even  by  hope." 
Mr. Cowell,  a  factory  inspector,  gave  an  account of an  improvement  of two  mills  in 
Manchester.  The  mules,  containing  324  spindles,  and  spinning  161bs.  of  cotton 
(200  hanks  to  the  pound)  in  69  hours,  had  been  doubled.  One  man  worked 
648  spindles,  spinning  321bs.  earning  50s.  instead  of 41s.  as  before.  Mr. Cowell  for 
got  that  the  extra  nine  shillings  necessarily  deprived  another  man  of 41s.,  and  that 
it  could  only  last  until  the  improvement  became  general. 

5

At  that  very  time  Messrs.  Sharp  and  Roberts  stated,  among  the  advantages  of us 
ing  their  self-actors,  "the  saving  of a  spinner's  wages  to  each  pair  of mules,  and  in 
creased  production."  The  648  spindle  mule  was  soon  thrown  in  the  shade.  In  1835, 
Dr.  Ure  wrote:  "It  is  delightful  to  see  from  800  to  1,000  spindles  of  polished  steel  ad-  15 
vancing  and  receding.  One  spinner  manages  a  pair,  and  supersedes  the  labour  of 
one  or  two  companions."  To  his  own  query  whether  this  will  not  effect  a  reduction 
of wages  he  has  no  other  answer  but  that  he  is  certain  it  increases  the  wages  of 
children,  makes  the  spinners  civil  and  obedient,  and  gives  the  millowner  a  chance 
of selecting  the  best.  "The  men  displaced  might  find  employment  upon  the  power-  20 
looms  at  15s.  a week."  Thus  we  see  that  the value  of a  powerloom  situation  had  di 
minished  by  half  in  the  short  space  of  ten  years.  Inspector  Horner  reported  in 
Oct. 1843,  "hundreds  of men  between  twenty  and  thirty  years  of age,  in  full  vigour, 
are  employed  as  piecers  at  8s.  or  9s.  a  week,  while  children  of thirteen  receive  5s., 
and young women between  sixteen and twenty from  10s.  to  12s."  There  are none  so  25 
blind  and  deaf as  those  who  will neither  see  nor hear.  G.R.Porter,  the  late  secretary 
of the  Board  of Trade,  says  in  his  Progress  of the  Nation,  1851:  "Piecers  are  em 
ployed  in  the  proportion  of four to  one  spinner;  one  is  generally  a girl.  The  progress 
of trade  is  so  gigantic  that  the  boys  are  all  absorbed  as  spinners;  they  increase  in  a 
geometrical  ratio."  This  statement  proves  that  such  glowing  accounts  should,  at  all  30 
times,  be  received  with  great  caution,  if not  with  distrust. 

I  shall  now  give  a  few  facts  to  show  what  the  nineteenth  century  has  accom 
plished  in  the  shape  of reducing  the  cost  of production  and  increasing  the  produc 
tive  powers.  Dr. Ure  calculates  that  at  the  very  least  a  Hindoo  woman would  have  to 
work 500 days to  spin a pound of cotton into 250 hanks;  according to  a statement in  35 
a  little  book  published  by  the  Society  for  the  Diffusion  of Useful  Knowledge,  one 
horse-power  could  spin  as  much  as  1,066  persons,  proving  the  tendency  of modern 
civilisation  to  replace  1,066  human  beings  by  a  horse.  Hargreaves'  Jenny  enabled 
one  person  to  spin  from  16  to  20  threads  at  one  time;  Highs'  increased  it  to  more 
than  50;  Arkwright's  to  100,  and  introduced  horse-power  to  turn  the  machine.  40 
Crompton  invented  the  mule,  a  hybrid  between  the  Jenny  and  the  water-frame  with 
130  spindles;  this,  as  I  have  already  mentioned,  was  improved  to  a thousand.  Next 
came  the  reduction  of friction  and  accelerated  motion.  The  Throstle  required  one 
horse-power for  180  spindles,  the  mule  one  for  500  spindles.  Gore's  spindles  turned 
5,000  in  the  minute;  Axton's  7,000  times.  In  1823  one  spinner  with  336  spindles  45 

734 

A working  man's  refutation  ...  VIII.  The  cost of production 

could  turn  off 461bs.,  120  hanks  to  the  pound,  in  74¾  hours  per  week;  in  1833,  the 
same  number  of  spindles  52%lbs.  in  69  a  week.  In  1829  the  spinner  turned  off 
312  pounds  of yarn  in  the  same  time  that  he  turned  off  648  in  1835.  The  cotton

Kay's  fly  shuttle,  doubling  the  weaving  power,  was  introduced  1738.  About  the 
time  of the  introduction  of the  power  loom  a  good  handloom  weaver  could  weave 
two pieces of 24  yards  each,  in a week.  In  1823  a girl or boy  fifteen  years old attend 
ing  two  power  looms,  could  weave  seven  pieces  of equal  length;  in  1826  from  12  to 
15  pieces.  The  number  of power  looms  at  work  in  the  cotton  trade  in  Great  Britain

In  the  United  Kingdom  1835,  109,626;  in  1856,  299,000.  Cotton  cloth  exported 
per  loom  1835,  5,100  yards;  1856,  6,800  yards.  To  spin  the  cotton  consumed  in 
1859  on the  old  household  wheel would  require  more  than  60,000,000  persons;  half 
a million  men,  women,  and  children,  perform all  the  labour required.  In  1811  there 
20  were  35  out  of  every  hundred  engaged  in  agriculture;  in  1841  but  22.  The  total 
number  of  agricultural  labourers  in  1841  was  1,499,278;  in  1851,  1,347,387;  in 
1861,  1,340,000.  The  value  of the  mining  produce  was  9,000,000/.  in  1812.  In  1858 
it  amounted  to  31,266,932/.  In  1795  the  export  of  our  produce  and  manufactures 
was  27,312,338/.;  in  1865 
it  was  165,862,402/.  The  export  of  British  goods 
amounted  to  27,312,338/.;  in  1865  to  165,862,402/.  In  1842  the  income  charged 
with  income  tax  amounted  to  203,619,116/.;  in  1864  to  303,652,868/.  That  this  de 
velopment  of  the  productive  powers,  and  the  consequent  increase  of  wealth,  borders 
on  the  marvellous,  none  but  a madman  will  deny;  that with such productive  powers 
at  command  it  is  a  scandal  to  civilization  that the  hardest  working  population  that 
ever  existed,  or  any  portion  of them  should  even  be  exposed  to  the  possibility  of 
suffering  privations,  much  less  going  actually  short  of food,  not  even  a  Ure  can have 
the  hardihood  to  contradict.  The  working  man  maintains  that he  has  a natural right 
to  live whether his  existence  increases  the wealth  of the  rich or not;  he  is,  moreover, 
morally  convinced  that  all  the  improvements  of the  productive  powers  ought  to  be, 
and  at  no  very  distant  date  will  be,  the  common  inheritance  of the  human  species 
instead  of a  source  of  extermination  to  some  of the  most  valuable  sections.  These 
improvements  belong  to  no  class,  no  age,  no  country;  the  man  who  made  the  first 
wheel  has  as  great  a  share  in  the  most  improved  machine,  that  will  be  in  the  forth 
coming  Paris  exhibition,  as  the  maker  of it.  Had  he  not  found  the  wheel  and  other 
contrivances  ready  for  use  he  would  have  had  to  invent  them  before  he  could  go 
any  further.

IX.  Credit. 

The  Commonwealth. 
Nr. 204,  2. Februar  1867 

Before  I  proceed  with  the  present  subject,  I  must  apologise  for  the  blunders  in  my 
last.  Those  who  have  experienced  the  pleasure  of carrying  on  literary  pursuits  at  the 
family  fireside,  amidst  the  prattle  of the  non-literary  members,  will  probably  make 
some  allowance.  The  professor's  name  I  quoted  is  not  "Venior,"  but  Senior,  the 
celebrated  opponent  of factory  legislation  who  taught  political  economy  at  Oxford, 
at  the  time  when  some  of our  present  experienced  legislators  were  young  hopefuls 
at  college.  The  spirit  of his  teachings  may  be  gathered  from  the  following  specimen 
which  occurs  in  the  preface  to  lectures  on  the  wages  question  delivered  in 
1830:—"For  the  present  the  labourer  thinks  that  he  has  a  right  to  2s.  3d.  a  day  in  10 
winter,  and  2s.  6d.  in  summer.  Next year,  perhaps,  the  labourer  will  think  it  unjust 
that he  should  have  less  than 4s.  a day  in winter,  and  5s.  in  summer;  and woe  to  the 
tyrants  who  deny  him  his  right!" 

5 

"But  if they  are  allowed  to  fix  the  labour  they  are  to  give  and  the  wages  they  are 
to receive—if they  are to help  themselves,  while  it lasts,  from  the  whole  property  of  15 
the  country,  it  is  too  much  to  expect  that  they  will  not  prefer  idleness,  riot,  and 
plunder,  to  subsistence,  however  ample,  to  be  earned  by  toil  and  hardship."  Need 
we  wonder  that  poor  labouring  manhood  is  at  a  discount  in  high  quarters? 

The  half million  mentioned  in  connection  with  the  cotton  trade  applies  not  only 
to  spinning  but  to  all  the  branches  of labour  in  the  manufacture  of  cotton,  and  a  20 
further  improvement  of the  productive  powers  in  the  cotton  trade  is  included  in  the 
calculation  that  fewer  than  a  hundred  thousand  human  beings  could  produce  as 
much  as  ten  millions  do  now. 

Money-lending  for  a  consideration  is  probably  as  old  as  society  and  the  use  of  25 
money,  but  fortune-making  with  borrowed  money  is  of recent  origin.  In  olden  times 
it  was  only  people  who  could  not  make  both  ends  meet  in  their  household  affairs 
(the  hard-ups)  who  had  to  resort  to  borrowing;  hence  the  odium  attached  to  such  of 
the  rich  as would not  lend to  neighbours  in  distress  without  interest;  hence  the  ana 
themas  of the  Primitive  Church  against  usury.  A  great  change  has  come  over  the  30 
scene.  At  the  present  day,  borrowing  is  a  source  of gain  as  well as  lending.  In  times 
of  prosperity,  when  money  is  easy,  large  business  transactions  are  carried  on  by 
men who  have  very  little  property  of their  own,  many  of whom  make  fortunes,  and 
many  more  who  are  already  rich  extend  their  business  operations  by  the  aid  of 
credit,  and,  as  a rule,  the  opulent make  more use  of credit than the needy.  Mr. Mill,  35 
in  his  happy  versatility  of entertaining  two  opinions  upon  the  same  subject,  denies, 
under  the  head  of credit  as  a  substitute  for  money,  that  credit  creates  capital.  He 
says:—"As  a  specimen  of the  confused  notions  entertained  respecting  the  nature  of 
credit,  we  may  advert  to  the  exaggerated  language  so  often  used  respecting  its  na 
tional  importance.  Credit  has  a  great,  but  not  as  many  people  suppose,  a  magical,  40 

736 

A working  man's  refutation  ...  IX.  Credit

power;  it  cannot  create  something  out  of  nothing.  How  often  is  an  extension  of 
credit  talked  of as  equivalent  to  a  creation  of capital,  or  as  if credit  were  actually 
capital.  It  seems  strange  that there  should  be  any  need  to  point out that credit being 
only  permission  to  use  the  capital  of another person,  the  means  of production  can-
not  be  increased  by  it,  but  only  transferred.  If the  borrower's  means  of production 
and  of employing  labour  are  increased  by  the  credit  given  him,  the  lender's  are  so 
much  diminished.  The  same  sum  cannot  be  used  as  capital both  by  the  owner  and 
also  by  the  borrower  to  whom  it  is  lent;  it  cannot  supply  its  full  value  in  wages, 
tools,  and  materials  to  two  sets  of labourers  at  once."  One  might  almost  fancy  that 
10  under  credit  Mr. Mill  understood  borrowing  and  lending  between  two  sets  of per 
sons  engaged  in  the  same  branch  of business—the  borrowing  and  lending  that  fre 
quently  takes  place  among  little  farmers  and  tradesmen.  If farmer  Jones  borrow  a 
plough  of farmer  Brown,  it  is  evident  that  Brown  cannot use  the  plough while  Jones 
has  it.  But  this  borrowing  and  lending  is  not  credit,  and  does  not  come  within  the 

15  province  of political  economy. 

A plough is  not  a plough  at  every  stage  of its  existence.  When  it rests  in  the  ware 
house  of the  agricultural  implement  maker  it  is  merchandise,  the  product  of a  spe 
cific  kind  of  labour,  and  capable  of  being  used  in  the  operation  of  ploughing  as 
soon  as  it  leaves  its  resting  place—a  movement  that  will  take  place  whenever  its 
purchasing price,  or a security  equivalent to it,  is  offered  in exchange  for it. As long 
as  it  rests  in  the  warehouse  it  is  a  burden;  the  utmost  it  can  do  by  a  prolonged  stay 
is  to  harrow  up  its  possessor's  peace  of mind,  and,  perhaps,  induce  him  to  slacken 
his  production  and  discharge  some  of his  workpeople.  Now,  suppose  farmer  Brown 
wants  a  plough but has  no  cash  to  purchase  one.  If he  could  only  obtain  it  for  hard 
cash  he  would  have  to  do  without  it,  and  his  land  would  remain  barren;  but  his 
credit  is  good.  He  therefore  goes  to  the  manufacturer  and  buys  one,  and  the  manu 
facturer  draws  a  bill  on  the  transaction,  a  neighbouring  banker  discounts  it  with 
notes,  and  by  means  of these  notes  the  process  of ploughmaking  is  renewed.  Now, 
what  has  taken  place?  A  few  slips  of paper  in  the  form  of credit  have  released  the 
plough  from  the  place  where  it  was  likely  to  become  a  source  of  embarrassment, 
and  converted  it  into  food-producing  capital;  they  have  released  a  corresponding 
quantity  of the  raw  materials  and  tools  used  in  ploughmaking  from  a  similar  posi 
tion;  they have  given  a renewed  scope  to  productive  labour  and  enabled  the  capital 
ists  to  realise  their  interest  and  profit.  Whose  means  of production  are  diminished 
by  this  transaction?  Is  it  simply  a  transfer  of capital,  or  is  a  capital-creating  meta 
morphosis  beneficial  to  all  concerned? 

But  there  is  another  aspect  of  our  credit  system.  If  farmer  Brown  could  by  any 
contrivance  break  up  the  surface  of his  land,  at  a  trifling  expense,  equal  to  plough 
ing,  the  saving  of the  expense  of the  plough,  the  horses,  and the  ploughing  would  be 
tantamount  to  a  creation  of new  capital.  The  existing  paper  currency  has  exactly 
the  same  effect  compared  with  a  metallic  currency.  Had  the  United  States  been 
obliged  to  transact  all  their  business  with  gold  instead  of  paper,  they  would  have 
had to  part with  140,000,000/.  worth of produce  to  purchase  the  gold requisite  to re 
place  the paper in circulation in  1865.  By resorting to paper—i.e.,  credit,  they  saved 
(which  is  tantamount  to  creating)  a  capital  of equal  amount.  If our  paper  currency

had  to  be  replaced  by  gold  it  would  require  the  whole  amount  of one  year's  export 
of  British  and  Irish  produce  and  manufactures  to  purchase  it,  besides  an  annual 
wear  and  tear  of more  than  350,000/.  By using  paper  instead  of gold,  besides  the  fa 
cilities  it  affords  in  the  transaction  of  business,  we  save  the  whole  amount  which 
the  metal  would  cost  us. 

The  assertion  that  the  same  sum  cannot  supply  wages,  tools,  and  materials,  to 
two  sets  of labourers  at  once  is  contrary  to  established  facts,  and,  as  we  shall  pres 
ently  see,  contrary  to  Mr. Mill's  own  statement  under  another  head. 

Bifariousness  is  the  very  essence  of our  credit  system.  The  fourteen  millions  of 
sovereigns  advanced  to  Government  by  the  Bank  of England,  maintain  their  double 
existence  by  their  paper  images,  the  14,000,000/.  bank  notes. 

As  these  bank  notes  are  as  efficient  for  productive  purposes  as  their  equivalent 
value  in gold,  we  can  come  to  no  other conclusion than that  the  sum  of 14,000,000/. 
of  gold  may  in  combination  with  its  intrinsically  valueless  paper  images  be  made 
equal  to  a  productive  capital  of 28,000,000/.  Now,  as  all  our  credit  papers  are  sup 
posed  to  represent really  existing  wealth,  it  is  not  too  much  to  assert that  every  sum 
which  enters  the  charmed  circle  of credit  doubles  its  power.  Mr. Mill  states  this  fact 
under  the  head  of  influence  of  currency  on  foreign  trade.  He  supposes  that 
20,000,000/.  of gold  have  been  sent  abroad  and replaced  by paper.  The  effect  of this 
would  be  in  his  opinion: —"The  value  saved  to  the  community  by  dispensing  with 
metallic  money,  is  a  clear  gain  to  those  who  provide  the  substitute.  They  have  the 
use  of  twenty  millions  of  circulating  medium,  which  have  cost  them  only  the  ex 
pense  of an  engraver's  plate.  If they  employ  this  accession  to  their  fortunes  as  pro 
ductive  capital,  the  produce  of the  country is  increased  and  the  community  benefit 
ted,  as  much  as  by  any  other  capital  of  equal  amount.  When  paper  currency  is 
supplied  by  bankers,  the  amount  is  almost  wholly  turned  into  productive  capital.  A 
banker's  profession  being  that  of a  money  lender,  his  issue  of notes  is  a  simple  ex 
tension  of his  ordinary  occupation.  He  lends the  amount  to  farmers,  manufacturers, 
or dealers,  who  employ it  in their several  businesses.  So  employed it yields,  like  any 
other  capital,  wages  of labour,  and  profits  of stock.  ...  The  capital  itself in  the  long 
run  becomes  entirely wages,  and  when  replaced  by  the  sale  of the  produce becomes 
wages  again;  thus  affording  a  perpetual  fund  of the  value  of twenty  millions  for  the 
maintenance  of productive  labour,  and  increasing  the  annual  produce  of the  coun 
try  by  all  that  can  be  produced  through  the  means  of a  capital  of that  value."  And 
what  becomes  of  the  20,000,000/.  of gold  while  all  this  is  going  on?  The  sum  of 
20,000,000/.  of  intrinsic  value  supplies  by  the  aid  of  its  paper  images—credit, 
wages,  tools,  and  materials,  to  the  amount  of 20,000,000/.  to  each,  of two  sets  of la 
bourers  at  once.

Mr.  Mill  commences  his  chapter  on  profit  with  the  following  observation:—"The 
profits  of the  capitalist  are  properly,  according  to  Mr.  Senior's  well  chosen  expres 
sion,  the  remuneration  of abstinence."  It  would  be  an  equally  well  chosen  expres-
sion  to  say  that  rent  is  the  remuneration  of  land-owning.  In  my  second  article  I 
pointed  out what  difficulties  and  hardships  the  employers  of labour  have  to  endure 
to  carry  on  the  process  of accumulating  capital,  and  shall,  therefore,  leave  my  read 
ers  to  their  fate  respecting  the  conclusion  as  to  the  remuneration  of those  difficul 
ties and hardships.  But the next statement calls for enquiry.  Mr. Mill says:  "To popu-
lar  apprehensions  it  seems  as  if the  profits  of business  depended  upon  prices.  A 
producer  or  dealer  seems  to  obtain  his  profits  by  selling  his  commodity  for  more 
than  it  costs  him;  profit  altogether,  people  are  apt  to  think,  is  a  consequence  of pur 
chase  or  sale.  It  is  only  (they  suppose)  because  there  are  purchasers  for  a  commod 
ity,  that  the  producer  of it  is  able  to  make  any  profit.  The  cause  of profit  is,  that  la-
15  bour  produces  more  than  is  required  for  its  support.  The  reason  why  agricultural 
capital  yields  a  profit,  is  because  human  beings  can  grow  more  food  than  is  neces 
sary  to  feed  them while  it  is  being  grown.  Profit  arises,  not  from  the  incident  of ex 
change,  but  from  the  productive  power  of labour;  and  the  general  profit  of the  coun 
try  is  always  what  the  productive  power  of labour  makes  it,  whether  any  exchange 
20  takes  place  or  not.  If  there  were  no  divisions  of  employments,  there  would  be  no  buy 
ing  and  selling,  but  there  would  still  be  profit.  If  the  labourers  of the  country  pro 
duce 20 per  cent,  more  than their wages,  profits  will be  20  per cent.,  whatever prices 
may  or  may  not  be."  Before  we  go  any  further let  us  settle  what profit  means.  Profit 
is  a gain  resulting from  a  transaction  in  which  producer  and  consumer  are  different 
persons. To Crassus of ancient Rome,  and to Lytton Bulwer's  'Last of the Barons,'  a 
superabundant  harvest  would  have  been  a  real  gain;  the  former  could  have  given 
more  corn  to  the  poor  of  Rome,  the  latter  could  have  feasted  more  retainers;  to 
both  it would have  been  a  source  of power.  To  the  modern  farmer  and  landlord  it  is 
a  source  of misery.  To  the  ancient  patrician  and  the  feudal  baron  the  gain  arising 
out  of  production  consisted  in  the  quantitative  amount  of  consumables  they  ob 
tained;  to  the  modem  proprietor  it  consists  in  the  amount  of  money  that  can  be 
cleared.  The  water  works  of  ancient  Rome  were  a  great  benefit  to  the  people  of 
Rome,  but  they  were  no  source  of profit;  the  water  works  of the  New  River  Com 
pany  are  a  benefit  to  the  people  of London,  and  a  source  of profit  to  the  sharehold-
ers,  because  the water has  a  price;  it is  sold,  and  sold for more  than it  costs  to  pro 
cure  it.  Profit,  then,  is  a  gain  resulting  from  a  mode  of  production  under  which 
producers  and  consumers  are  two  different  sets  of persons,  who  have  to  buy  and  sell 
the  produce  of labour.

According  to  Adam  Smith,  rent  is  the  difference  between  the  market  price  of ag-
ricultural  produce  and  the  amount  of money  which  satisfies  the  farmer;  David  Ri 
cardo  has  explained  from  what  peculiar  circumstances  this  difference  arises.

Mr. Mill  has  adopted  his  theory,  but  does  not  perceive  that  profit  depends  as  much 
on  market  price  as  rent.  Leaving  rent  out  of  the  question,  what  constitutes  the 
farmer's  profit?  In  Mr. Mill's  opinion  the  difference  between  the  quantity  of food  a 
man  produces  and  that  which  is  necessary  to  feed  him while  he  is  producing  it;  in 
my  opinion  the  difference  between  the  price  of  labour  and  the  price  at  which  its 
produce  is  sold.  Whatever  this  difference  amounts  to  is  the  amount  of the  farmer's 
profit.  Let  us  suppose  a  young  community  of families  located  in  some  favoured  re 
gion  on  a  tract  of fertile  land  equally  divided  among  them.  They  are  contented  to 
live  on  the  fruits  of their  own  soil  and  labour;  every  family  produces  by  its  labour 
everything  required  for  its  subsistence.  If they  could  produce  a  hundred  times  as 
much  food  as  they  require  it would  be  of no use,  it would  be  labour in vain.  If,  after 
the  lapse  of  some  time,  another  community  settled  in  the  neighbourhood  on  a 
somewhat  poorer  soil,  but  with the  same  mode  of life,  it would  not  make  the  slight 
est  difference  in  the  social  arrangements  of the  original  settlers.  A  third  lot  might 
settle  on  a still poorer soil without  in  the least interfering with the  other two.  If 100, 
90,  80  represented  the  relative  fertility  of  the  three  different  soils,  the  labour  re 
quired  to  procure  a  subsistence  would  be  in  an  inverse  proportion  8,  9,10.  Suppose 
these  figures  to  represent  hours,  the  people  on  the  third  settlement  would  have  to 
work ten hours  to  obtain the  same  quantity  of consumables  as  the  people  in the  first 
could  obtain  in  eight.  No  improvement  in  the productive  powers  of either would  af-  20 
feet  the  condition  of  the  others.  If  the  people  of  No.  3  introduced  machinery,  by 
means  of  which  they  could  produce  as  much  in  two  hours  as  formerly  in  ten,  it 
would  make  the  people  of No.  1  neither  richer  nor  poorer  than  they  were  before. 
There  being  no  buying  and  selling  they  would  still  have  to  produce  all  they  re 
quired;  the  people  of  No.  3  would  produce  no  more  than  they  required.  Will  25 
Mr. Mill  point  out  in  what  direction  we  are  to  look  for  the  profit,  the  remuneration 
of abstinence  arising  out  of the  productive  power  of the  labour  of these  communi 
ties.

Let  us  now  turn  from  this  imaginary  state  of  things  to  the  existing  state  of  so 

ciety,  a state  of society  in which we  have to  deal with labourers who  can only gain  a  30 
subsistence  by  producing  things  which  supply  the  wants  of others,  and  where  they 
cannot  produce  for  the  wants  of  others  without  the  intermeddling  of  a  capitalist, 
who  exacts  a  profit.  Suppose  we  represent  the  productive  power  of labour  by  100, 
and  that,  at  that  rate,  the  quantity  of  a  given  product  is  exactly  equal  to  the  de 
mand,  its  market  price  will  be  equal  to  its  value.  If the  labouring  producer  is  also  35 
the  seller  there  will  be  neither profit  nor  loss.  If on  account  of scarcity  its  price  rise 
10  per  cent,  there  will  be  a  profit  of ten  per  cent.,  which  may  be  intercepted  by  a 
merchant.  If  the  labourer  consumed  his  own  product  there  would  never  be  any 
profit;  but  our  labourer  works  for  a  capitalist,  who  is  the  proprietor  of the  produce 
of his  labour,  and  let us  take  it for granted  that he  can  manage  to  live  on  70;  in  that  40 
case  the  profit  of the  capitalist  will  be  30.  Now  if Mr. Mill's  hypothesis  holds  good, 
if  profit  does  not  depend  on  buying  and  selling,  then  if  by  any  circumstance  the 
productive  power  of  labour  is  increased,  without  a  corresponding  increase  in  the 
rate  of wages,  the  profit  of the  capitalist  will  increase  in  a  corresponding  ratio.  Let 
us  go  a  step  farther.  Let  us  suppose  our  three  communities  as  having  entered  the  45 

740 

A working  man's  refutation  ...  X.  Profit 

5 

commercial  state,  and  let  us  apply  Ricardo's  rent  theory  to  profits.  During  the  pe 
riod  of transition  the  hours  of labour  have  been  equalised,  and  wages  are  uniformly 
at 70.  The first produces  100,  profit  30;  the  second  90,  profit 20;  the  third  80,  profit 
10;  total  270,  of which  210  are  paid  in  wages,  60  remain  as  profit.  If the  productive 
power  of labour  increased  by  40  per  cent,  the  proportions  would  be  140,  profit  70; 
126,  profit  56;  112,  profit  42,  total produce  378;  total profit  168.  If wages  were  paid 
in  kind,  and  the  capitalist  farmer,  like  the  patrician  and  baron  of old,  retained  the 
produce  for  the  use  of  his  own  household,  it  would  be  a  great  augmentation  of 
wealth;  but  the  produce  has  to  be  sold,  it  has  a  price,  and  its  value  is  estimated  in 
10  gold.  The  former  proportion  of  100  of  gold  for  100  of  produce  has  not  simply 
changed to  100 gold  and  140 produce,  but the  new proportion is  75  gold  to  140 pro 
duce.  Could  the  whole  of it  be  sold  it  would  realise  203  of gold;  but  180  of the  pro 
duce  is  dead  stock,  its  market price  is  a  fiction,  therefore  only  146  can  be  obtained. 
The  168  profit  from  production  is  converted  into  a  pecuniary  loss  of  64,  which 
15  means  bankruptcy,  and  ruin.  If the  farmers  of the  different  soils  sold  their  propor 
tionate  quantities they  would  respectively  realise  53,  47,  42;  their  respective  losses 
would  be  17,  23,  28.  If those  of No. 1  could  sell their whole  they would  still  clear  5; 
but  those  of No. 3,  would  lose  10.  With  a  reduction  of money  wages  those  of No. 1 
could  continue  their farming  operations,  and  even  extend  them,  without  any  rise  of 
prices,  but those  of No. 3  would  be  ruined.  So  much for profit being independent of 
prices. 

20 

Let  us  now  have  a  peep  at  historical  realities.  The  following  statements  are  taken 

from  "Tooke's  History  of Prices." 

"According  to  Sloane's  MSS.  a  fall  of  prices  occurred  between  1617  to  1621, 

25 

from  43s.  3d.  the  quarter  of eight  bushels  to  27s.

We  are  here  in  a  state  to  complain  of plenty;  but  so  it  is,  that  com  beareth  so  low  a 
price  that  tenants  and  farmers  are  very  backward  to  pay  their  rents,  and  in  many 
places  plead  disability;  for  remedy  whereof  the  council  have  written  letters  into 
every  shire,  and  some  say,  to  every  market-town,  to provide  a granary  or  storehouse, 
with  a  stock  to  buy  com  and  keep  it  for  a  dear  year.' 

The  following  was  written  at  the  same  period:—'England  was  never  generally  so 
poor  since  I  was  bom  as  it  is  at  this  present,  inasmuch  that  all  complain  they  can-
not receive their rents; yet  is there  plenty  of all things  but money, which  is  so  scant 
that  country  people  offer  com  and  cattle,  or  whatsoever  they  have  else,  in  lieu  of 
rent,  but  bring  no  money;  and  com  is  at  so  easy  rates  as  I  never  knew  it  to  be  at, 
twenty  or twenty-two  pence  a  bushel,  barley  at  nine  pence,  and  yet no  quantity  will 
be  taken  at  that  price.' " 

40 

45 

There  are  similar  complaints  at  subsequent  periods  of great  plenty.  During  the 
year  1731-32  and  33  wheat  averaged  22s.  In  a  publication  by  the  elder  Lord  Lyt-
tleton,  "Considerations  on  the  Present  State  of Affairs"  (1738),  he  says,  "In  most 
parts  of  England  gentlemen's  rents  are  so  ill  paid,  and  the  weight  of taxes  lies  so 
heavy  on them, that those  who have  nothing from the Court  can  scarce support  their 
families."

Let  us  now  see  whether  there  is  any  difference  in  the  fate  of the  farmer  and  that 
of  the  manufacturer.  In  1810,  the  importation  of  raw  cotton  was  136,488,9351bs. 
against  43,605,9821bs.  in  1808.  The  monthly  commercial  report  of the  1st  January, 
1811,  said,  "In  Lancashire  the  cotton  manufacturers  appear,  by  the  late  gazettes  as 
well  as  by  private  information,  to  be  greatly  distressed,  and  business  quite  at  a 
stand.  In  Manchester  and  other  places  houses  stop,  not  only  every  day,  but  every 
hour."  The  Chancellor  of the  Exchequer  stated  shortly  after  in  the  House  that  the 
large  manufacturers  had  diminished  the  number  of  their  workpeople  by  half,  the 
smaller  ones  had  discharged  theirs  altogether.  In  1825  the  consumption  of  cotton 
was 202,546,8631bs.  against  141,038,7431bs.  in  1824. November 4th,  1825,  a Boston 
paper  stated,  "Five  mercantile  firms  failed  at New York for 2,500,000  dois."  In  1825 
Georgia  cotton fetched  is.  6%d.,  at the  beginning  of 1826  it would  not  sell for  6%d. 
In  1845  business  was  increasing,  and  prices  advancing.  There  was  an  increase  of 
300,000  bales  against  '44;  on  the  18th  July,  1846,  the  Manchester  Guardian  stated, 
"Prices  are  unremunerative,  the  millers  consider  the  propriety  of  working  short 
time."  On  October  27th,  the  correspondent  of the  Economist  said,  "In  the  course  of 
a  fortnight  working  short  time  will  be  more  general  than  at  any  time  since  1825." 
Thus  we  see  that  when  the  surplus—Mr.  Mill's  profit—arising  out  of production  is 
largest,  the  possibility  of turning  it  to  account  is  smallest.  Paradox  as  it may  appear 
it  is,  nevertheless,  a fact,  that  in  any branch  of production,  when  the  produce  of la-  20 
bour  is  largest,  poverty  and  misery  are  stalking  about  in  its  ranks,  because  the  pro 
duce  has  a price,  a  price  which  often  falls  below  its  labour  value,  and  which  cannot 
be  realised  except  by  the  sale  of the  produce.  It  remains  to  be  proved  what  connec 
tion  there  is  between  industrial  profits  and  Ricardo's  rent  theory.  On  February 
11th,  1847,  the  correspondent  of the  Economist  said,  "The  difference  between  the  25 
price  of raw  cotton  and yarn  was  never so  small  as  at  present."  Feb.  11th,  39  in.  60 
reed  cloth  is  sold  at  8s.  a  piece,  a  ruinous  loss  to  manufacturers.  Georgia  cotton  at 
that time was from  5d.  to  8d.  a pound. In  1851,  a year of prosperity,  the  same  cotton 
was  sold for 7%d.  in  January,  and for  5%d.  in July.  The  same cloth sold for  9s.  7%d. 
in January,  and for 7s.  9d.  in  July.  The highest price up to  1858 was  8s.  6d.  How did  30 
8s.  become  a  remunerative  price?  By  increasing  the  fertility  of the  instruments  of 
production.  The  prices  that  ruled  previously  to  the  crisis  of 1846  and  1847  were  suf 
ficiently  remunerative  to  keep  the  old  machines  at  work,  which  carried  only  from 
five  to  six  hundred  spindles,  required  six  persons  to  every  horse  power,  and  from  8 
to  121bs.  of coal  per  hour  per  horse  power.  The  improved  machines  carried  a  thou- 
sand  spindles,  required  only  four  persons  per  horse  power,  and  only  from  3½  to 
41bs.  of coal per hour per horse  power.  The  new machines  could  produce  cotton  at  a 
profit,  for  8s.  a piece,  the  old  ones  could  not.  The  proprietors  of the  fertile machines 
are  in  the  same  position  as  the  farmers  on  the  fertile  soil,  when  corn  fell  to  75s.  and 
the  proprietors  of the  old  ones  shared  the  fate  of the  farmers  on  the  third  soil,  they 
had  to  give  it  up.  The  cause  of profit,  then,  is  not  the  difference  between  the  pro 
ductiveness  of labour  and  what  the  labourer  can  live  on.  When  labour  can  be  hired 
at  a  price  which  is  below  the  market  price  of the  produce  of  labour,  then  the  em 
ployer  makes  a  profit;  but  the  produce  must  be  sold  to  realise  that  profit.

Hitherto  I  have  dealt  with  theoretical  elucidations  and  conclusions,  and  negative 
criticism.  I  now  enter upon,  what  is  commonly  called  the  practical part,  the  consid 
eration  of positive  propositions.  The  measures  and  means  by  which  Mr. Mill  hopes 
to  cure  the  ills  that  afflict  us,  we  shall  find  as  unsuitable  and  impracticable  as  we 
found  his  theoretical  conclusions  erroneous  and  contradictory.  Instead  of discover 
ing  a  tendency  to progressive  development,  instead  of propositions  aiming  at  the  re 
generation  of society,  we  shall  find  them  obstructive  and  reactionary,  with  a  delib 
erate  aim  towards  the  attainment  of  the  stationary  state.  If  anyone  advocated  the 
old hand-wheel against the  modern mule,  the handloom against the powerloom,  the 
stage-coach  against  the  railway,  he  would  be  looked  upon  as  one  labouring  under 
an  aberration  of mind.  Now  small  farming  stands  in  the  same  relation  to  modern 
farming  on  a  large  scale,  as  hand  spinning  and  weaving  to  modern  machine  spin 
ning  and  weaving.  If in  former  times  a  man  had  been  in  possession  of a  thousand 
15  wheels  it would  have  required  a thousand  pairs  of feet  and  hands  to work them, just 
as  if  a  thousand  persons  had  possessed  a  wheel  each  and  worked  it  in  their  own 
homes.  In the  same  way  a ten  thousand  acre  estate was  cultivated  in  the  same  man 
ner  as  a  ten  acre  farm,  there  was  no  difference  in  the  mode  of operations,  the  same 
amount  of manual  labour  per  acre  being  required  on  large  farms  as  on  small  ones. 
Small farming  is  the mode  of cultivation  of the  past,  it  belongs  to,  and  is  conform 
able  to  a  state  of society  in  which  almost  every  household,  every  village,  every  prov 
ince,  produces  all  its  own  necessaries.  It  belongs  to  a  state  of  society  in  which  the 
great bulk of the  population  is,  as  it were,  rivetted to  the  soil,  and  in which there  are 
few  or  no  chances  of getting  a  living  except by  the  cultivation  of the  soil.  The  char-
acteristic  distinction  between  the  small  working  farmer  and  the  large  capitalist 
farmer  is,  that  the  former  produces  food  for  the  consumption  of his  own  family,  the 
latter  produces  food  for  the  market  for  the  consumption  of others.  The  large  farmer 
is  the  food  producer for an industrial community, the  small farmer the  food produc 
er  for  himself.  Mr. Mill  advocates  small  farming,  but  not  to  the  extent  of breaking 
up  the  existing large  farms,  he  only  proposes  that  "all  common  land  to  be  brought 
into  cultivation  should  be  devoted  to  raising  up  a  .class  of  small  proprietors."  To 
show what  a  happy  fellow  the  peasant proprietor  is  Mr. Mill favours  his  readers  with 
some  French  extracts  from  Sismondi,  of which  I  translate  the  following  choice  mor 
sel:—"The  peasant  who,  with  his  children,  does  all  the  work  on  his  little  inherit-
ance,  who pays no rent  to  any one  above him nor wages  to  any  one  below him;  who 
eats  his  own  grain,  drinks  his  own  wine,  clothes  himself with  his  own  hemp  and 
wool,  troubles  himself little  about  market  prices,  for he  has  little  to  sell  and  little  to 
buy,  and  is  never  mined  by  commercial  convulsions.  Far  from  fearing  the  future  he 
sees  it  embellishing  his  hopes;  for he  puts  every moment that  is  not  required  for his 
annual  labour  to  the  profit  of  his  offspring  for  centuries  to  come.  ...  He  is  also 
eager  to  buy  land  at  any  price.  He  pays  more  for  it  than  it  is  worth,  more  perhaps 
than  it  will  return  to  him."  We  see  at  the  first  glance  that  there  is  no  room  for  such

a  man  in  a  country  that  boasts  of such  places  as  London,  Liverpool,  and  Manches 
ter.  For if he  wants  to  be  truly happy  he will trouble  himself as  little  about  the  hun 
gry  mouths  in  London,  Liverpool,  and  Manchester  as  he  troubles  himself  about 
market prices.  If money  entice  him  to  produce  ought  else  than  what  he  requires  for 
feeding  and  clothing  his  family,  he  will  not  be  able  to  furnish  it  at  a  reasonable 
price,  since  he  pays  more  for his  land than it  is worth,  and  on that very  account,  be 
sides  enhancing  the price  of his produce,  necessarily  cripples  his  circulating  capital. 
If  such  happy  beings  still  existed  when  Sismondi  wrote,  I  can  assure  my  readers 
that  they  have  become  extinct,  since  the  necessity  of  money  making,  and  conse 
quently  the  indispensability  of caring  about  market  prices  has  even  penetrated  the 
Alpine  regions.  The  proposal  of Karl  Bürkli,  of Zurich  (one  of the  delegates  of the 
International  Congress  at  Geneva),  to  establish  a  people's  bank  for  the  Canton  of 
Zurich,  to  enable  the  peasantry  to  obtain  loans  for  less  than  from  5  to  10  per  cent, 
interest  is  a  striking  proof of this.  But  independent  of this  Mr. Mill  himself cites  evi 
dence which  shows  that  "the  indebtedness of the  proprietors  in the  flourishing  can- 
ton  of Zurich  borders  on  the  incredible,  so  that  only  the  intensest  industry,  frugal 
ity,  temperance,  and  complete  freedom  of  commerce  enable  them  to  stand  their 
ground."  But  the  peasantry  of Zurich  enjoy  an  advantage  which,  with  the  exception 
of  Florentine  straw-plaiters,  no  peasantry  in  the  world  enjoys.  Mr. Mill  states  in  a 
foot-note  that  "four-fifths  of  the  manufacturers  of  the  canton  of  Zurich  are  small 
farmers.  The  cotton manufacture  occupies,  either wholly or partially,  23,000  people, 
nearly  a  tenth  of  the  population."  In  the  canton  of  Schaffhausen  almost  all  the 
landed  properties  are  mortgaged,  but  rarely  for  more  than  half their  registered  val 
ue.  And  what  is  the  condition  of the  French  peasantry?  M.  de  Veauce  stated  last 
year  in  the  Chamber  of Deputies  that  "according  to  the  census  of  1851  the  mort-  25 
gages  on  land  amounted  to  400,000,000/.  sterling.  Things  had  become  considerably 
worse  for the  Government would  not publish the  returns  of 1861."  He  observed that 
"if a  large  estate  were  for  sale  in  the  neighbourhood  of a  large  populated  centre,  it 
could  be  divided  into  fragments,  each  of which  fetched  a  high  price—but  what  hap 
pened?  To  buy  a  mere  slip  of land  men  actually borrowed  the  double  of their  avail- 
able  capital,  looking  forward  to  the  future  to  clear  off their  debt.  Of the  7,846,000 
landed  proprietors  in  France,  not  less  than  3,000,000  had  been  certified  by  the  mu 
nicipal  councils  of their  communes  as  being  in  such  a  state  of absolute  destitution 
that  they  could  pay  no  personal  tax."  But  the  buying  of land  with borrowed  money 
is  not  the  only  way  in  which  the  land  is  mortgaged.  Suppose  a  man  leaves  at  his  35 
death  nine  acres  of  land,  free  of  debt,  and  three  children,  and  that  the  children 
agree  not  to  claim  their  three  acres  each,  what  happens  then?  Well,  the  one  who 
keeps  the  lot  must  pay  the  difference  to  the  other  two.  And  where  does  he  get  the 
money?  He  mortgages  the  property,  and  instead  of starting  in  business  with  a  fund 
in hand,  he  starts  with  a  crushing  weight  of debt,  of which he  can  never rid  himself. 
This  and  the  taxes  imposed  by  the  State  form  the  links  which  chain  the  peasant  to 
society,  and  implicate  him  in  the  fate  of the  community.  But  for  these  he  might  be 
the  happy  man  portrayed  by  Sismondi,  but  interest  and  taxes  compel  him  to  sell 
part  of his  produce,  at  all  hazards,  and  generally  the  best  part,  leaving  the  coarsest 
for  himself,  and  frequently  not  enough  of that.

A working  man's  refutation  ...  XI.  Small  farming 

The  life  of the  peasant  is  anything  but  an  enviable  one.  Speaking  of the  neigh 
bourhood  of  Zurich  Mr. Mill  says,  "When  I  used  to  open  my  casement,  between 
four  and  five  in  the  morning,  I  saw  the  labourer  in  the  fields;  and  when  I  returned 
from  an  evening  walk,  long  after  sunset,  there was  the  labourer  mowing  his  grass  or 
tying  up  his  vines." 

5 

Howitt says  about the Germans,  "They labour busily,  early and late,  because they 
feel that  they  are  labouring  for themselves.  They  plod  on  from  day  to  day,  from year 
to  year,  the  most  patient,  untirable,  and  persevering  of animals." 

10 

And  how  does  the  peasantry  fare?  Mr. Mill  says,  "No  peasantry  on  the  Continent 
has  the  superstition  of  the  English  labourer  respecting  white  bread."  The  Tuscan 
peasant,  according  to  Sismondi,  has  but  two  meals  a  day  in  the  bad  season,  "at  ten 
o'clock  in  the  morning  he  eats  his  porridge,  at nightfall he  has  soup,  and  afterwards 
he  has  bread  with  some  seasoning.  In  summer  he  has  three  meals,  at  eight,  at  one, 
and  in the  evening;  but he  only lights the  fire  once  a  day,  for his  dinner,  consisting 
15  of soup,  afterwards a mess,  or salt meat,  or dried  fish,  or beans,  or vegetables,  which 
he  eats  with  bread.  Salt  meat  enters  but  in  a  very  small  quantity  into  his  ordinary, 
for  he  reckons  only  401bs.  of salt  pork  a  year  as  an  ample  provision  per head;  twice 
a  week  he  puts  a  little  bit  into  his  pottage.  Sundays  he  always  has  fresh  meat,  but 
not  more  than  a  pound  or  a  pound  and  a  half,  however  numerous  the  family  may 
20  be."  The  Flemish  farmers  and  labourers,  says  Mr. Mill,  "live  much more  economi 
cally  than  the  same  class  in  England,  they  seldom  eat meat,  except  on  Sundays  and 
in  harvest;  buttermilk  and  potatoes  with brown  bread  is  their  daily  food."  Mr. Mill 
says  further,  "The  peasant  proprietors  are  oftener  accused  of penuriousness  than  of 
prodigality.  They  deny  themselves  reasonable  indulgences,  and  live  wretchedly  in 
order  to  economize.  In  France,  among  those  who,  from  the  hovels  in  which  they 
live,  and  the  herbs  and  roots which  constitute  their  diet,  are  mistaken  by  travellers 
for  proofs  and  specimens  of  general  indigence,  are  numbers  who  have  hoards  in 
leathern  bags,  consisting  of  five-franc  pieces,  which  they  keep  by  them  perhaps  a 
whole  generation,  unless  brought  out  to  be  expended  in  their most  cherished  grati-
fication—the  purchase  of land." 

30 

25 

It  is  admitted  that the  price  of land  is  far  above  its  value,  in  Belgium  it pays  little 
more  than  two  per  cent.  Now,  if  a  man  does  live  wretchedly  all  his  life  to  buy  a 
piece  of land,  what  does  it  amount  to?  If he  saves  1,000  francs,  and  buys  a piece  of 
land  for 2,000  francs,  he  will  get  possession  of a property,  worth perhaps  50  francs  a 
35  year.  As he had  to  borrow  1,000 francs  to pay  for his  land,  and  as  the  money  lenders 
hardly  ever  lend  for  less  than five per  cent.,  he  has  to  pay  50  francs  a  year,  his  own 
thousand  francs  bring  in  as  little  as  the  deposit  which  some  of the  slop  tailors  have 
to leave  with their  employers. The  peasant therefore  only  works  hard and lives  hard, 
and  buys  land  that  the  mortgagee  may realise  interest on  his  money.  Mr. Mill main-
tains  that  small  farming  produces  more  per  acre  than  large  farming;  but  Moreau  de 
Jonnès,  in  his  comparison  of England  and  France,  arrives  at  a  different  result.  Ac 
cording  to  his  calculations  in  1850,  the  annual  value  of  the  agricultural  produce 
was:

Mr. Mill  says,  "Large  capital  applied  to  farming  is,  of course,  only  applied  to  the 
very  best  of  the  soils  of  a  country.  It  cannot  touch  the  small  unproductive  spots, 
which  require  more  time  and  labour  to  fertilize  them  than  is  consistent  with  a 
quick return  of capital."  Now,  I  ask  whether  it  would be  good  economy  in  a  state  of 
society  that boasts  of the  steam plough to  condemn  any  set of men to  cultivate  land 
by  superhuman  industry;  poor  land—perhaps  with  the  spade,  as  in  the  Wales  dis 
trict—that  they  may  subsist  on  buttermilk,  potatoes,  and  brown  bread.  Yet  this  is 
what  Mr. Mill  proposes  to  ameliorate  the  wretched  condition  of the  agricultural  la 
bourers.  If by  any  economical  arrangement  a  given product  can  be  produced  by  less 
labour  than  by  any  other,  it  is  rank  folly,  and  contrary  to  all  sound  economy  to  15 
adopt  that  which  requires  most.  If  the  reduction  of manual  labour  is  injurious  to 
the  poor,  that  is  not  the  fault  of the  mode  of production,  but  of the  mode  of distri 
bution,  and  it is the business  of those who  suffer to  alter it.  The  small farm system is 
condemned,  socially  and  economically.  No  working  men  of sound  mind  will  con 
sider  the  mode  of  living  portrayed  by  Sismondi  and  Mr. Mill,  combined  with  the  20 
hardships  attending  it,  as  an  improvement  compared  with  the  condition  of the  Brit 
ish  day  labourer.  But  more  than  that,  the  continental  peasantry  turn  up  their  little 
farms  and  emigrate.  The  Germans  go wholesale  to  America,  the  French flock to  the 
towns,  the  rural population  diminishes,  and there  is  a movement going  on  of substi 
tuting  large  farming  for  small  farming. 

25 

But,  there  is  another  aspect  of the  question.  It  is  now  admitted  on  all  sides  that 
co-operation  offers  the  only  means  for  a  solution  of  the  labour  question.  Just  as 
combined  and  concentrated labour  is  a  superior mode  of production  to  isolated  and 
scattered  labour,  so  co-operative  labour  is  superior  to  the  present  mode  of produc 
tion,  and  must  sooner  or  later  supersede  it.  Co-operative  labour  is  the  peculiar  30 
child,  the  natural  offspring  of factory  industry  and  large  farming;  co-operation  re 
quires  a  preliminary  course  of industrial  training,  and  this  is  the  secret  why  co-op 
eration  succeeds  better  in  Manchester  than  in  London.  What  the  London  mechanic 
will  do  some  day  from  moral  conviction  the  factory  labourer  does  almost  from 
habit.  The  day  labourer  on  the  large  farm  has  had  a  considerable  amount  of such  35 
training,  he  is  fît  to  enter  upon  co-operative  farming,  the  small  farmer  who  is 
guided by his own whims  and caprices is not.  To break up the large estates and estab 
lish  small  farming  to  any  extent  would  be,  to  say  the  least,  absolutely  obstructing 
the  progressive  development  of agriculture.  The  working  classes  have  a  direct  inter 
est  to  oppose  every  attempt  that  may  be  made  in  this  direction.  Instead  of convert-  40 
ing  waste  and  common  lands  into  small  farms  the  Legislature  ought  to  facilitate 
their transfer as  well  as  that  of the  Crown  and  Church  lands  to  co-operative  associa 
tions,  not  as  permanent  property  but  on  lease,  since  no  private  individuals,  nor 

746 

A  working  man's  refutation  ...  XII.  Property 

companies  with  interests  separate  from  the  common  interests  of the  people,  ought 
to  be  invested  with  the  perpetual  control  and  direction  of the  use  of the  land—the 
source  of food.

5  Mr.  Mill  says,—"If  choice  were  to  be  made  between  communism  with  all  its 
chances,  and  the  present  state  of society  with  all  its  sufferings  and  injustices;  if the 
institution  of private  property  necessarily  carried  with  it  as  a  consequence,  that  the 
produce  of labour  should  be  apportioned,  as  we  now  see  it,  almost  in  an  inverse  ra 
tio  to  the  labour—the  largest portions  to  those  who  never work  at  all,  the  next  larg-
est  to  those  whose  work  is  almost  nominal,  and  so,  in  a  descending  scale,  the  re 
muneration  dwindling  as  the  work  grows  harder  and  more  disagreeable,  until  the 
most  fatiguing  and  exhausting  bodily  labour  cannot  count  with  certainty  on  being 
able  to  earn  even  the  necessaries  of life;  if this,  or  communism were  the  alternative, 
all  the  difficulties,  great  or  small,  of communism  would  be  as  dust  in  the  balance. 
15  But  to  make  the  comparison  applicable,  we  must  compare  communism  at  its  best, 
with  the  regime  of individual  property,  not  as  it  is,  but  as  it  might  be  made.  The 
principle  of private  property  has  never yet  had  a  fair  trial in  any  country.  The  social 
arrangements  of modern  Europe  commenced  from  a  distribution  of property  which 
was  the  result,  not  of just  partition  or  acquisition  by  industry,  but  of conquest  and 

20  violence. 

Individuals  need  not  be  chained  to  an  occupation  or  to  a partial  locality.  The  re 
straints  of communism would  be  freedom  in  comparison  with  the  present  condition 
of  the  majority  of  the  human  race.  The  generality  of  labourers  in  this  and  most 
other  countries  have  as  little  choice  of  occupation,  or  freedom  of locomotion,  are 
practically  as  dependent  on  fixed  rules  and  on  the  will  of others  as  they  would  be 
on  any  system  short  of actual  slavery. 

25 

The  institution  of property,  when  limited  to  its  essential  elements,  consists  in  the 
recognition  in  each  person  of  a  right  to  the  exclusive  disposal  of what  he  or  she 
have  produced  by  their  own  exertions,  or  received  either  by  gift  or  by  fair  agree-

30  ment,  without  force  or  fraud,  from  those  who  produced  it. 

Nothing  ought  to  be  treated  as  property  which  has  been  acquired  by  force  or 

fraud. 

When  the  'sacredness  of property'  is  talked  of,  it  should  always  be  remembered, 
that  any  such  sacredness  does not belong  in  the  same  degree  to  landed  property.  No 
35  man made  the  land.  It  is the  original inheritance  of the whole  species.  Its  appropri 

ation  is  wholly  a  question  of general  expediency.  When  private  property  in  land  is 
not  expedient,  it is  unjust.  The  State  is  at liberty  to  deal with  landed  property  as  the 
general interests  of the  community may require,  even  to  the  extent,  if it so  happens, 
of doing  with  the  whole  what  is  done  with  a  part whenever  a  bill  is  passed  for a  rail-
road  or  a  new  street.  The  community  has  too  much  at  stake  in  the  proper  cultiva 
tion  of  the  land,  and  in  the  conditions  annexed  to  the  occupancy  of  it,  to  leave 

40 

747 

Johann  Georg  Eccarius 

these  things  to  the  discretion  of a  class  of persons  called  landlords,  when  they  have 
shown  themselves  unfit for  the  trust.  To  me  it  seems  almost  an  axiom  that  property 
in  land  should  be  interpreted  strictly,  and  the  balance  in  all  cases  of doubt  should 
incline  against  the  proprietors.  The  reverse  is  the  case  with  property  in  moveables, 
and  in  all  things  being  the  product  of labour;  over  these  the  owner's  power  should 
be  absolute,  except  where  positive  evil  to  others  would  result  from  it;  but  in  the 
case  of land,  no  exclusive  right  should  be  permitted  to  any  individual which  cannot 
be  shown  to  be  productive  of positive  good.  To  be  allowed  any  exclusive  right  at  all 
over  a  portion  of the  common  inheritance,  while  there  are  others  who  have  no  por 
tion,  is  already  a  questionable  privilege.  No  quantity  of moveable  goods  which  a 
person  can  acquire  by  his  labour  prevents  others  from  acquiring  the  same  by  the 
same  means;  but  from the  very  nature  of the  case,  whoever  owns  land,  keeps  others 
out  of the  enjoyment  of it."

The  reddest  of red  communists  could  not  draw  a  truer,  a  more  abhorrent,  and  a 
more  strikingly  contrasting  picture  of the  social  position  of  the  working  man  and 
the  proprietor,  who  appropriates  the  fruits  of the  working  man's  toil,  than  Mr. Mill 
does;  but he  contends that  this  abominable  state  of society  is  not  a necessary  conse 
quence  of the  institution  of private  property,  and  bids  us  not  to judge  the  regime  of 
individual  property  as  it is,  but  as  it might be  made.  But what he  proposes  to  eradi 
cate this  abomination  is only  a modification of the laws of inheritance which might 
have  the  effect  of  substituting,  in  some  instances,  an  exacting  and  clever  trickster 
for  a  generous  simpleton  as  inheritor  of a  fortune,  or  it  might  break  an  annual  in 
come  of a  hundred  thousand  in  two  of fifty thousand  each.  Would  this  in  any  way 
whatever  alter  the  relation  between  capital  and  labour?  No!  emphatically,  no!  It 
would  be  an  obstruction,  and  aggravate  the  case.  If all  the  provisions,  all  the  raw  25 
materials,  and  all  the  instruments  of production  requisite  to  set  all the  productive 
labour  in  motion,  were  the  private  property  of  half  a  dozen  individuals,  a  parlia 
mentary  decree  of  expropriation  would  be  sufficient  to  convert  all  the  establish 
ments  of production  into  co-operative  concerns.  Every  invention,  every  fluctuation 
that  tends  to  the  concentration  of the  instruments  of production  in  the  hands  of a 
few,  is  a  step  in  advance  towards  the  final  and  complete  emancipation  of the  work 
ing  class.  As  it  is,  the  large  manufacturer,  the  interest  of whose  capital  is  sufficient 
to  maintain  his  household  in  comfort  and  affluence,  is  more  likely,  when  profits 
run low,  to  enter into partnership with his  workpeople,  than the  little  exacting,  avar 
icious,  busy-bodies, who can scarcely hold their ground  against the large  capitalists, 
and  yeam  to  make  a  fortune.

Where,  or how,  the principle  of private property  is  to  have  a fairer trial than  it  has 
as  yet  had  is  beyond  my  comprehension.  In  the  new world,  at  all  events,  there  were 
no  feudal  restrictions  of a  bygone  age  to  overcome,  and  no  established  church  with 
hereditary  prejudices  to  impede  the  development,  in  its  full  vigour,  of the  institu- 
tion  of modern  private  property.  The  new  world  was  taken  possession  of by  the  ad 
vanced  guard  of Europe,  by  the  most  robust,  the  most  energetic,  and  the  most  ad 
vanced—those who preferred braving the dangers and hardships of the wilderness, to 
submitting  peaceably  to  the  social  and  political  fetters  of feudalism  which  cramped 
and  obstructed  the  march  of progress  in  the  old  world.  They  had  only  a  compara-

tively  few  defenceless  savages  to  exterminate  to  make  a  beginning  and  have  a  clear 
start,  and is  not the contention between labour and  capital as fierce and unrelenting 
in  the  new  world  as  in  the  old?  Is  the  social  reformer,  the  man  of new  ideas,  justi 
fied  in  evading  to  criticise  an  institution  as  it  is,  by  the  pretence  that  it  might  be

To  deny  the  'sacredness'  to  one  kind  of private  property  which  is  vindicated  for 
another,  may  have  been  sound  argument  at  a  former  period  of the  world's  history, 
but  private  property  in  the  products  of  labour,  particularly  by  the  instruments  of 
production,  has  assumed  far  too  gigantic  proportions,  and  is  accompanied  by  such 
unsatisfactory relation,  that it is hardly worth while to make  fish  of one  and  flesh  of 
the  other.  "No  man  made  the  land,"  therefore,  it  ought  not  to  be  private  property. 
Who  made the  land,  and how  is  it made  at the  present moment?  The  mountain tor 
rents  carry  the  debris  of  the  denuded  and  constantly  denuding  geological  forma 
tions over which they pass in suspense,  and deposit them as sediments in the low lev-
els,  or  in  the  sea.  Land,  then,  is  the  result  of a  combination  of natural  forces;  the 
whole  surface  of our  globe  is  the  result  of such  combinations;  but  it  is  only  on  the 
banks  of the  largest rivers,  such  as  the  Nile,  the  Jordan,  the  Indus,  the  Ganges,  the 
Mississippi—the  cradles  of culture  and  civilisation—where  man  can  multiply  vege 
tation  with  little  exertion  and  primitive  tools.  In  less  favoured  regions  a  consider-
able  amount of labour is required to  prepare the  soil for culture; therefore man ren 
dered  the  land  suitable  for  the  production  of food.  Who  makes  the  moveables,  and 
how  are  they  made?  Let  us  see.  John  Chinaman  takes  care  of  the  silkworm,  and 
sends  the  silk  which  the  insect  spins  for  the  good  of  its  offspring  to  England—a 
starving  Spitalfield  weaver  converts  it  into  serge.  The  Australian  shepherd  tends 
sheep,  and  sends  their  wool,  which  nature  gave  the  sheep  as  a  protection  against 
wind  and  weather,  to  England—a  surly  and  discontended  Yorkshireman  converts  it 
into  cloth.  The  emancipated  negro  of Georgia  exerts  all  his  ingenuity  to  obtain  a 
crop  of cotton wool,  which  his  employer  sends  to  Liverpool,  and  the  Lancashire  op 
eratives  convert  it  into  calico.  The  Russian  peasant  grows  flax,  Dundee  labourers 
convert  it  into  linen;  and  a  London  tailor,  combining  all  these  materials,  converts 
them  into  a  suit  of  clothes,  say  for  the  Duke  of  Bedford.  The  suit  of  clothes,  we 
find,  is  the  result  of a  combination  of natural  and  social  forces.  The  materials,  after 
having  served  the  purposes  for  which  nature  made  them,  are  converted  into  clo 
thing;  and  although  this  process  is  the  work  of man,  the  Duke  of Bedford  has  never 
35  moved  a finger in  this  process.  He gives  the  tailor an  equivalent,  but neither he  nor 
his  ancestors  have  ever  done  anything  to  produce  that  equivalent,  and  those  who 
produce  it—the  labourers—have  frequently  to  go  short  of food  and  clothing  to  en 
able  him  to  give  that  equivalent.  What  holds  good  with  the  suit  of  clothes  holds 
good  with  every  other  species  of  property—the  result  of  labour.  According  to 
40  Mr. Mill's  own  showing,  those who  work hardest  can  acquire  no  property  at  all,  and 
those who  acquire most  have  the least,  or no need  at  all to work.  As to the  assertion 
that  "no  quantity  which  a  person  can  acquire  prevents  others  from  acquiring  the 
same,"  this  is  rank  nonsense.  The  production  of materials  is  limited  by  the  avail 
able  land  necessary  for  their  production.  If,  with  our  present  means,  we  can  only 
produce  fourteen  million  suits  of clothes  a-year  for  seven  millions  of male  adults,

everybody  who  gets  more  than  two  suits  deprives  others  of their  share.  The  late  Ri 
chard  Cobden  introduced  on  one  occasion  a  friend  of his  to  a  public  meeting  who 
had  risen  from  the  ranks,  and  employed  then  4,000  persons.  Here,  then,  is  a  case 
where  4,000  hired  wages-labourers  are  required  to  set  the  productive  machinery  of 
one  proprietor in motion.  The  chances  against the  labourers  ever becoming proprie- 
tors  are  4,000  to  1.  Unless  Mr. Mill  can  show  that  the  great  majority  of factory  op 
eratives  have  a  reasonable  prospect  of  becoming  millowners  his  argument  falls  to 
the  ground.

As  to  conquest,  the  feudal  baron  had  to  risk  life,  and  he  who  was  attacked  had  a 
chance  of defending  himself.  The  modern  capitalist  need  never  move  off his  couch 
to  render  his  rival's  property  useless.  He  has  but  to  give  his  agents  permission  to 
give  some  clever  mechanician  a  few  pounds  to  improve  his  machinery,  so  that  he 
can  undersell  his  neighbour.  In  the  year  ending  the  31st  October,  1853,  there  were 
98  new  mills  erected  in  Mr.Horner's  district,  with  an  average  horse-power  of 29;  23 
with  an  average  horse  power  of 12  ceased  working.  The  same  movement  is  still  go-  15 
ing  on.  We  have  seen,  in  my previous  articles,  how new  inventions,  generally  intro 
duced  by  large  capitalists,  continually  render  the  property  of the  small  capitalists, 
and  the  skill  of the  operative,  useless.  This  is  the  modern  mode  of conquest.

Private  property  in  moveables  rests  upon  to  better  economical  foundation  than 
private  property  in  land.  No  measure  of amelioration  will  effect  a  cure  of the  près-  20 
ent highly  unsatisfactory  social relations  that  does  not  tend  towards  the joint  owner 
ship  of  the  instruments  of  production,  and  nothing  but  co-operation,  the  joint 
ownership  of all  the  instruments  of production,  can  establish  an  equitable  distribu 
tion  of the  produce  of labour.

If imposed  restraints  and  restrictions  could  make  the  human  family  wise,  virtuous, 
and  happy,  the  world  would  have  been  a  paradise  long  since.  Between  fashionable 
and  artificial,  and  wilfully  imposed  and  enforced  restraints  and  restrictions,  the 
great  mass  of mankind  have  never  been  out  of the  straight jacket  yet.  Experience, 
however,  has  abundantly  proved  that  the  more  the  straight jacket,  which  has  in  all  30 
ages  paralysed  the  community,  is  enlarged  the  better  mankind  prospers.  The  re 
straints  and  restrictions  enforced  at  various  periods  against  the  increase  of popula 
tion  form  no  exception.  Men  of science  tell  us  that  the  inherent  tendency  to  propa 
gate  and  multiply  is  such,  in  every  species  of organism,  that  any  one  species,  if left 
unchecked,  would  in  a  comparatively  short  time  cover  the  whole  globe;  but  as  this  35 
tendency  is  inherent  in  all  of them,  and  as  the  surface  of the  earth  itself conditions 
a variety,  not  any  single  one,  either animal  or vegetable,  has  yet  succeeded  in  cover 
ing  even  any  extensive  tract  to  the  exclusion  of  all  the  others.  Nature,  who  is  the 
mother  of them  all,  has  provided  her  own  remedy. 

That  the  existence  of all  organic  life  is  limited  by  the  existing  means  of subsis-  40 

750 

A working  man's  refutation  ...  XIII.  Wages  and  population 

tence,  everybody  knows.  But,  when  men  like  Malthus,  Mr. Mill,  and,  I  am  sorry  to 
add,  the  editorial  staff  of the  National  Reformer,  apply  this  principle  to  the  human 
species,  they  forget,  in  the  first  instance,  that,  as  a  rule,  the  higher  organisms  feed 
upon  the  lower,  that  the  multiplying  power  increases  as  organisms  descend  in  the 
scale,  and that man has  acquired the means  and  the power to multiply them  accord 
ing  to  his  need.  In  the  second  instance  they  forsake  the  path  of reason  altogether, 
and under the  pretence  of applying  a  scientific  principle  to  the human  species,  they 
apply  it  to  a  state  of society  in  which  the  great  majority  is  doomed  to  suffer  priva 
tions  whatever  the  existing  means  of subsistence  may  be,  a  state  of society  that  in-
flicts  pecuniary  punishment upon  the  producers  whenever  they  allow  full  scope  to 
the  powers  of production.  In  Malthus  and  Mr. Mill  such  a  misapplication  may  be 
excusable.  They  trace  all  the  existing  misery  to  overpopulation,  and  consider  the 
existing  order  of things  in  the  main  as  permanently  tenable  with,  and  conformable 
to  human  happiness;  they  know  no  other  cure  for  the  ills  that  afflict  society  than 
improving those  out of existence who  cannot be used, or used up,  in the  acquisition 
of wealth  for the  possessors  of all  things.  In  an  advanced  section  of men  of progress, 
like  the  writers  in  the  National Reformer,  the  advocacy  of a  doctrine  that wrought  so 
much  mischief when  preached  by  Pagan  and  Christian  monks  of a  byegone  age,  but 
who,  in  spite  of all their zealous  fanaticism,  could  not  divert  mankind  at  large  from 
the  ordinary  path  of nature,  is  unpardonable.  Their  very  tenets  against  the  estab 
lished  religions  imply  a  mental,  a  moral,  a  social,  and  a  political  revolution;  they 
imply  the  dissolution  of a  state  of society  in  which  the  right  of the  labouring  man  to 
live  is  determined  by  the  prospect  that  others  have  to  use  him  in  acquiring  wealth, 
and  the  substitution  of  a  state  of  society  in  which  man  has  a  natural  right  of his 
own  to  live.  In  all  ages,  when  an  established  order of things  has  become untenable, 
men  have  doubted  the  truth  of the  religion  which  sanctioned  that  order  of things, 
and  the  most  material  changes  in  the  world  have  been  contended  for  and  estab 
lished  under  the  banner  of vague,  abstract  beliefs.  The  antique  world,  with  its  slav 
ery  and  idolatry  was  defeated,  and  the  feudal  system  established  under  the  cross. 
Protestantism  defeated  the  Papacy  and  the  feudal  system,  and  asserted  the  claims 
and  established  the  rights  of modern private  property while  pretending  to  fight  sim 
ply  for  the  liberty  of conscience,  and  secularism,  the  protest  against  all  revealed  re 
ligion  is  inseparably  bound  up  with  the  solution  of the  labour  question.  To  accom 
plish  their  historical  mission,  the  secularists  must  take  the  spiritual  lead  of  the 
labour  movement,  but  they  cannot  do  this  as  long  as  they  endorse  and  advocate  a 
doctrine,  the  possible  realisation  of which  is  Malthus's  and  Mr. Mill's  last  refuge  to 
preserve  and  perpetuate  the  rule  of  capital. 

Mr. Mill  says: —"It  is  not  generally  known  in  how  many  countries  in  Europe  di 
rect  legal  obstacles  are  opposed  to  improvident  marriages."  By  the  evidence  ad-
duced it  is  certain  that  Mr. Mill is  as  ignorant of the  causes  of those  obstacles  as  the 
British  public  is  of  the  obstacles  themselves.  The  dwelling  required  in  the  Grand 
Duchy  of Mecklenburg,  before  a parson will  marry  a young  couple,  looks very  inno 
cent  in  an  English  book,  but  let  us  examine  what  it  implies.  The  surging  waves  of 
the  first  French  revolution  passed  harmlessly  by  this  Eldorado  of  feudalism.  It  is 
but  the  other  day  that  a  Mecklenburg  nobleman  sentenced  a  labourer  on  his  estate

to  be  publicly  stripped  and  whipped  for  insubordination;  and  the  sentence,  to  the 
disgrace  of  philosophical  Germany,  was  executed.  Up  to  1848  the  Mecklenburg 
peasantry  were  serfs.  The  nobles  required  a  certain  number  of male  adults  to  culti 
vate  their  estates,  and  for  this  number  they  provided  accommodation.  The  single 
males  and  females,  were  employed  as  farm  and  domestic  servants;  the  married  were 
lodged  in  cottages,  with  sufficient  land  attached  to  support  a  family.  For  this  they 
had  to  work  a  certain  number  of  days  in  the  year  on  the  manor,  the  lord  of  the 
manor having  the  choice  to  call upon  them  any  day he  pleased.  Since  the  Congress 
of Vienna  these  serfs  were  at  liberty to  send  their children where  they  liked  into  ser 
vice  or  to  learn  a  trade,  without  special  permission  from  their  lords,  but  if they  did 
so  their  children  became  homeless,  the  lord  of  the  manor  could  lawfully  expel 
them,  whenever  they  returned  to  their  native  places.  In  the  towns,  not  only  in 
Mecklenburg,  but  in  the  greater  part  of  Germany,  the  old  guild  laws  are  still  in 
force,  or  were  so  until  recently;  but  not  as  of  old  for  the  protection  of  those  who 
have  learned  their  craft,  but  to  their  injury.  For  instance,  in  the  kingdom  of Saxony, 
a  manufacturing  province,  if  a  man  made  a  lock  and  key  for  a  customer,  without 
being  master  and  citizen  of the  place  where  he  made  it,  he  would  be  fined  if the 
masters  found  it  out.  But  the  capitalist  who  owns  a  lock  and  key  factory,  can  pro 
duce  and  sell  as  many  locks  and  keys  as  he  likes  without  any  inconvenience  from 
the  guild.  In  olden  times  joining  a  guild  was  tantamount  to  purchasing  a  living; 
technical  skill,  certain  moral  conditions,  and  entrance  fees  were  required  to  be 
come  a master.  Journeymen,  as  a rule,  were young men; journeyism was  the  interim 
between  the  apprentice  boy  and  the  experienced  man,  who  as  a  rule,  became  mas 
ter.  The journeyman,  as  a  rule,  boarded  and  lodged  with  his  master,  he  was  not  al 
lowed  to  marry.  The  master's  family,  or  household,  consisted  as  much  of journey 
the 
men  and  apprentices  as  of  wife  and  children; 
inexperienced youth who  could  not be  trusted  with,  and  could  not get  the  means  to 
support  a  family.  In  modern times  things  have  greatly  changed.  Many  a poor fellow 
who,  in  conjunction  with  his  sweetheart,  deprives  himself of the  last  farthing  to  be 
come  a  master  and  a  citizen,  has  afterwards  to  look  to  the  factory  for  work.  Where 
no  factory  is  comeatable  master tradesmen work  on  the  high roads  and  do  the  earth 
work  for  the  construction  of railways.  They  are  spellbound,  they  cannot  move  from 
place  to  place where  work might be  had,  only  single  men,  under  30  years  of age  can 
do  that.  I  shall  not  insult  my  readers  by  supposing  that  they  do  not  see  at  a glance, 
the  entire  incompatibility  of  such  restrictions  with  modern  industry.  They  are  at 
best  cruel remnants  of a  bygone  age,  and  are  only  tolerable  in  a  state  of chronic  in 
dustrial  stagnation.

Mr. Mill  deplores  our  unhappy  fate  that  we  do  not  act  like  the  Italians,  high  or 
low,  amongst whom,  according  to  his  statement,  all  but  one  son  of a  family  remain 
unmarried.  He  bitterly  adds  such family  arrangements  are  not likely to  exist  among 
day  labourers.  Sismondi  is  again  called  to  the  rescue,  who  says:—"Any  wise  man 
must  desire  that  the  rising  generation  represents  exactly  those  that  preceded  them; 
that  one  son  and  one  daughter  arrive  at  the  age  of puberty  replacing  his  father  and 
mother;  that  his  grand  children  replace  him  with  his  wife  in  turn;  that his  daughter 
finds  in  another  house  precisely  the  lot  which  he  will  give  to  the  daughter  of  an-

other  house  in  his,  and  that  the  income  which  sufficed  the  fathers  suffices  the 
children.  When  this  family  is  formed  the  exigency  of justice  and  humanity  require 
him to  impose  the  same  restraint upon himself to  which those  who  live  a  life  of cel 
ibacy  submit.  A  father  who  has  eight  children  ought  to  count  that  six  of his  chil-
dren  die  at  an  early age,  or that  six  of his  contemporaries,  and  in  the  following  gen 
eration  three  of  his  sons,  and  three  of  his  daughters  do  not  marry  on  account  of 
him."

This  is  precisely  the  way  in which  the  continental  peasant manages  his  oxen  and 
cows. As  often  as  one  is  got ready for the  butcher a young  one  is reared  to fill up  the 
place.  If there  is  a  good  milk  cow  in  the  village,  the  villagers  will  buy  and  rear  her 
offspring  and  sell  that  of their  own  cows  to  be  killed.  A  pretty  ideal  this  of human 
progress  and  happiness,  to  be  recommended  by  one  of the  greatest  sages  of the  age, 
to  such  a  community  as  the  industrial  working  population  of  the  nineteenth  cen 
tury.  The  state  of things  for  which  Sismondi  laid  down  his  moral  code,  is  that  of 
15  Mecklenburg,  just  described.  There  are  a  certain  number  of cottages  to  be  inhab 
ited,  and  the  number  of  the  rising  generation  required  can  be  determined  with 
mathematical  precision.  Everybody  is,  as  it  were,  chained  to  the  clod  on  which  he 
was  born,  the  same  number  that  was  required,  and  could  subsist  a  thousand  years 
ago,  will  be  required  for  ever  after.  But  how  are  we  to  apply  such  regulations  to  a 
state  of things  in  which  the  improvement  of the  productive  powers  advances  with 
such  rapid  strides,  as  during  the  last  fifty  years,  and  in  which  the  proportionate 
number  of  hands  required  diminishes  as  rapidly  as  the  means  of subsistence,  the 
productiveness  of labour  increases.  Who  is  to  determine,  as  to  who  is  to  have  per 
mission  to  propagate  his  species  and  who  not.  Are  we  to  return  to  the  habit  of our 
Saxon  ancestors,  and kill the  surplus  children  at their birth,  or are  human beings to 
be  served  like  our  domestic  animals  that  are  not  at  all,  or  not  any  longer  required 
for  breeding  purposes?  What  is  to  be  done  with  the  thousands,  and  hundreds  of 
thousands  of adults  whose  labouring  power  is  superseded  by machinery,  or who  are 
replaced  by  children?  Who  is  to  determine  what  number  of  tailors,  shoemakers, 
etc.,  will be required twenty years hence? But above  all who is  to separate the sexes, 
who  is  to  all  intents  and  purposes  to  divorce  husband  and  wife  after  they  have  two 
children,  and  who  is  to  prevent  young  folks  loving  each  other,  because  some  one 
has  more  then two  children,  and  an  increase  of population would  endanger the  con 
tinuance  of the  existing  state  of  things?  Out  upon  such  humbug;  modem  society 
has  better  and  more  elevating  means  to  right  itself than  a  cruel  immolation  on  the 
altar  of  Moloch.

"In  the  case  of the  agricultural  labourer,"  Mr. Mill  says,  "the  checks  to  population 
may  almost  be  considered  as  non-existent.  The  condition  of the  labourers  of some 
40  of the most  exclusively  agricultural counties,  Wiltshire,  Somersetshire,  Dorsetshire, 

753 

Johann  Georg  Eccarius 

Bedfordshire,  Buckinghamshire,  is  sufficiently  painful  to  contemplate.  The  labour 
ers  of these  counties,  with  large  families,  and  seven,  or  perhaps  eight,  shillings  for 
their  weekly  wages  when  in  full  employment,  have  lately  become  one  of the  stock 
objects  of popular  compassion;  it  is  time  that  they  had  the  benefit  also  of some  ap 
plication  of common  sense." 

5 

Before  we  proceed  with  what  Mr. Mill  calls  common  sense,  let  us  see  what  he 
himself admits  under  another  head.  He  says,  "During  the  twenty  or  thirty  years  last 
elapsed,  so  rapid  has  been  the  extension  of improved  processes  of agriculture  that 
even  land  yields  a  greater  produce  in  proportion  to  the  labour  employed."  Now,  I 
ask Mr. Mill, are the laws of nature, the inherent tendency to multiply,  in the remot- 
est  degree  connected  with  the  misery  of  these  labourers?  The  rent  of  land  has  as 
steadily  increased  as  the  produce  of labour,  and  the  number  of labourers  required 
for  profit-mongering  purposes  to  raise  that  produce  has  as  steadily  diminished  as 
the  general  means  of subsistence  have  been  augmented.  It  is  the  institution  which 
makes  the  produce  of one  man's  labour the  private  property  of another that  is  at  the 
bottom  of the  labourer's  misery.  It  is  not  his  natural  fecundity  in  relation  to  the  la 
tent  capabilities  of the  soil  to  afford  the  means  of subsistence,  nor  any  defect  in  the 
productive  power  of  his  labour,  nor  a  deficiency  in  the  actually  existing  means  of 
subsistence,  that  makes  him  wretched,  but  it  is  because  he  lives  in  a  state  of society 
in  which  much  can  be  produced  with  comparatively  little  labour,  and  in  which  the 
welfare  of the  labourer  depends  on  the  cost  of production,  which  assigns  less  to  the 
labourer  in  proportion  as  his  labour becomes  more  productive,  that  he  is  wretched.

Now for the  common sense,—"Discussions on the condition of the labourers,  lam 
entations  over  its  wretchedness,  denunciations  of  all  who  are  supposed  to  be  in 
different  to  it,  projects  of one  kind  or  another  for  improving  it,  were  in  no  county 
and  in  no  time  of the  world  so  rife  as  at present;  but there  is  a  tacit  agreement to  ig 
nore  totally  the  law  of wages,  or  to  dismiss  it  in  a  parenthesis  with  such  terms  as 
'hard-hearted  Malthusianism,'  as  if it were  not  a  thousand  times  more  hard-hearted 
to  tell  human  beings  that  they  may,  than  that  they  may  not,  call  into  existence 
swarms of creatures who are sure to be miserable,  and most likely to be  depraved.  Is 
it true  or  not that  if their numbers were  fewer  they would  obtain  higher wages?  This 
is  the  question,  and  no  other;  and  it  is  idle  to  divert  attention  from  it  by  attacking 
any  incidental  position  of Malthus,  or some  other writer,  and  pretending  that  to  re 
fute  that  is  to  disprove  the  principle  of  population."  The  fault  rests  entirely  with 
Malthus  and his  disciples.  They  alone  are  responsible  for the  confusion  and  compii- 
cation  in which their pet theory  is  entangled.  They  have  outraged  and profaned  in  a 
blasphemous  manner  a  scientific  principle—that  of life  being  limited  by  the  means 
of subsistence—and  used  it  as  a  screen  to  hide  their  ignorance  of the  true  basis  of 
all human progress.  What is  true  of a particular class,  and  under a  peculiar phase  of 
social development,  they have  applied to the whole species;  and while  ignoring one  40 
of  the  main  attributes  of the  species,  they  have  endeavoured  to  argue  on  general 
grounds  that  which  appertains  to  a  special  case.  As  I  have  already  shown,  if by  any 
contrivance  ten  men  could  be  enabled  to  produce  next  year  as  much  wealth  for  the 
capitalist  as  a  hundred  produce  this year,  the  ten  kept  at  work  would  receive  only  a 
starvation  pittance  while  any  of the  ninety  remained  to  compete  with  them.  In  this  45 

30

754 

A working  man's  refutation  ...  XIV.  Wages and  population.—Continued 

case  the  population  would  be  to  the  means  of  subsistence  afforded  by  the  rule  of 
capital  like  9  to  1.  This  is  the  overpopulation in  the  actual  state  of society,  it  is  the 
special  case  for  which  the  Malthusian  proposes  to  provide  a  remedy  by  a  restraint 
upon  population,  but  it  is  also  the  special  case  which  all.the  Malthusians  evade  to 
discuss,  their  arguments  being  based  upon  the  assumption  that  the  number  of  la 
bourers  required  remains  the  same,  that  an  increase  of their numbers  only  has  to  be 
prevented.  It  is  far  easier  to  upbraid  and  insult  parents  for  having  children  than  to 
show  how  nine  men  out  of  ten  whose  labour  is  considered  indispensable  to-day, 
and  may  become  useless  to-morrow,  can  be  improved  out  of existence.  However,  to 
answer  Mr. Mill's  pointed  question  distinctly,  I  will  declare  that  it  is  beyond  ques 
tion  that  if there  was  work  in  any  given  trade  for  a  thousand  men,  and  only  nine 
hundred  do  it,  they  would  get  more  for  doing what  they  could  than  1,200  would  get 
for  doing  it  all.  But  this  is  all  I  can  admit  of his  theory.  The  Malthusian  creed  rests 
upon  the  assumption  that  society  can  attain  no  higher  form  than  that  which  repre-
sents mankind as divided into capitalists and hired wages labourers. The Malthusian 
therefore  is  blind  to  the fact that  the  existing  disorder of things  has  produced within 
its  own  bosom  the  germ  of a  superior  state  of society.  He  can  only  see  excrescenses 
and  local  and  accidental  irregularities,  which he  tries  to  patch  up  by  palliatives.  To 
him  anything  that  threatens  the  fundamental  basis  is  tantamount  to  a  destruction 
of all  civilisation—of human  society  itself.  Any  Malthusian  who  advocates  co-op 
erative  self-employment  is  like  a  champion  of the  Divine  right  of kings  advocating 
constitutional  representative  self-government;  he  advocates  two  causes,  of  which 
the  complete  success  of  either  implies  the  extinction  of the  other.

Under  the  regime  of private  capital,  productive  powers  have  been  developed  ca-
25  pable  of  furnishing  ample  means  of  subsistence  to  a  more  numerous  population 
than  that  provided  for  by  the  existing  mode  of  distribution.  Mr.  Mill  advocates  a 
better  distribution  and  considers  a stricter restraint on  population,  an  indispensable 
means  to  it.  Vain  hope!  If you  restrict  the  population,  you  cripple  the  development 
of  the  powers  of  production.  The  capabilities  of  the  productive  powers  and  the 
30  wants  of society,  a  consequence  of the  numerical  strength  of the  population—have 
reached  the  point  at  which  private  ownership  in  the  instruments  of production  be 
comes  a  nuisance,  and  an  obstruction  to  further  progress.  Those  instruments  are 
the  social  product  of all  the  preceding  generations  of the  human  race.  They  are  the 
natural  inheritance  of  every  living  generation,  their  administration  and  manage-
35  ment  is  a  question  of expediency.  The  regime  of capital  enables  thousands  to  revel 
in  luxury,  without  doing  anything,  brings  production  to  a  standstill  when  millions, 
able  and  willing  to  work,  are  slowly perishing  from want  of food.  It  is  a  nuisance,  an 
obstruction,  away  with  it.  A  restraint  on  population,  if  such  a  thing  were  possible, 
would  render  our  productive  acquisition  useless.  A  further  increase  of population 
40  will  burst  the  shackles  and  remove  the  barriers  which  prevent  the  living  generation 
from  enjoying  the  inheritance  bequeathed  by  its  ancestors.  So  much for  the  special 
case. 

Mr.  Mill  continues: —"Is  it  not  allowed  on both sides,  that  in old  countries,  pop 
ulation  presses  too  closely  upon  the  means  of subsistence?"  I say,  No!  To  compare

pation  of Europeans,  who  use  the  same  appliances  that  are  used  in  a  country,  the 
inhabitants  of which  have  acquired  them  during  the  successive  stages  of  develop 
ment from barbarism  to  the  highest  known  state  of civilization  and  density  of popu 
lation—is  shifting  the  question,  and  amounts  to  a  shuffle.  To  prove  the  Malthusian 
theory  it  must  be  demonstrated  that  the  ancient  Britains,  the  Anglo  Saxons,  the 
Aborigines  of  America  and  Australia,  possessed  ampler  means  of  satisfying  their 
wants  than  we  do.  Let  us  hear  Professor  Senior's  opinion:  "The  state  of savage  na 
tions  is  a  state  of habitual  poverty  and  occasional famine.  A  scanty  population,  and 
scantier  means  of  subsistence.  If  a  single  country  can  be  found  in  which  there  is 
now  less  poverty  than  is  universal  in  a  savage  state,  it  must  be  true  that,  under  the  10 
circumstances  in  which  that  country  has  been  placed,  the  means  of  subsistence 
have  a  greater  tendency  to  increase  than  the  population. 

5 

If it  be  conceded,  that  there  exists  in  the  human  race  a  natural  tendency  to  rise 
from  barbarism  to  civilization,  and  that  the  means  of  subsistence  are  proportion 
ately more  abundant  in  a civilized  than  in  a  savage  state,  and  neither  of these  pro-  15 
positions  can  be  denied,  it  must  follow  that  there  is  a  natural  tendency  in  subsis 
tence  to  increase  in  a  greater  ratio  than  population. 

All  that  degrades  the  character,  or  diminishes  the  productive  power  of a  people, 
tends  to  diminish  the  proportion  of subsistence  to  population  and  vice  versa.  And, 
consequently,  that  a  population  increasing  much  more  rapidly  than  the  means  of  20 
subsistence  is,  generally  speaking,  a  symptom  of mis-government  indicating  deeper 
seated  evils,  of which  it  is  only  one  of the  results."  I  entirely  endorse  this  opinion. 
Fifty  years  ago  Malthus  pointed  with  horror  to  China  as  an  over populated  coun 
try  where  people  sold  their  daughters,  killed  their  new  born  children,  and  in  times 
of scarcity,  sold themselves  into  slavery  to  procure  food.  China was  then  about  eight  25 
times  as  large  as  France,  and  had  a  population  of  330,000,000;  a  population  of 
41,625,000  in  France  would  be  equally  dense,  and  is  nearly  reached.  How  does 
modern  France  fare?  In  1760  the  consumption  of wheat  amounted  to  108  litres  per 
head;  in  1784,  to  125;  under  the  first  empire  to  133,  and  since  1840,  to  175,  the 
population  has  more  than  doubled  during  that  time.  It  is  therefore  not  want  of  30 
space  that  cripples  the  means  of  subsistence  in  China,  but  it  is  an  obsolete  and 
barbarous  mode  of production,  antiquated  social,  political,  and  proprietary  arrange 
ments,  tolerated  by a  degenerating race,  that cripples the resources.  During the  17th 
century  nearly  every  second  year  was  a  year  of dearth;  during  the  18th  every  3rd; 
during  the  19th  every  4th;  over  the  whole  of Europe. 

35 

According  to  the  last  returns  of the  Board  of Trade,  the  density  of the  population 
in  the  different  countries  is,  per  square  mile:  United  Kingdom  258;  Italy  225; 
France  180;  Prussia  179;  Austria  155;  Spain  84;  Russia  in  Europe  31;  Turkey  19; 
United  States  11.  The  Turks  occupy  one  of the  fairest  regions  of Europe,  and  if the 
scientific  part of the Malthusian population theory were  correct,  the Turks would be 
the  best  provided  nation  of Europe,  we  know  they  are  the  worst  by  far.  Four  hun 
dred  years  ago,  when  the  Europeans  first  set  foot  upon  America,  the  red  Indians 
suffered  from  famine  and  all  the  calamities  and  diseases  inseparable  from  famine. 
Four  hundred  years  the  Europeans  have  poured  in  and  multiplied  at  a  rapid  rate, 
but  there  is  now  no  fear  of famine  except  from  social  causes.

The  Commonwealth. 
Nr. 211, 23. März 1867 

Of  the  popular  remedies  for  low  wages,  Mr. Mill  says:—"The  simplest  expedient 
which  can  be  imagined  for  keeping  the  wages  of labour  up  to  the  desirable  point, 
would  be  to  fix  them  by  law.  Some  have  proposed  to  fix  a  minimum.  Another plan 
5  which has  found many  advocates  among  the  leaders of the  operatives,  is  to form lo 
cal  boards  of trade,  and  promulgate  a  rate  of wages  based  upon  natural  equity,  not 
upon  the  state  of the  labour market.  Others  think  the  employers  ought to  give  suffi 
cient  wages,  and  if  they  do  not  willingly,  should  be  compelled  by  general  opin 
ion." 

10 

15 

20 

"Popular  sentiment  looks  upon  it  as  the  duty  of the  rich,  or  of the  state  to  find 
employment  for  all  the  poor.  If the  moral  influence  of opinion  does  not  induce  the 
rich  to  spare  from  their  consumption  enough  to  set  all  the  poor  to  work  at  'reason 
able  wages,'  it  is  supposed to  be  incumbent  on  the  state  to  lay  on  taxes  for  the  pur 
pose,  either by  local  rates,  or votes  of public money.  The  proportion  between  labour 
and  the  wages  fund  would  thus  be  modified  to  the  advantage  of the  labourers,  not 
by  restriction  of  population,  but  an  increase  of  capital."  "If  this  claim  on  society 
could  be  limited  to the  living generation;  if nothing  more were  necessary  than  a nu 
merous  accumulation,  sufficient  to  provide  permanent  employment  at  ample  wages 
for  the  existing  numbers  of  the  people;  such  a  proposition  would  have  no  more 
strenuous  supporter  than  myself." 

30 

"But  it  is  another  thing  altogether,  when  those  who  have  produced  and  accumu 
lated  are  called  upon  to  abstain  from  consuming  until  they  have  given  food  and  clo 
thing,  not  only  to  all  who  now  exist,  but  all  whom  these  or  their  descendants  may 
think  fit  to  call  into  existence.  Such  an  obligation  acknowledged  and  acted  upon, 
25  would  suspend  all  checks,  both  positive  and  preventive;  there  would  be  nothing  to 
hinder  population  from  starting  forward  at  its  rapidest  rate;  and  as  the  natural  in 
crease  of capital  would,  at  least,  not  be  more  rapid  than  before,  taxation,  to  make 
up  the  growing  deficiency,  must  advance  with  the  same  gigantic  strides.  The  at 
tempt would  of course  be  made  to  exact labour  in  exchange  for  support.  But  experi-
enee  has  shown  the  sort  of work  to  be  expected  from  the  recipients  of public  char 
ity.  When  the  pay  is  not  given  for  the  sake  of work,  but  the  work  found  for  the  sake 
of the  pay,  inefficiency  is  a  matter  of certainty;  to  exact  real  work  from  day  labour 
ers  without  the  power  of  dismissal,  is  only  practicable  by  the  power  of  the  lash." 
"But  let  them  work  ever  so  efficiently,  the  increasing  population  cannot  increase 
the  produce  proportionally:  the  surplus,  after  all were  fed,  would  bear a less propor 
tion  to  the  whole  produce  and  to  the  population:  and  the  increase  of the  people  go 
ing  on  in  a  constant  ratio,  while  the  increase  of produce  went  on  in  a  diminishing 
ratio,  the  surplus  would  in  time  be  wholly  absorbed;  taxation  for the  support  of the 
poor  would  engross  the  whole  income  of the  country;  the  payers  and  the  receivers 
40  would  be  melted  down  into  one  mass.  The  check  to  population  either  by  death  or 
prudence,  could  not  then  be  staved  off any  longer,  but  must  come  into  operation 

35

suddenly  and  at  once;  every  thing  which  places  mankind  above  a  nest  of ants  or  a 
colony  of beavers,  having  perished  in  the  interval." 

"Every  one  has  a  right  to  live.  We  will  suppose  this  granted.  But  no  one  has  a 

right  to  bring  creatures  into  life,  to  be  supported  by  other  people." 

"It would  be  possible  for the  state  to guarantee  employment at  ample wages to  all 
who  are  born.  But  if it  does  this,  it  is  bound  in  self-protection,  and  for  the  sake  of 
every  purpose  for which government  exists,  to  provide  that  no  person  shall  be  bom 
without  its  consent.  If the  ordinary  and  spontaneous  motives  to  self-restraint  are  re 
moved,  others  must  be  substituted.  Restrictions  on  marriage,  at  least  equivalent  to 
those  existing  in  some  German  states,  (three  cheers  for  Mecklenburg)  or  severe 
penalties  on  those  who  have  children  when  unable  to  support  them,  would  then  be 
indispensable."

This  is  the  common sense  of the  most  celebrated  of all the  political  economists  of 
established  celebrity.  Reader!  you  who  know  Mr. Mill's  political  economy  only  by 
the  praises  bestowed  upon  it  by  the  capitalist  press,  do  you  not  feel  an  inkling  to 
start  and  announce  this  gospel  of  salvation  to  all  who  have  been  deprived  of  em 
ployment  in  consequence  of the  crisis  of  1866,  and  tell  them  that  their  parents  are 
at  the  root  of the  evil  for  having  brought  them  into  life  without  previously  insuring 
them the means of subsistence, and that they in their generation are worse than crim 
inals  for  persisting  in  the  same  course  after  Malthus  and  his  great  prophet  have 
laid  down  the  golden rule  for human happiness?  It  is  clear that Mr. Mill's  social phi 
losophy  has  not  yet  passed  the  boundaries  of the  43rd  of Elizabeth  and  the  parish 
stoneyard  and  oakum  room  substituted  by  the  poor  law  of the  liberal  Parliament  in 
1834.  It  is  the  nakedest  and  most  misanthropic  expression  of the  proprietarian  and 
utilitarian  point  of view  of the  natural  right  of man  to  live.  It  sanctions  the  arroga-  25 
tion  of capitalists  to  claim  all  the  produce  of labour  as  their  absolute  and  exclusive 
private  property,  and  treats  that  portion  which  must  be  surrendered  without  an  in 
creased  return towards the maintenance  of the producers  as public  charity.  Remem 
ber  the  Stockport  spinners!  Was  the  improved  machinery,  purchased,  between  1840 
and  1843  by  the  millowners,  with  the  profits made  out of the  labour of the  800  spin- 
ners who were previously employed at 11.  2s.  a week,  and the fact that after the estab 
lishment  of  the  improved  machinery,  the  140  spinners,  working  three  times  the 
number  of  spindles  they  had  previously  worked,  for  13s.  a  week,  a  test  that  they 
were  morally  disqualified  to  bring  children  into  life?  Or  was  it  a  test  that  with  in 
creased  facilities  to give  employment  to  the  poor,  the  accumulation  of the  prerequi-  35 
sites  of  production  would  remain  stationary,  or  that  increased  production  would 
progressively  diminish  the  productive  power  of  labour?  Has  the  labourer  who  has 
procured  the  means  of subsistence  for  an  increased  and  increasing  population,  no 
natural  claim,  no  moral  claim,  no  claim of any kind  to  its  benefits,  save  the  bone  of 
contention,  and  the  moral  struggle  for  existence  which  those  who  deprive  him  of  40 
the  fruits  of his  toil  vouchsafe  for  his  lot?  Is  he  to  be  visited  with  severe  penalties 
for  having  children,  while  others  revel  in  the  luxuries  which  he  produced?  Who 
brings  creatures  into  life,  to  be  supported  by  other  people,  the  poor?  Never!  They 
support  their own  and  other  people's  too.  The  rich  do  not  even  grant  their  offspring 
the  food  which  nature  has  provided  for  it,  the  mother's  milk.  The  women  of  the  45

poor and  the  cows  have  to replace  the  mothers  of wealthy infants,  and  the poor have 
to  nurse  them,  find  food,  clothing,  shelter,  and  amusement  for  them  into  the  bar 
gain  when  they  grow  up.  Then  punish  the  rich  for  begetting  children.  Send  every 
lady  who  does  not  suffer  from  bodily  infirmity,  who  refuses  to  do  the  natural  duty 
of a  mother  to  her  child,  to  a  nunnery;  and  every  gentleman  who  becomes  a  father 
without  adding  to  the  stock  of the  consumables  of the  community  into  solitary  con 
finement  on  workhouse  fare.

Mr. Mill  asks  next:—"By  what  means,  then,  is  poverty  to  be  contended  against? 
How  is  the  evil  of  low  wages  to  be  remedied?  If  the  expedients  usually  recom 
ió  mended  for  the  purpose  are  not  adapted  to  it,  can  no  others  be  thought  of?  Is  the 
problem  incapable  of solution?  Can  political  economy  do  nothing,  but  only  object 
to  everything,  and  demonstrate  that  nothing  can  be  done?

All  experience  shows  that  the  mass  of mankind  never judge  of moral  questions 
for  themselves,  never  see  anything  to  be  right  or  wrong  until  they  have  been  fre-
quently  told  it;  and  who  tells  them that they have  any  duties  in  the  matter in  ques 
tion, while  they  keep  within  matrimonial limits?  Who  meets with  condemnation,  or 
rather,  who  does  not  meet  with  sympathy  and  benevolence,  for  any  account  of evil 
he  may  bring  upon  himself and  those  dependent  on  him,  by  this  species  of inconti 
nence?  While  a man who  is  intemperate  in  drink,  is  discountenanced  and  despised 
by  all  who  profess  to  be  moral  people,  it  is  one  of the  chief grounds  made  use  of in 
appeals  to  the  benevolent,  that  the  applicant  has  a  large  family  and  is  unable  to 
maintain  them."  To  this  the  following  foot-note  is  appended:—"Little  improvement 
can  be  expected  in  morality,  until  the  producing  of large  families  is  regarded  with 
the  same  feeling  as  drunkenness  or  any  other  physical  excess."—One  would  im-
agine  that  children  were  rained  down  upon  married  people,  direct  from  heaven, 
without  their  being  art  or  part  in  the  matter;  that  it  was  really,  as  the  common 
phrases  have  it,  God's  will  and  not  their  own,  which  decided  the  numbers  of their 
offspring. 

"But  let  us  try  to  imagine  what  would  happen  if the  idea  became  general  among 
the  labouring  class,  that  the  competition  of  too  great  numbers  was  the  principal 
cause  of their  poverty,  so  that  every  labourer  looked  (with  Sismondi)  upon  every 
other  who  had  more  than  the  number  of  children  which  the  circumstances  of  so 
ciety  allowed  to  each,  as  doing  him  a  wrong—as  filling  up  the  place  which  he  was 
entitled  to  share.  Any  one  who  supposes  that  this  state  of opinion would  not  have  a 
great  effect  on  conduct,  must  be  profoundly  ignorant  of human  nature;  can  never 
have  considered  how  large  a  portion  of the  motives  which  induce  the  generality  of 
men  to  take  care  even  of their  own  interest,  is  derived  from  regard  for  opinion— 
from  the  expectation  of being  disliked  or  despised  for not  doing  it."  Mr. Mill winds 
up  with  stating  that,  "If a  prudent  regulation  of population  be  not  reconcilable  with 
the  system  of hired  labour,  the  system  is  a  nuisance,  and  the  grand  object  of eco 
nomical  statesmanship  should  be  to  bring  the  labouring  people under  the  influence 
of stronger  and  more  obvious  inducements  of this  kind  of prudence,  than  the  rela 
tions  of workmen  and  employers  can  afford." 

The  grand  remedy  is  to  transport  at  once  a  considerable  fraction  of the  youthful 
agricultural  population  to  the  colonies,  at  the  public  expense;  the  other  is  to  raise

small  proprietors,  the  proposition  already  alluded  to.  Lest  there  should  be  any 
doubt  as  to  the  reactionary  tendency  of these  remarks,  let  us  see  what  the  great  Re 
former  says  two  years  later,  towards  the  end  of the  second  volume.  "If it  were  evi 
dent  that  a  new  hand  could  not  obtain  employment  but  by  displacing  or  succeeding 
to  one  already  employed,  the  combined  influence  of prudence  and  public  opinion 
might  generally  be  relied  on  for  restraining  the  coming  generation  within  the  num 
bers  necessary  for  replacing  the  present.

I  cannot  therefore  regard  the  stationary  state  of capital  and  wealth  with  the  unaf 
fected  aversion  so  generally  manifested  towards  it by the  political  economists  of the 
old  school." 

10 

There  you  have  the  quintessence  of what you have to  expect  in the  shape  of prog 
ress  if you  hand  your  affairs  over  to  the  custody  of the  new  (?)  school,  originally  es 
tablished  by  Parson  Malthus  and  adopted  in  the  lump  by  John  Stuart  Mill.  Only 
fancy  what  a  pleasant  life  it  would  be  if human nature  could  be  so  far degraded  and 
debased  as  to  look  upon  a  pregnant  woman  with  the  same  disdain  as  upon  a 
drunken  harlot  lying  in  the  gutter,  or  treat  an  honest  man  with  a  large  family  of 
little  children  in  distress  in  the  same  manner  as  a  drunken  vagabond  asking  for 
alms;  or  to  be  down  upon  the  children  of your  neighbour  like  the  hens  in  a  farm 
yard  when  they  get  a  stranger  among  them,  according  to  the  precepts  of Sismondi. 
One  necessary  accompaniment  to  such  a  moral  code  would  be  some  visible  sign, 
easily  distinguishable,  to  inform  strangers  whether  a  woman  was  pregnant  with  or 
without  the  consent  of the  authorities,  that  she  might  be  treated  accordingly.  For 
schoolmasters  and  schoolmistresses  none  would  be  better  qualified  than  old  maids 
and  old  bachelors  who  had  been  disappointed  in  love  and  cordially hated  the  oppo 
site  sex.  They would  also  be  the best magistrates  and  legislators.  Happily humanity 
has  rejected  similar teachings  at  a time  when  there was  far less  prospect  of making 
life  comfortable  than  there  is  now,  and  when  eternal  salvation  was  held  out  as  a  re 
ward  instead  of  the  questionable  luxury  of  improved  wages-slavery  for  the  many, 
and  the undisturbed  possession  of unbounded  wealth by  the  few.  Mr. Mill  seems  to 
be  credulous  enough  to  believe  that  an  opinion  can  be  created  to  curb  the  most  in- 
domitable  instinct,  inherent  in  all  organic  life,  but  he  requires  the  lash  to  make 
people  work  to  sustain  life  in  ease  and  comfort.  The  opinion  of  one's  fellow  men 
counts  for  nothing  here.  Is  there  no  possibility  of finding  employment  for  people  in 
distress,  but  on  the  plan  of the  stone-yard  and  the  oakum-room?  Is  it  not  possible 
that  at  no  very  distant  date  the  working  class  will  have  sufficient  power  in  Parlia- 
ment  to  do  for  itself what  the  landowners  are  doing  now  under  the  Land  Improve 
ment  Act,  obtain  credit  to  extend  self-supporting  co-operative  labour?  Is  it  not  re 
markably  strange  that  Mr. Mill  should,  among  his  popular remedies,  not  so  much  as 
allude  to  the  most  popular  of all,  and  the  one  that  is  the  peculiar  child  of modern 
industry,  the  one  that  was  first  demanded  by  the  factory  operatives  of Lancashire 
more  than  fifty  years  ago—I  speak  of the  reduction  of the  number  of  the  hours  of 
labour.  This  is  the  measure  of progress  which  will  to  some  extent  equalise  the  sup 
ply  of,  and  the  demand  for,  labour;  on  its  progress  and  success  depends  the  social, 
the  mental,  and  moral  elevation  of  the  working  class;  on  its  success  depends  the 
progress  of  co-operative  self-employment—it  will  march  apace  with  it.  It  is  the

measure  which,  as far  as  it  has  been  carried,  has fulfilled  all that was  expected  from 
it,  and  it  is  also  the  measure  which,  as  Professor  Fawcett  (to  his  honour  be  it  said) 
has  several  times  pointed  out  in  the  House,  will  ere  long bring  some  of us  manhood 
suffrage  advocates  to  loggerheads  with  some  of  our  present  political  allies,  and 
bring  us  into  friendship  with  the  Tories.  I  have  much more  to  say  on this point,  but 
must  reserve  it  for  a  future  occasion.

And  now  a  few words  about  the  stationary  state.  If the  tendency  to  multiply  is  in 
herent,  a  stationary  state  is  unnatural,  and  can  only  precede  a  positively  declining 
state.  If at  any  of the  numerous  stages  of the  development  of the  human  species  it 
had  been  possible  permanently  to  arrest  the  increase  of population,  and  hinder  it 
from  overstepping  the  existing  limits  of  the  means  of  subsistence,  even  prospec 
tively,  that  moment  would  have  been  the  end  of all  human  progress,  and  it  will  be 
the  end  of all  human  progress  whenever  that  moment  arrives.  Had  the  wiseacres  of 
the  Stone  period  succeeded  in  limiting  the  number of families  to  the  number  of the 
stone  caves  provided  by  nature,  no  building  trades  would  ever  have  troubled  the 
world,  no  tailors  would  be  required,  man,  like  his  step-brother,  the  ape,  would  be 
confined  to  certain  geographical latitudes.  As  it  is,  the  rebels,  the  unruly  multitude, 
have  never  cared  much  for  established  notions,  and  hence  the  great  mass  of man 
kind  has  plodded  on  in  happiness,  and  grief,  and  woe,  frequently  with  bloody 
heads,  in  search  of  a  higher  destiny.  The  race  has  incessantly  advanced,  but  the 
same  section  was  not  always  at the  head.  Each particular  epoch produced the  germ, 
the  foundation  for a  superior  state  of things,  though  the  nations  that  produced  it  re 
signed  the  lead.  Asia  Minor  and  Egypt,  the  mothers  of  the  civilisation  of  ancient 
Greece,  resigned  the  lead  to  ancient  Greece;  Greece  in  her turn  produced  the  civili-
sation  of Rome,  and resigned  the  lead  to  Rome;  Rome  succumbed  to  the Teutonic 
barbarians,  they  gathered  up  the  debris  of  the  empire  they  had  sacked,  became 
Christians,  and  established  the  feudal  state  upon  its  ruins.  From  that  moment  until 
the  present  hour  the  lead  has  remained  with  the  descendants  of  those  barbarous 
Teutons.  The  feudal  state  produced  a  revolutionary  class  within  its  own  bosom, 
30  which  destroyed  the  work  of its  ancestors,  and  established  the  modern  state  upon 
the  ruins;  the  modem  state  has  produced  a revolutionary  class,  the modern working 
class,  which has  all  the  required  energy,  tact,  and  courage  to  subvert,  in  its  tum  the 
institutions  of  its  predecessors,  and  establish  a  superior  state  of  things  upon  the 
very  same  spot. 

25 

35 

40 

Since  the Thirty  Years'  War  the  Anglo-Saxon branch  of the Teutonic  family  has 
acquired  the  lead;  during  the  present  generation  the  American  offshoot  has  entered 
into  competition.  Old  Germania  has  been  asleep  for  many  a  year,  but  she  is  rapidly 
shaking off her  shackles  to  come to  the  rescue;  the  sons  of France  are  only  lurking 
in  ambush ready  for  a  call;  but  if John  Bull  should  prove  unworthy  of the  lead,  and 
does  riot  quickly  clear  the  Augean  stable  of all  the  antiquated  filth  that  has  gath 
ered  about  him,  and  threatens  a  serious  interruption  to  the  further  increase  of pop 
ulation,  if he  listens  to  the  advice  of Mr. Mill  and  his  abettors,  Brother  Jonathan  is 
sure  to  snatch  the  lead  from  him,  and  deprive  Old  England  and  the  rest  of the  Old 
World  of the  honour  of marching  arm  in  arm  with  him  to  the  emancipation  of  the 

45  human  race.

During  the  whole  course  of history  not  a  single  tribe  or  nation  can  be  cited  that 
remained  progressive  with  a  stationary  population;  we  cannot  remain  progressive 
now  if we  put  more  restraints  on  population  than  those  we  cannot  avoid.  With  the 
means  of  production  at  present  known,  this  country  could  produce  food  for  four 
times  its  present  inhabitants,  and  human  nature  will  burst  the  chains  of wages-slav 
ery,  and  scatter  proprietory  rights  to  the  winds  before  it  will  submit  to  self-immola 
tion  to  sustain  an  untenable  state  of stagnation  and  misery.

Third  Annual  Report 
of the  International  Working  Men's  Association. 

T he  D u t i es  I m p o s ed  u p on  the  G e n e r al  C o u n c il 
by  the  First  A n n u al  Congress. 

5  The  Congress passed  a resolution  appointing  the  London  delegates  to wait upon  the 
Swiss,  the  French,  and  the  British  postal  authorities  to  bring  the  question  of Inter 
national  penny  postage—of cheap  postage—under  their  notice.  The  Swiss  postmas 
ter  agreed  to  all  the  deputation  urged,  but  observed  that  the  French  Government 
stopped  the  way.  In  France  the  delegates  could  get  no  audience,  and  the  British 

10  Government  only  consented  to  receive  a  written  statement  which  has  been  sent. 

The  other  duties  imposed  upon  the  General  Council by  the  first  annual  Congress 
were:  1.  The  publication,  in  several  languages,  of the  transactions  of the  Congress, 
including  the  letters  and  memoirs  addressed  to  that  Congress.  2.  To  publish  period 
ical  or  occasional  reports  in  different  languages,  embracing  everything  that  might 
be  of interest  to  the  Association.  3.  To  give  information  of the  supply  and  demand 
for  labour  in  different  localities.  4.  An  account  of co-operative  societies.  5.  Of the 
condition  of the  working-class  in  every  country.  The  Council  was  also  charged  with 
causing  a  statistical  enquiry  to  be  instituted,  which  was  to  contain  special  and  de 
tailed  information  about  every  branch  of  industry,  in  which  wages  labour  is  em-
ployed,  in  the  most  civilised  countries  of Europe. 

To  enable  the  Council  to  fulfil  these  various  duties,  the  Congress  voted  a  contri 
bution  of threepence  per member  to  the  Executive,  and  a  salary  of £2  a week  to  the 
general  secretary,  leaving  his  appointment  to  the  Council. 

As  soon  as  the  London  delegates  had  returned,  and  the  Council  was  reorganised, 
information  was received  that  some  of our  Congress  documents  had  been  seized  on 
the  person  of Jules  Gottraux  by  the  French  police  on  the  frontier.  The  general  sec 
retary was  instructed  to  write  to  the  French  minister  of the  interior,  but  not  receiv 
ing  any  reply,  an  application  was  made  to  the  British  Foreign  Office.  Lord  Stanley, 
with  the  greatest  readiness,  instructed  Lord  Cowley,  the  British  Ambassador  at  Pa-
ris,  to  intercede;  the  result was  that within  a few  days  our documents were  restored, 
and  a  parcel  of "Tribunes  du  Peuple"  which  had  evidently  been  seized  from  some-

body  else  superadded.  The  Congress  documents  were  then  handed  over  to  the 
standing  committee,  with  instructions  to  prepare  the  report  for  publication.  As 
there  were  no  funds  to  pay  the  general  secretary  this  labour  devolved  upon  volun 
teers,  who  had  to  do  it  in  their  spare  hours,  which  caused  further  delay.  When  all 
was  ready  the  lowest  estimate  to  have  a  thousand  printed  in  one  language  was  £40. 
To  comply  with  the  Congress  instructions  required  an  immediate  outlay  of £120; 
the  cash  in  hand  on  the  31st  of December  amounted  to  18s.  4d. 

The  general  secretary  was  instructed  to  appeal  to  the  affiliated  societies  of  the 
British  section  for  their  contributions—only  the  London  cigar-makers  and  the  Cov 
entry  and  Warwickshire  ribbon-weavers  responded  immediately.  The  board  of man- 
agement  of the  latter  association,  with  a  highly  commendable  zeal  to  fulfil  its  obli 
gation—having  no  funds  in  hand  and  many  members  out  of work—forthwith  raised 
a  levy  to  the  required  amount  from  the  members  in  work. 

The  council  then  availed  itself of an  offer made  by  citizen  J. Collet,  the  proprietor 
and  editor  of the  International  Courier,  to  publish  the  report  in  French  and  English 
in  weekly  parts  in  the  columns  of  his  journal.  He  also  agreed  to  stereotype  the 
whole  at his  own  expense  with the view of publishing  it  in pamphlet form,  and  to  let 
the  Council  share  in  the  profits,  if  any,  the  Council  undertaking  no  responsibility 
whatever in  case  of loss.  But  hardly was  this  highly  advantageous  arrangement  com 
pleted when,  on account of not  having  complied with  some  legal  intricacy,  of which 
the  Government  had  previously  taken  no  notice,  citizen  Collet  had  to  suspend  the 
publication  of his journal  for  several weeks,  and  it was  not till  March that the  publi 
cation  of  the  Congress  report  could  be  regularly  proceeded  with.  The  numbers  of 
the  International Courier  containing  the  report have  been  sent  gratis  to  the  branches. 
A German version  could,  for want of a similar opportunity,  not be  published. When 
the  publication  was  completed  it  was  again  want  of funds  that  prevented,  and  still 
prevents,  the  publication  in  pamphlet  form*.  To  make  matters  worse  the  French  po 
lice  seized  a  parcel  of  rules  and  cards  of  membership,  purposely  issued  for  the 
French  section,  the  printing  of which  cost  £4,  which  was  borrowed  money.  Besides 
this  dead  loss,  there  was  the  further  injury  of curtailing  the  contributions,  which  in 
France  depend  principally  upon  the  scale  of  individual  membership.  Beyond  all 
this,  there  were  the  old  liabilities  which were  acknowledged  as  the  debt  of the  asso 
ciation  by  the  Congress,  but  no  special  provision  made  for  their  liquidation.  They 
have  greatly  hampered  our  action,  and  continue  to  be  a  source  of trouble.

Under  these  circumstances  it  was  utterly  impossible  to  publish  either  periodical 
or  occasional  reports,  nor have  our  correspondents  taken  the  trouble  to  send us  any 
special  information with  a view  to  such  publication.  The  question  of entering  upon 
the  statistical  inquiry  had  to  be  abandoned  for the  present  year.  To  be  of any use  at 
all  it  cannot  be  limited  to  the  trades  at  present  comprised  within  the  circle  of our 
affiliated  societies.  Such  an  inquiry,  to  answer  its  purpose,  must  include  every  40 
trade,  every  country,  and  every  locality.  This  involves  not  only  a  large  expenditure 
for  printing,  stationery,  and  postage,  but  also  an  amount  of labour  in  the  shape  of 
correspondence,  compiling,  and  arranging  the  scattered  and  specific  statement  into 
a  comprehensive  and  comprehensible  whole,  that  the  possibility  of having  it  done 
by  volunteers  in  their  leisure  hours  is  altogether  out  of the  question.

Interference  in  T r a d e s'  Disputes. 

10 

15 

One  of  the  best  means  of  demonstrating  the  beneficent  influence  of  international 
combination  is  the  assistance  rendered  by  the  International  Working  Men's  Asso 
ciation  in  the  daily  occurring  trades'  disputes.  It  used  to  be  a  standard  threat  with 
5  British  capitalists,  not  only  in  London,  but  also  in  the  provinces,  when  their  work 
men  would  not  tamely  submit  to  their  arbitrary  dictation,  that  they  would  supplant 
them  by  an  importation  of foreigners.  The  possibility  of  such  importations  taking 
place  was  in  most  cases  sufficient  to  deter  the  British  workmen  from  insisting  on 
their  demands.  The  action  taken  by  the  Council  has  had  the  effect  of putting  a  stop 
to  these  threats  being made  publicly.  Where  anything  of the  kind is  contemplated  it 
has  to  be  done  in  secret,  and  the  slightest  information  obtained  by  the  workmen 
suffices  to  frustrate  the plans  of the  capitalists.  As  a rule,  when  a strike  or a  lock-out 
occurs  concerning  any  of the  affiliated  trades,  the  continental  correspondents  are  at 
once  instructed  to  warn  the  workmen  in  their  respective  localities  not  to  enter  into 
any engagements  with the  agents  of the  capitalists  of the place where  the  dispute  is. 
However,  this  action  is  not  confined  to  affiliated  trades.  The  same  action  is  taken 
on  behalf of other  trades  upon  application  being  received.  This  generally  leads  to 
the  affiliation  of the  trades  that  invoke  our  aid.  Now  and  then  it  happens  that  the 
capitalists  succeed  in  getting  a  few  stragglers,  but  they  generally  repudiate  their  en-
gagements  upon  being  informed  of the  reason  why  they  were  engaged.  During  the 
London  basket-makers  dispute  last  winter  information  was  received  that  six  Bel 
gians were at work under the railway-arches  in Blue Anchor-lane,  Bermondsey.  They 
were  as  strictly  guarded  against  coming  in  contact  with  the  outside  public  as  a  kid 
napped girl in  a nunnery.  By  some  stratagem  a  Flemish  member of the  Council suc-
ceeded  in  obtaining  an  interview,  and  upon  being  informed  of the  nature  of their 
engagement  the  men  struck  work  and  returned  home.  Just  as  they  were  about  to 
embark  a  steamer  arrived  with  a  fresh  supply.  The  new  arrivals  were  at  once  com 
municated  with;  they  too  repudiated  their  engagements,  and  returned  home,  prom 
ising  that  they  would  exert  themselves  to  prevent  any  further  supplies,  which  they 
accomplished.  In  consequence  of the  appeals  made  by  deputations  from  the  Coun 
cil  to  various  British  societies,  the  Paris  bronze-workers  received  very  considerable 
pecuniary  support  during  their  lock-out,  and  the  London  tailors  on  strike  have  in 
tum  received  support  from  continental  associations  through  the  intercession  of the 
Council.  The  good  offices  of the  Council  were  also  employed  on  behalf of the  exca-

Propaganda  a nd  Affiliated  Societies. 

40  The  work  of  propaganda  and  affiliation  of  societies  has  been  greatly  impeded  in 
England  during  the  past  year.  It  seems  as  if  the  British  Legislature  could  never 
move  a  step  in  the  right  direction  in  any  matter  of great  social  or  political  impor 
tance  unless  compelled  by  a  threatening  and  overwhelming  pressure  from  without,

when  the  public  excitement  assumes  the  character  of a  monomania.  While  the  Re 
form  agitation  was  at  its  height,  the  frequent  monster  demonstrations  in  course  of 
organisation,  it  was  almost  hopeless  to  try  to  engage  the  attention  of working  men 
to  the  somewhat  distant  aims  of  the  International  Working  Men's  Association. 
Most  of  our  British  Council  members  took  an  active  part  in  these  proceedings, 
which  reduced  our  available  forces  to  go  on  deputations,  while  the  proceedings 
themselves  caused  so  much  excitement  and  absorbed  so  much  of the  attention  of 
those  who  might  have  entertained  our applications,  that there was  no  room for their 
consideration.  These  proceedings,  too  in  diverting  men's  attention  to  other  objects 
have  had  the  effect  of preventing  many  new  members  being  enrolled  and  some  old 
ones  to  renew  their  subscriptions.  Everywhere  one  was  met  with  the  observation 
that  the  struggle  for  Parliamentary  Reform  was  [not]  only  the  struggle  of  a  season, 
but  the  paramount  duty  of  the  hour  and  an  indispensable  stepping  stone  to  that 
complete  emancipation  of  the  working  classes  from  the  domination  of  capital 
which is the  aim  of the  International Working  Men's Association.  One  step  has  un-  15 
doubtedly  been  gained  by  the  Act  of  1867.  It  is  sufficiently  comprehensive  to  en 
able  the  working  classes  to  politically  combine  for  class  purposes  within  the  pre 
cincts  of the  Constitution,  and  exercise  a  direct  influence  upon  the  Legislature  in 
matters  of social  and  economical  reform  in  as  far  as  they  affect  the  labour  question. 
But  though  our  propagandism  has  been  much  impeded  during  the  past  it  has  not 
been  arrested.  The  ordinary  mode  of proceeding  with  the  affiliation  of  corporate 
bodies  is  somewhat  tedious.  When  the  Council  has  any  reasonable  ground  for  be 
lieving  that  the  question will  be  favourably  entertained  by  an  association,  it  applies 
to  the  president  or  secretary  by  letter.  If  the  application  be  favourably  received,  a 
deputation  is  requested  to  attend the  Executive  to  state  the  aims  of the  association. 
If the  Executive  endorses  the  statement  of the  deputation  it  recommends  the  ques 
tion to  be  entertained  at  some future  general or delegate  meeting,  when  perhaps  the 
deputation  is  again  requested  to  attend.  In  some  cases  the  question  of affiliation  is 
decided  at  once—in  others  the  votes  of  all  the  members  and  branches  have  to  be 
taken to  arrive  at  a  decision. 

20 

25 

30 

The  affiliation  of  33  organised  bodies  has  been  brought  about  in  this  manner 
during  the  past  year.  More  than  twenty  have  been  corresponded  with  and  received 
deputations.  With  some  the  decisions  are  pending,  others  have  deferred  the  consid 
eration  to  a  more  favourable  opportunity;  only  one  society  has  flatly  refused  to  en 
ter  into  any  relationship  because  the  association  entertains  political  questions.

Contributions  and  Affiliated  Societies. 

The  question  as  to  the  contributions  of affiliated  societies  occupied  the  Council  at 
various  times.  While  the  question  was  pending,  the  Executive  of  the  Operative 
Bricklayers'  Society joined  and  agreed  to  contribute  £1  per annum.  In  March,  1865, 
a  deputation  from  the  Council waited  on  the  conference  of the  Amalgamated  Cord- 
wainers'  Association,  at  which  the  following  resolution,  proposed  by  the  delegate 
from  Birmingham,  and  seconded  by  the  delegate  from  Hull,  was  unanimously  car-

ried:  "That  we  cordially  agree  with  the  principles  of  the  International  Working 
Men's  Association  as  represented  by  the  deputation  from  that  body,  and  pledge 
ourselves  to  join  them  for  the  furtherance  of  those  principles,  and  endeavour  to 
spread  them  amongst  our  constituents."  The  question  of contributions  was  raised, 
but  the  discussion  being  out  of order was  stopped.  Some  weeks  after  it was  resolved 
that  a  declaration  of  enrolment  should  be  printed,  for  which  organised  bodies 
should  pay  an  entrance  fee  of 5s.,  that  as  many  cards  as  possible  should  be  sold  to 
individual  members  of  such  societies,  the  remainder,  when  funds  were  required, 
should  be  left  to  their generosity.  It was  while  this  state  of things  lasted  that  the  lia-
bilities  already  alluded  to  were  incurred.  The  money  granted  by  various  affiliated 
societies  last  year  were  voluntary  gifts  towards  defraying  the  expenses  of  the  del 
egates  to  the first Congress,  and  it was  expended  for that  purpose.  The  Cordwainers' 
Executive  granted  £5.  To  remove  this  state  of uncertainty  the  Council  proposed  a 
minimum  contribution  per  member  from  affiliated  societies.  The  Congress  voted 
threepence,  which  the  British  delegates  maintained  could  not  be  levied  from  trade 
societies  in  England. 

When,  after  the  Geneva  Congress,  our  deputations  were  sent  to  trade  societies,  it 
was  found  that,  as  the  British  delegates  had  foreseen,  the  threepence  per  member 
formed  an  insurmountable  obstacle  to  the  affiliation  of  organised  bodies.  On  the 
9th  of  October  the  council  resolved  unanimously  that  the  contribution  should  be 
lowered  to  one  halfpenny  per  member.  All  the  societies  that  have  since  been  affil 
iated  have joined  with  that  understanding. 

The  Amalgamated  Cordwainers'  Association has  distinctly  declared  that  the  reso 
lution  of  its  Conference  of  1865  does  not  amount  to  an  affiliation,  and  the  Confer-
enee  of  the  same  body  of  1867  has  rescinded  the  resolution,  which  enabled  the 
Council to grant us £5  last year.  The  executive of the Operative Bricklayers has  paid 
£1  for  1867,  but  has  not  yet  announced  any  decision,  whether  it  considers  the 
whole  society  affiliated  or  not.  The  Cordwainers'  Association  was  put  down  in  last 
year's  estimate  as  containing  5,000  members,  the  Bricklayers'  3,000  to  4,000.  Two 
appeals have  been made  in the  course  of the  year for the  contributions;  some  of the 
previously  affiliated  societies  have  paid,  others  have  not;  but,  excepting  the  cord 
wainers,  none  have  repudiated  their  obligation. 

The  executive  of  the  Amalgamated  Carpenters  and  Joiners  has  recently  passed 

resolutions  to  contribute  £2  per  annum  to  the  funds  of the  Council,  but the  ques-
tion  is  now under  consideration to  take  the votes  of all the members  whether the  as 
sociation  is  to  be  affiliated  in  its  entirety  or  not.  It  numbers  about  9,000  members, 
and  extends  over  England,  Wales,  and  Ireland.  The  following  is  a  list  of the  affil 
iated  societies  of the  British  section,  and  the  money  furnished  by  them  during  the 
last  two  years.

There  is  a  considerable  difference  in  the  actual  income  of  the  two  years,  but 
there  is  an  essential  difference  as  to  its  purport.  Last  year  the  money  was  voted  to 
send  delegates  to  the  Congress;  it  was  therefore  not  available  for  other  purposes; 
this  year's  income  consists  of contributions  to  defray  the  expense  of administration. 
Last year, we  incurred  liabilities because we had no  settled  income;  this year, we  li-
quidated  liabilities,  because  we  had  such  an  income.  The  reason  why  some  of our 
affiliated  societies  have  not yet paid  their annual  contribution,  and why others  have 
not  contributed  to  the  Congress  fund,  is  severe  pressure  upon  their  funds  in  conse 
quence  of the  stagnation  of  trade,  strikes,  and  lock-outs.  We  have  received  several 
letters,  stating  these  as  reasons  why  the  same  societies  that  contributed  so  hand-
somely towards  the  Congress fund last year,  cannot give  anything  this  year.  The  tai 
lors'  strike  has  absorbed  all  the  available  funds  of the  London  trade  societies.

As  a  rule  the  General  Council  only  corresponds  with  individual  branches  abroad, 
where  police  restrictions  prevent  the  formation  of branches. 

25 

In Belgium  an  attempt has been made  to  affiliate  trade  societies,  but we  have  no 

information  about  the  result,  nor  have  we  received  any  contributions. 

Germany is  still  in  an  unsettled  state.  Citizen  Philip  Becker,  the  president  of the 
German  section  at  Geneva,  has  succeeded  in  establishing  several  branches,  but  we 
have  no  particulars  at  present. 

30 

In Italy  there  is  a  regular working  men's  organization  with whose  officers  we  are 

in  correspondence,  but  formal  affiliations  have  not  yet  taken  place. 

In  the  New  World,  we  have  two  affiliated  branches  at  New  York  and  Hoboken, 
N.J.  We  are  in  correspondence  with  the  national  labour union  committee,  and  the 
president  of the  International  Ironmoulders'  Union.  Particulars  will be  found  in  the 
special  report  of the  American  Secretary.

G e n e r al  R e m a r k s. 

The  past  year  has  been  characterised  by  intense  struggles  and  agitation.  In  Amer 
ica,  in  England,  in  France,  in  Belgium  strikes,  lock-outs,  persecution  and  prosecu 
tion  of the  working  class  have  been  the  order of the  day.  The  capitalists  have  perse-

769 

Third  Annual  Report  of  the  International  Working  Men's  Association 

veringly  treated  the  workmen  as  nobodies  who  only  exist  obsequiously  to  submit. 
One  society  in  the  United  States  has  spent  70,000  dois,  to  resist the  encroachments 
of the  capitalists;  in England  it has  been  decided  in the  courts  of law that to  rob  the 
funds  of trades  unions  is  not  punishable  by  law.  An  official  inquiry  into  the  work 
ing  of trades  unions  has  been  instituted  with  a  view  to  damage  their  character  and 
to  affix  to  them  the  stigma  of being  criminal  in  their  proceedings.  The  wholesale 
prosecutions  of the  London  master  tailors  against  their  men,  the  attitude  of magis 
trates, judges,  and  the  daily press,  the  convictions  of the  Paris  tailors  and  the  massa 
cre  at  Marchienne,  are  facts  that  demonstrate  incontrovertibly  that  society  consists 
but  of  two  hostile  classes—the  oppressors  and  the  oppressed—and  that  nothing 
short  of a  solidary  union  of the  sons  of toil  throughout  the  world  will  ever  redeem 
them  from  their  present  thraldom.  We  therefore  conclude  with  the  motto:  Proleta 
rians of all  Countries,  Unite.

-  Devoirs  imposés  par  le  Congrès  de  Genève. 

(Septembre 

1866.) 

Les  devoirs  qui  furent  imposés  au  Conseil  général  par  le  Congrès  de  Genève  sont 
les  suivants : 

Io  Le  Congrès  adopta  une  résolution,  autorisant  les  délégués  anglais  à  faire  les 
10  démarches  nécessaires  auprès  des  directeurs  des  postes  en  Suisse,  en  France  et  en 
Angleterre,  pour  obtenir une  réduction  pour  le  transport  des  lettres  et  imprimés. 

Le  ministre  suisse  fut  d'accord  avec  la  délégation  sur tous  les  points  proposés par 
elle,  mais  il  fit  remarquer  que  le  gouvernement  français  entravait  toute  réforme  en 
ce  sens. 

15 

En  France,  les  délégués  ne  purent  obtenir  audience  du  directeur  des  postes. | 
|4|  En  Angleterre,  le  gouvernement  ne  consentit  qu'à  recevoir  un  mémoire  expo 

sant les  faits.  Ce  travail  fut  rédigé  par le  Conseil général,  qui  attend  une  réponse. 

2°  La  publication  des  travaux  du  Congrès,  avec  les  lettres  et  mémoires,  en  plu 

sieurs  langues ; 

20 

3°  La  publication  d'un  bulletin  périodique,  dans  les  différentes  langues,  renfer 
mant  tout  ce  qui  pouvait  intéresser  l'Association  internationale ;  de  fournir  toute 
information  concernant  le  travail  dans  les  différents  pays,  et  des  rapports  sur  les  so 
ciétés  coopératives  et  sur  la  position  sociale  des  travailleurs ; 

4°  Le  Conseil  général  fut  aussi  requis  de  faire  une  enquête  statistique  sur  le  tra-
25  vail,  contenant  des  rapports  détaillés  et  spéciaux  sur  chaque  branche  de  l'industrie 

et  de  l'agriculture  et  embrassant  tous  les  pays  civilisés. 

Pour mettre  le  Conseil  à même  de  remplir  ces  devoirs,  une  cotisation  annuelle  de 
30  centimes  par  membre  fut  votée  par  le  Congrès,  ainsi  qu'une  rémunération  de 
2  livres  par  semaine  pour  le  secrétaire  général ;  le  choix  de  ce  dernier fut  laissé  au 

30  Conseil général. 

Lorsqu'après  le  retour  des  délégués,  le  Conseil  commença  ses  travaux,  il  reçut  la 

771 

Rapport du  Conseil  Général  de  l'A. I.T.  au  Congrès  de  Lausanne  (1867) 

nouvelle  que  plusieurs  documents  importants  avaient  été  saisis  à  la  frontière  fran 
çaise,  sur  la  personne  de  Jules  Gottraux,  par les  agents  de  police. 

Le  secrétaire  général  fut requis  d'écrire  au  ministre  de  l'intérieur  en  France  pour 
obtenir la restitution  des  dits  documents.  Cette  lettre  étant restée  sans  réponse,  une 
demande  fut  adressée  au  ministre  des  affaires  étrangères  anglais ;  lord  Stanley  en- 
voya  les  instructions  nécessaires  à  lord  Cowley,  ambassadeur  anglais  à  Paris,  pour 
obtenir  la  restitution  des  documents. 

5 

Au  bout  de  quelques jours,  ces  documents  nous  furent rendus  avec  un  paquet  de 
journaux :  La  Tribune  du  Peuple,  lequel  paquet  avait  évidemment  dû  être  saisi  sur 
une  autre  personne. 

10 

Cet  incident  occasionna  au  Conseil  un  retard  de  plusieurs  mois  pour  la  publica 

tion  des  travaux  du  Congrès. | 

|5|  Les  documents  furent  remis  au  sous-comité,  afin  qu'il préparât  le  rapport  offi 

ciel. 

Le  Conseil général n'ayant pas  d'argent pour payer le  secrétaire général,  le travail 
incomba  aux  membres  assez  dévoués  pour  l'accomplir  en  dehors  de  leurs  travaux 
ordinaires,  ce  qui  nécessita  plus  de  temps. 

15 

Lorsque  ce  travail  fut  fait,  le  plus  bas  prix  qui  fut  demandé  pour  l'imprimer  fut 

de  fr.  1000  pour  1000  exemplaires  en  une  seule  langue. 

Pour  que  le  Conseil  général  exécutât  la  résolution  du  Congrès,  une  dépense  im- 
médiate  de  fr.  3000  était nécessaire ;  l'argent  en  caisse  à  ce  moment  se  montait  à fr. 
22,90. 

20 

Le  Conseil  général  fit  un  appel  aux  sociétés  anglaises  adhérentes  pour  le  paie 

ment  des  cotisations. 

Les  Cigariers de Londres  et  les  Rubaniers  de  Coventry  et  du  Warwickshire  seuls  ré-  25 

pondirent. 

Le  Conseil  exécutif de  ces  derniers,  avec  un  zèle  à  remplir  ses  obligations  que 
nous  devons  signaler,  sans  argent  en  caisse  et  ayant  la plupart  de  ses  membres  sans 
travaux,  fit  une  levée  de  fonds  extraordinaire  parmi  ceux  qui  travaillaient. 

Le  Conseil  général  ayant  épuisé  tous  les  moyens  pour  publier  le  rapport  du 
Congrès,  tant  en  France  qu'à  l'étranger,  accepta  du  citoyen  Collet,  le  rédacteur  du 
Courrier International  et  du  Workingman,  l'offre  de  le publier  dans  ces  deux journaux 
hebdomadaires,  en  français  et  en  anglais ;  il  s'engagea  en  outre  à  faire  stereotyper 
les  clichés  pour pouvoir publier ce rapport  en brochures  et à partager avec  le  Conseil 
général  tous  les  bénéfices,  quoiqu'il  acceptât  d'avance  pour  lui  toutes  les  pertes. 

30 

35 

A  l'annonce  faite  par  ces  journaux  de  la  publication  du  Congrès  de  Genève,  le 
gouvernement  anglais,  qui  depuis  plusieurs  années  les  laissait  paraître  sans  obsta 
cles,  trouva  le  prétexte  pour  en  interrompre  la  publication,  en  demandant  au  ci 
toyen  Collet  de  fournir  deux  cautionnements  de  plusieurs  milliers  de  francs.  Cette 
formalité retarda jusqu'au  9  mars la publication.  ||6|  Depuis,  le  citoyen Collet  a su, 
de  source  certaine,  que  cet  incident  avait  eu  lieu  à  l'instigation  du  gouvernement 
français. 

40 

Ceci,  joint  à  la  saisie  du  mémoire  des  délégués  parisiens,  fait  voir  clairement  le 
parti  auquel  s'est  arrêté  le  gouvernement  français  à l'égard  de  l'Association  interna 
tionale.

réuni  du  2  au  8  septembre  1867  à  Lausanne.

des  Travailleurs  ..." 

Rapport du  Conseil  Général  de  ΙΆ.Ι.Τ.  au  Congrès de  Lausanne  (1867) 

Les numéros  du  Courrier international contenant ce rapport furent envoyés  gratis  à 
tous  les  correspondants  de  l'Association.  La  traduction  en  allemand  fut  forcément 
laissée  de  côté,  le  Conseil  général  n'ayant  aucune  facilité  pour  la  faire. 

5 

Quoique  le  tout  soit  stéréotypé,  le  manque  de  fonds  a  empêché, jusqu'à  ce jour, 
la  publication  en  brochures,  ce  qui  est  cependant  demandé  avec  instance  par  tous 
nos  correspondants. 

Pour  tourner  ces  difficultés,  un  des  membres  du  Conseil  avança  100  francs  pour 
l'impression  de  1000  exemplaires  des  carnets,  contenant  le  Pacte  Constitutif et  les 
Règlements :  800  de  ces  carnets  furent  envoyés,  mais  ils  furent  saisis  par la  police 
française ;  cette  perte vint  encore  aggraver la  situation  du  Conseil général,  situation 
d'autant  plus  précaire  qu'il  était  harcelé  de  toutes  parts  pour  la  dette  de  plus  de 
mille  francs,  contractée  en  1865  et  1866 ;  car bien que  le  Congrès de  Genève  eût re 
connu  cette  dette  solidaire,  il n'avait  indiqué  aucun moyen  efficace  pour l'éteindre. 
Dans  ces  circonstances,  il  était  de  toute  impossibilité  pour  le  Conseil  de  publier 
aucun  rapport  ou  bulletin  périodique,  ainsi  que  l'avait  voté  le  Congrès;  la  consé 
quence  fut l'abandon  forcé  de  l'enquête  statistique  pour l'année  1867,  car,  pour être 
efficace,  cette  enquête  ne  peut  être  restreinte  aux  sociétés  adhérentes,  elle  doit  em 
brasser toutes  les  branches  de  la  production  dans  toutes  les  localités.  Ce  travail,  de 
mandant des  pertes  de  temps considérables et  des dépenses très-élevées,  ne  pouvait 
être  fait  par  le  Conseil  général  dans  la  situation  pécuniaire  où  il  se  trouvait. |

-  Rôle  de  l'Association  Internationale  des  Travailleurs 

dans  la  lutte  entre  le  Capital  et  le  Travail. 

Les  nombreux  services  rendus  par  l'Association  dans  les  différentes  luttes  entre  le 
capital  et  le  travail,  dans  les  divers  pays  où  elles  ont  eu  lieu,  démontrent  suffisam-
25  ment la nécessité  d'une  telle  association.  Lorsque  les  ouvriers  refusaient  d'accepter 
les  conditions  arbitraires  des  capitalistes  anglais,  ceux-ci les menaçaient de  les rem 
placer par  des  bras  appelés  du  continent.  La possibilité  d'une  pareille  importation  a 
suffi plusieurs fois pour faire  céder les  ouvriers.  L'action du  Conseil a  empêché  que 
ces  menaces  ne  fussent  faites  publiquement  comme  autrefois.  Lorsque  de  pareils 
faits  se  présentent,  il  suffit  de  la  plus  légère  indication  pour  déjouer  les  plans  des 
capitalistes.  Survient-il  une  grève  ou  un  lock-out1,  parmi  les  sociétés  adhérentes  à 
l'Association,  les  ouvriers  de  tous  les  pays  sont  immédiatement  informés  de  l'état 
de  choses,  et  conséquemment mis  en  garde  contre  les  offres  des  agents  des  capita 
listes.  Néanmoins,  cette  action  n'est  pas  seulement  circonscrite  aux  sociétés  adhé-
rentes,  car le  concours  de l'Association est acquis  à toutes celles  qui le réclament. 

30

Parfois  les  capitalistes  réussissent  à  attirer  quelques  ignorants  qui  les  abandon 

nent  aussitôt  qu'ils  sont  instruits  de  leurs  droits  et  de  leurs  devoirs. 

Le  capital  ne  considère  l'ouvrier  que  comme  une  machine  à  production,  rien  de 
plus;  le  dernier  lock-out  de  vanniers  de  Londres  en  offre  un  exemple  frappant. 
40  Voici  les  faits.  Les  patrons  vanniers  de  Londres  déclarèrent  à  leurs  ouvriers  qu'ils 

1 Les Anglais  appellent ainsi la fermeture  des  ateliers par les patrons. 

775 

Rapport du  Conseil  Général  de  ΓΑ. I. T.  au  Congrès de  Lausanne (1867) 

eussent  à  dissoudre  leur  société  et  à  accepter une  diminution  dans  un  délai  de  trois 
jours,  leur  annonçant  que  faute  de  ce  faire  par  eux,  à  l'expiration  de  ce  délai,  les 
ateliers  leur  se||8|raient  fermés.  Devant  un  fait  aussi  brutal,  les  ouvriers  se  révoltè 
rent  et  déclarèrent  ne  pas  accepter  ces  conditions ;  les  patrons  avaient  prévu  le  cas, 
car  des  agents  étaient  partis  pour  la  Belgique  et  ramenaient  des  ouvriers  ...  Ces 
ouvriers  furent  parqués  sous  les  arches  du  chemin  de  fer,  dans  un  des  quartiers  de 
Londres  (Bermondsey).  Là  ils  devaient travailler,  manger  et  dormir,  sans  sortir,  afin 
d'éviter tout  contact  avec  les  autres  ouvriers.  Mais  le  Conseil général  parvint  à fran 
chir  le  cordon  sanitaire  institué  par  les  patrons,  et,  par  un  stratagème,  s'introduisit 
auprès  des  ouvriers  belges;  le  lendemain  ces  ouvriers  ayant  compris  leur  devoir re-  10 
tournaient  en  Belgique,  indemnisés  de  leur temps perdu  par la  société  des  vanniers 
de  Londres.  Comme  ils partaient,  arrivait justement un  autre  bateau  chargé  d'autres 
ouvriers ;  mais  cette  fois  ils  furent reçus  par nous  et  ils  repartaient par le bateau  sui 
vant.  Il fut impossible  après  cela  aux patrons de  se  procurer d'autres ouvriers :  le ré 
sultat fut  que  les  patrons  se  virent  forcés  de  laisser les  choses  telles  qu'elles  étaient 
précédemment.

En  conséquence  de  l'appel fait par le  Conseil  aux  sociétés  anglaises,  les  bronziers 
de  Paris  reçurent  un  appui  moral  et  matériel  dans  leur  grève ;  d'un  autre  côté,  les 
tailleurs  de  Londres  reçurent  un  pareil  appui  des  ouvriers  du  continent. 

Le  Conseil  intervint  avec  autant  de  succès  dans  la  grève  des  terrassiers,  treílla-  20 

geurs,  coiffeurs,  zingueurs  et  graveurs sur bois.

-  Section  anglaise. 

A.  Propagande. 

En  Angleterre,  si  la  propagande  n'a  pas  été  aussi  active  que  l'année  dernière,  les 
raisons  en sont faciles à déduire de  ce qui suit :  ce n'est jamais par l'initiative  ||9|  du  25 
gouvernement  qu'un  pas  est  fait  dans  la  voie  libérale,  ce  n'est  que  lorsque  de  lon 
gues  agitations  ont passionné  les  masses  qu'il  cède  enfin  à  la  pression populaire,  té 
moin  la  question  de  réforme  électorale  et  du  droit  de  réunion  dans  les  parcs. 

Les  travailleurs  anglais  attachent une  grande  importance,  avec  raison,  à  la  ques 

tion  électorale;  ils  sacrifient  leur  temps  et  leur  énergie  à  organiser  d'imposantes  30 
manifestations,  dont  la  force  morale  en  impose  au  gouvernement  et  le  force  à  don 
ner  satisfaction  au  vœu  populaire. 

Pendant  qu'ils  réclamaient énergiquement leurs  droits  de  citoyens,  il était impos 
sible  au  Conseil général  d'appeler  l'attention  des  ouvriers  sur  les  questions  sociales, 
dont  ils  n'entrevoyaient  l'issue  que  dans  un  avenir  lointain. 

35 

Les  membres  anglais  du  Conseil général,  qui  devaient le plus  nous  aider dans  no 
tre  œuvre  de  propagande,  ne  pouvaient  se  tenir  à  l'écart  de  ce  mouvement  que  nous 
avions créé  et qu'ils  devaient  conduire.  Le  succès  a  répondu  à  leurs  efforts,  et  l'année 
1867  sera  ajamáis  célèbre  dans  les  annales  de  la  classe  ouvrière  anglaise. 

Cependant,  si  la  propagande  n'a  pas  été  aussi  active  qu'elle  aurait  dû  l'être,  par  40 

les  raisons  que  nous  avons  données  ci-dessus,  elle  ne  fut  pas  arrêtée  un  seul  ins 
tant :  Les  formalités  à remplir pour obtenir l'adhésion  des  sociétés  ouvrières  deman-

Rapport du  Conseil  Général de  ΓΑ.Ι.Τ.  au  Congrès de  Lausanne (1867) 

dent  beaucoup  de  temps ;  la  constitution  démocratique  des  Trade's  Unions  ne  permet 
pas  au  Comité  exécutif de  prendre  une  décision  sur  une  question  importante  sans 
que  toutes  les  branches  l'aient  préalablement  discutée. 

Voici  le  mode  à  suivre  pour  obtenir  l'adhésion  d'une  société.  On  écrit  au  comité 
le  but  de  la  demande.  Le  Comité  fixe  un jour  pour  recevoir  une  deputation.  Si  la 
question  est  prise  en  considération,  le  Comité  la  soumet  à  ses  branches;  alors  il 
faut attendre un,  deux et  souvent trois  mois  avant de  connaître  le résultat.  Il ne  faut 
pas  conclure  de  ce  que  nous  venons  de  dire  ||10|  que  le  comité  d'une  société puisse 
seul proposer  ou  rejeter une  proposition,  car très  souvent  des  branches  ont  adhéré  à 
l'Association  internationale  sans  la  participation  du  comité. 

Depuis le  Congrès  de Genève,  plus de vingt des grandes  sociétés ouvrières  ont ac 
cueilli  favorablement  les  deputations  du  Conseil  général ;  il  en  attend  le  résultat  de 
jour  en jour.  D'autres  sociétés  ont  remis  leur  adhésion  à  un  temps  plus  opportun ; 
une  seule  a  refusé  son  adhésion,  se  basant  sur  ce  que  l'Association  internationale 
s'occupait  de  questions  politiques. 

B.  Cotisations. 

Cette  question  a  occupé  pendant  longtemps  le  Conseil  général.  Pendant  que  cette 
question  était  en  litige,  le  Comité  exécutif des  maçons  se joignait  à  l'Association  et 
votait  une  cotisation  annuelle  de  1  livre. 

En mars  1865, une  deputation fut envoyée par le  Conseil général à la Conférence 
des  cordonniers  anglais,  où  la résolution  suivante,  proposée par les  délégués  de Bir 
mingham  et  de  Hull,  fut votée  à  l'unanimité :  «La  Conférence  accepte  les  principes 
de  l'Association  internationale,  déclare  s'y joindre  et  engage  tous  les  membres  pré 
sents  à  faire  tous  leurs  efforts  pour  les  propager. »  La  question  de  la  cotisation  fut 
soulevée,  mais  non résolue.  Quelque  temps  après,  le  Conseil général décidait qu'un 
diplôme  d'adhésion  serait  remis  à  toute  société  qui  se joindrait  à  l'Association ;  la 
société  devait  payer  un  droit  d'entrée  de  5  shillings1  et  le  Conseil  général  laissait  à 
la  libéralité  des  sociétés  de  décider  dans  quelles  proportions  elles  pourraient  nous 
aider.

L'argent  donné  par  les  sociétés  était  un  don  de  ||11|  leur  part  pour  défrayer  le 

Conseil  général  des  frais  de  délégation  au  Congrès  de  Genève. 

Le  Comité  des  cordonniers  donna  5  livres  à  cet  effet. 
Afin  de  régulariser  cette  situation,  le  Conseil général  proposa  une  cotisation  uni 

forme  pour  chaque  membre. 

35 

Le  Congrès  de  Genève  décida  que  la  cotisation  annuelle  serait  fixée  à  30  cen 

times. 

Après  le  Congrès,  les  délégations  envoyées  par  le  Conseil  près  des  sociétés  an 
glaises  rencontrèrent  un  obstacle  insurmontable  dans  le  prix  élevé  de  cette  cotisa 
tion. 

40 

Dans  cette  situation,  le  Conseil décida,  dans  sa  séance  du  9  octobre,  d'abaisser  à 

1 Un shilling vaut fr. 1,25 ;  la livre sterling vaut fr. 25 ; le  sou anglais vaut  10 c.

5  centimes  la  cotisation  annuelle.  La  Société  des  cordonniers  (Amalgamated  Cord-
wainers'  Association)  nous  annonça  que  la  résolution  qui  avait  été  prise  dans  la 
Conférence  de  1865  avait  été  retirée  par  la  Conférence  de  1867 ;  cette  résolution 
était  de  souscrire  pour  une  somme  annuelle  de  5  livres. 

Le  Comité  exécutif des  maçons  nous  donna  1  livre  pour  l'année  1867,  comme  il 
l'avait fait  déjà  pour l'année  1866 ;  mais  il ne  nous  a  pas  encore  annoncé  si  toute  la 
Société  était  adhérente  ou  non. 

5 

La  Société  des  cordonniers  comptait  l'année  dernière  5000  membres,  celle  des 

maçons  de  3000  à  4000. 

Deux  appels  ont  été  faits  par  le  Conseil,  pour  le  paiement  des  cotisations  pen- 
dant  l'année  1867,  à  toutes  les  sociétés  adhérentes.  Quelques-unes  ont  payé, 
d'autres  ne  l'ont  pas  encore  fait ;  mais  aucune,  excepté  celle  des  cordonniers,  n'a 
décliné  ses  obligations. 

La  Société  des  charpentiers  et  menuisiers  réunis  a,  tout  récemment,  pris  la  réso 
lution  de  contribuer pour 2  livres  par an  aux fonds  du  Conseil général.  La  question 
se  discute  en  ce  moment  dans  les  branches  pour  savoir  si  toute  la  Société  fera  par 
tie  de  l'Association 
internationale.  Cette  Société,  qui  compte  plus  de 
9000 membres,  a des  branches dans toute l'Angleterre,  le pays  de  Galles,  l'Ecosse  et 
l'Irlande.

La  différence  qui  existe  entre  les  deux  années  pour  les  fonds  peut  s'expliquer  par 
cette  raison:  en  1866,  les  sommes  furent  votées  pour  envoyer  des  délégués  à  Ge 
nève,  tandis  que  cette  année  les  fonds  ne  sont  affectés  qu'aux  frais  d'administra 
tion. 

L'année  dernière,  comme  nous  l'avons  déjà  dit,  nous  avait  créé  des  dettes;  ces 

dettes,  le  Conseil  général  les  a  amorties  le  plus  qu'il  lui  a  été  possible. 

La  raison pour  laquelle  les  sociétés  adhérentes  n'ont pas  encore  payé  leurs  cotisa 
tions  et  pourquoi  d'autres  n'ont  pas  encore  voté  des  fonds  pour  le  Congrès  s'expli 
que  par la  stagnation  du  travail,  les  nombreuses  grèves,  les  lock-out  et  surtout par le 
mouvement  électoral,  puis  en  dernier  lieu  par  la  grève  des  tailleurs  de  Londres,  la 
quelle  absorbe  en  ce  moment  les  ressources  des  Trade's  Unions. 

Le  Conseil  général  a  reçu  de  nombreuses  lettres  de  sociétés  qui  constatent  cet 

état  de  choses  et  regrettent  de  ne  pouvoir  nous  aider  pécuniairement.

La  mission  du  Conseil  général  est  de  correspondre  avec  les  branches  individuelles 
dans  les  pays  où  des  lois  restrictives  empêchent  de  former  un  centre  d'action  avec 
sécurité :  telle  est,  par  exemple,  la  situation  de  la  France.

On  a  déjà vu  plus  haut  que  toutes  les  tentatives  ||14|  faites  par le  Conseil général, 
pour faire  entrer  en  France  les  carnets  contenant  les  Statuts  et Règlements  de  l'As 
sociation  internationale,  avaient  échoué  par  le  fait  de  l'autorité  française  qui  s'est 
emparée  de  notre  propriété  quand  aucun  motif ne  justifie  cette  violation  du  droit. 
Mais  les  entraves  apportées  par  l'administration  française  ne  s'arrêtèrent  pas  là.  Ce 
fut  en  vain  que  nos  correspondants  demandèrent  l'autorisation  de  faire  imprimer 
nos  Statuts  et  Règlements:  le  refus  le  plus  obstiné  fut  toujours  la  seule  réponse 
qu'ils  obtinrent.

Le  Comité  lyonnais,  qui,  en  1866,  avait  pu  avoir  des  réunions  de  plus  de 

500  membres,  ne  put,  après  le  Congrès  de  Genève,  obtenir  de  réunion  générale. 

10 

La  courageuse  persévérance  des  membres  lyonnais  auprès  des  agents  administra 
tifs  a  eu  pour résultat  de  démontrer  aux  plus  aveugles jusqu'à  quel  point  le  gouver 
nement  français  voulait  l'affranchissement  du  travailleur. 

Chose  remarquable  à  constater,  ces  entraves,  ces  tracasseries  mesquines,  n'ont 

pas  arrêté  un  instant  le  progrès  de  notre  association.

A  Neuville-sur-Saône,  une  de  nos  branches  a  fondé  une  Société  coopérative  de 
consommation  et  a,  par  ce  fait,  appelé  les  ouvriers  des  campagnes  à  la  pratique  de 
la vie  sociale,  chose  à laquelle  on  les  considérait jusqu'alors  comme  antipathiques.  20 

Notre  correspondant  de  Caen  nous  annonce  que  dans  cette  ville  l'union  des  tra 
vailleurs  s'affirme  chaque jour  davantage.  Grâce  à  cette  entente,  les  Bourreliers,  les 
Mécaniciens,  les  Tanneurs,  les  Selliers  et les  Forgerons,  etc.,  ont pu  obtenir la diminu 
tion  d'une  heure  de  travail  par jour,  sans  réduction  de  salaire. 

A  Fuveau  (Bouches-du-Rhône),  l'Association  internationale  compte  de  nom-  25 

breux  adhérents  parmi  les  mineurs,  dont  la  récente  grève  a  fait  tant  de  bruit. 

A  la  date  du  5  août  dernier,  le  Conseil  général  re||15|cevait  la  nouvelle  de  la  for 
mation  d'un Comité  à Fuveau  même.  Ce  résultat est  dû  à  la  courageuse  propagande 
du  citoyen  Vasseur,  membre  du  Comité  de  Marseille,  qui  nous  écrivait  le  21  juillet 
dernier:  «Une  lutte  est  engagée  entre  le  capital  et le  travail,  lutte  à  la  fois  triste  et  30 
comique :  d'un  côté  une  bande  d'administrateurs  et  d'employés  faisant  la  propa 
gande  en  voiture  pour  détourner  les  ouvriers  de  l'Association  internationale,  et  de 
l'autre  une  poignée  d'hommes  énergiques  et  de  dévouement,  luttant  sans  cesse 
contre  les  attaques  de  nos  adversaires  et  faisant  circuler  des  idées  d'indépendance 
et  de justice dans  les rangs  des  travailleurs. »  Puis  il ajoute  en terminant :  «Nul pou-  35 
voir  humain  ne  pourrait  arracher  les  idées  d'émancipation  que  nous  avons  jetées 
dans  le  pays,  car nos  adversaires  ont  à  combattre  deux  choses  bien  difficiles  à  vain 
cre :  le droit et la volonté. » 

En  résumé,  le  travailleur  comprend  que  vouloir  c'est  pouvoir,  et  qu'il  ne  doit 

compter  que  sur lui-même pour  son  complet  affranchissement politique  et  social.

Rapport  du  Secrétaire  correspondant pour la  Belgique  au  Conseil général 
de  l'Association  internationale  des  Travailleurs.

Citoyens, 

Ma  correspondance  avec  la  Belgique  date  de  la grève  des  vanniers.  J'écrivis  à  ce  su 
jet une  lettre  au  citoyen  Vandenhouten,  qui  a  paru huit jours  après  dans  la  Tribune du 
Peuple;  je  lui  donnais  avis,  au  nom  du  Conseil  général,  du  départ  de  Londres  d'un 
agent  des  patrons vanniers  pour embaucher  des  vanniers  belges; je  lui  disais  que  la 
puissance  de  notre  organisation  devait  déjouer  les  plans  de  cet  agent  et  que  la  soli 
darité  obligeait  les  ouvriers  belges  de  refuser tout  embauchage,  afin  d'assurer la vic 
toire  à  leurs  frères  anglais. 

15 

J'informai  ensuite  le  citoyen  Vandenhouten  du  rembarquement  des  quelques 
vanniers  belges  venus  à Londres  sur la foi  de  promesses  faites,  mais  non tenues  par  20 
les  patrons,  et  des  sentiments  fraternels  des  vanniers  anglais ;  je  faisais  ressortir 
dans  cette  lettre  combien  l'action  du  Conseil  général  avait  contribué  au  triomphe 
des  ouvriers  sur  les  patrons. | 

|18|  J'eus  avec  le  citoyen  Brismée  une  correspondance  au  sujet  de  l'impression  du 
compte-rendu  du  Congrès  de  Genève.  Cette  correspondance  ne  put  aboutir  à  rien, 
dans  ce  sens  que,  sur  l'avis  du  Conseil  général,  je  lui  demandai  un  crédit  qu'il  ne 
pouvait faire.  Ma  dernière  lettre  à  ce  sujet  resta  sans  réponse ;  sans  doute  il  en  coû 
tait  trop  au  citoyen  Brismée,  dont  le  dévouement  est  bien  connu,  d'être  obligé  de 
nous  refuser  formellement;  c'est  ainsi  que  j'interprète  son  silence. 

J'ai  envoyé  au  citoyen  Vandenhouten  une  lettre  du  Conseil  général  au  sujet  des 
cigariers  belges,  en  le  priant  de  donner  à  cette  lettre  toute  la  publicité  possible ; je 
fis  de  même  pour  les  résolutions  du  Conseil  général  au  sujet  de  la  visite  du  czar  à 
Paris.  J'ai  informé le bureau  de Bruxelles  de  la  décision  du  Conseil général  au  sujet 
de  la  grève  des  tailleurs  de  Londres,  recommandant  aux  tailleurs  belges  de  ne  point 
venir  à  Londres  pour  travailler  dans  les  ateliers  en  grève,  et  à  tous  les  ouvriers 
belges  de  faire  acte  de  solidarité  en  aidant  matériellement  les  tailleurs  de  Londres. 
J'ai  envoyé  à  Liège  au  citoyen  Dewitte,  faubourg  Saint-Gilles,  n°  6,  et  à Bruxelles 
au  citoyen  Vandenhouten  la  circulaire  du  Conseil  général  au  sujet  du  Congrès  de 
Lausanne,  avec prière  de  lui  donner la plus  grande  attention  et la plus grande  publi 
cité.

Enfin j ' ai  fait  tout  ce  que  le  Conseil  m'a  dit  de  faire  et j'ose  dire  que je  n'ai ja 
mais reçu  aucun  reproche  de  la  Belgique.  Je joins  à  ce  bref rapport  les  quelques  let 
tres  que j ' ai reçues.  Quant  aux frais  de  correspondance, j ' ai  cru  que je  pouvais  par 
faitement  faire  ce  petit  sacrifice  pour  l'Association.

|19|  A l l e m a g ne  et  Italie. 

L'Allemagne  est  encore  dans  un  état  anormal,  peu  favorable  au  développement  de 
notre  Association.  Cependant  le  citoyen  J.-Ph. Becker,  président  de  la  Section  alíe 
lo  mande  à Genève,  a réussi  à y fonder plusieurs branches,  sur lesquelles nous n'avons 

quant  à  présent  aucun  détail  particulier. 

En  Italie,  des  sociétés  ouvrières  sont  régulièrement  constituées  à  Naples,  Milan 
et  Gênes ;  nous  sommes  en  correspondance  avec  elles,  mais  aucune  cotisation  ne 
nous  est  encore  parvenue.

A m é r i q u e. 

En  Amérique,  deux  nouvelles  branches  ont  adhéré  à  l'Association  internationale ; 
nous  sommes  en  correspondance  avec  le  Labour  National  Union's  Committee  (So 
ciété  nationale  du  travail),  ainsi  qu'avec  le  président  de  VInternational Ironmoulders' 
Union  (Union  internationale  des  fondeurs  en  fer). 

Rapport  annuel  du  Secrétaire pour  l'Amérique, 
attaché au  Conseil général de  l'Association  internationale des travailleurs. 
(Septembre  1866  au  27  août  1867.) 

Le  premier  événement  qui  appartient  à  mon  ressort  après  mon  entrée  dans  la  posi 
tion  de  secrétaire  pour l'Amérique,  a été  l'arrivée,  en Angleterre,  du numéro pour le 
25  mois  de  septembre  1866  du  Ironmoulder's International Journal  (journal international 

des  mouleurs  en  fer),  publié  à Philadelphie  par W.-H. Sylvis,  en  même  temps  prési 
dent  de  Γ Union  internationale  des  mouleurs  en fer. 

Ce  numéro  contenait  un  rapport  étendu  du  premier  ||20|  Congrès  national  des 
travailleurs  des  Etats-Unis,  qui  venait  d'être  tenu  à  Baltimore  dans  le  courant  du 
30  mois  précédent.  Un  résumé  des  procès-verbaux  de  ce  Congrès  et  les  résolutions 
prises  ont  été  reproduits  dans  le  Commonwealth  (République)  de  Londres,  dans  le 
cours  d'octobre  1866.  Il ressortait  de  là  que  le  Congrès  de  Baltimore  avait  appris  la 
réunion prochaine  d'un  Congrès  analogue  des  travailleurs  de  l'ancien  monde  à  Ge 
nève  et  qu'il avait voté  à  l'unanimité  que la Commission  executive  de  Γ Union  natio-
naie  des  travailleurs,  organisée  par le  dit  Congrès,  était  autorisée  à  envoyer un  délé 
gué  au  Congrès  européen  des  travailleurs  pour  1867,  c'est-à-dire  à  Lausanne. 

35 

Par le même journal, j'appris  que  le  secrétaire pour l'étranger de  Γ Union  nationale 
des  travailleurs  était  un  citoyen  nommé  William  Gibson,  dont  l'adresse  aurait  été 

783 

Rapport du  Conseil  Général  de  l'A. I. T.  au  Congrès de  Lausanne (1867) 

New-Haven,  dans  le  Connecticut.  Ce  n'est  que  depuis  le  commencement  d'août  de 
cette  année  que j'ai  découvert  que  l'on  s'était  trompé  sur  l'adresse  du  citoyen  Gib 
son,  laquelle  est  Norwich  (Connecticut)  et  non  pas  New-Haven.  Cette  erreur  de  la 
part  des  compilateurs  du  rapport  du  Congrès  a  été  presque  fatale  aux  opérations  de 
mon  département. 

Au  reste, je n'essayai pas  à  l'instant d'entrer en  correspondance  avec  le  secrétaire 
Gibson,  parce  que je  pensais  que  le  début  de  cette  correspondance  devait  être  l'en 
voi  du  compte-rendu  officiel  des  transactions  du  Congrès  de  Genève.  Les  causes  du 
retard  de  la  publication  de  ce  rapport  ont  été  déjà  racontées  dans  le  compte-rendu 
général  du  Conseil général. 

Vers  décembre  1866,  le  citoyen  Orsini  s'approcha  du  Conseil  général  et  nous 
communiqua  les  noms  de  cinq  socialistes  européens  demeurant  à  New-York,  avec 
lesquels  il  nous  pria  d'ouvrir  une  correspondance.  Il  nous  pria  encore  de  leur  en 
voyer  des  pleins  pouvoirs  pour  agir  dans  l'intérêt  de  l'Association  dans  les  Etats-
Unis. 

Cinq  lettres,  accompagnées de  pleins  pouvoirs  dans  le  sens  indiqué,  ont été  expé 
diées  aux  cinq  citoyens  ||21|  nommés  par  Orsini,  mais  ni  moi  ni  le  Conseil  général 
nous  n'avons jamais  reçu  de  réponse  à  aucune  de  ces  lettres. 

Ainsi,  ma  première  ouverture  échoua.  Orsini,  du  reste,  a  fait  savoir  au  Conseil 
général  que  l'on  commençait  à  prendre  beaucoup  d'intérêt  à  notre  Association  à 
New-York  et  que  Wendell  Phillips,  le  grand  orateur abolitioniste  du  Massachusetts, 
avait  fait  l'offre  de  donner  des  conférences  au  profit  de  la  caisse  de  notre  Associa 
tion,  dès  que  l'on  lui  eut  montré  que  les  objets  et  les  chefs  de  l'Association  étaient 
dignes  de  ce  dévoûment. 

5 

10 

15 

20 

Orsini  ajouta  que  James  Stephens,  le  démocrate  et  patriote  d'Irlande,  s'était  fait 

25 

inscrire  à  New-York  au  nombre  des  membres  de  notre  Association. 

En  mars  1867,  le  compte-rendu  des  transactions  du  Congrès  de  Genève,  en  an 
glais,  commença de paraître  dans  l'International Courier,  de Londres.  Dès  que  quatre 
numéros  de  cette  série  eurent  paru,  c'est-à-dire  en  avril,  j'expédiai  ces  quatre  nu 
méros  de  l'International  Courier  à  quatre  personnes,  savoir :  une  série  au  secrétaire 
Gibson,  à  son  adresse  supposée ;  une  autre  série  à  W.-H. Sylvis ;  une  troisième  au 
rédacteur  de  la  Voice, journal  quotidien  publié  à  Boston  (Massachusetts)  et  dévoué 
aux  intérêts  des  ouvriers,  et  une  quatrième  au  rédacteur  du  Workingman's Advocate, 
de  Chicago  (Illinois),  l'organe  principal  des  ouvriers  des  Etats  occidentaux  de 
l'Union  américaine.  J'ai  accompagné  les  journaux  expédiés  au  secrétaire  Gibson 
d'une  lettre  qui exprimait la haute  importance  attachée par le  Conseil général à une 
intimité  de  rapports  et  à une  fréquence  de  communications  entre  lui  et  la  Commis 
sion  executive  de  l'Union  nationale  des  travailleurs. 

30 

35 

Cette  lettre  est  restée  sans  réponse  et je  n'ai  reçu  nul  accusé  de  la  réception  des 
journaux.  L'explication  très  simple  de  cet  insuccès  est  que  la  lettre  et  les journaux 
avaient  été  adressés  à  New-Haven  au  lieu  de  Norwich. 

40 

L'expédition  de  ces  documents  n'a  produit  qu'un  ||22|  seul  bon  résultat.  Le  ré 
dacteur  de  l'International Courier,  à Londres,  a  commencé  vers le mois  de mai de re 
cevoir  des  exemplaires  du  Workingman's Advocate,  de  Chicago,  et  un  échange  des 
deux  journaux  a  eu  lieu.  A  partir  de  cette  époque,  le  rédacteur  de  l'International  45 

784 

Rapport du  Conseil  Général  de  ΙΆ.Ι.Τ.  au  Congrès de  Lausanne  (1867) 

Courier, Joseph Collet,  a donné à ses lecteurs toutes les semaines des extraits des co 
lonnes  du  Workingman's Advocate,  de  Chicago. 

La  publication  du  compte-rendu  des  transactions  du  Congrès  de  Genève  a  été 

terminée  le  1er mai; j'expédiai  la  suite  de  ce  compte-rendu  aux  quatre  adresses  sus-

5  mentionnées. 

Des  extraits  de  ce  compte-rendu  ont  été  reproduits  dans  le  Workingman's  Advo 
cate,  de  Chicago.  Je  n'ai  aucun  moyen  de  savoir  si  l'un  ou  l'autre  des  deux  autres 
journaux  en  ont  inséré  des  extraits  ou  ont  fait  des  observations  à  son  égard. 

10 

Pendant  le  cours  du  printemps,  le  Conseil  général,  sur la  demande  du  bureau  de 
correspondance de Lyon,  s'est occupé de la question de  l'émigration  aux Etats-Unis 
d'un grand  nombre  des  tisseurs  en  soie  de  cette ville.  Le  bureau de  Lyon nous  avait 
appris  que  beaucoup  de  tisseurs  en  soie,  mécontents  de  leur  sort  chez  eux,  avaient 
envie  d'émigrer aux Etats-Unis  pour y  implanter leur  industrie.  Seulement,  ils  dési 
raient  savoir  si  quelques  capitalistes  américains  voudraient  avancer  les  frais  de 
15  voyage  et  de  premier  établissement.  Sur  ces  entrefaites,  le  Conseil  général  m'a 
chargé  d'écrire  à  ce  sujet  à  plusieurs  journaux  d'Amérique  et  à  plusieurs  hommes 
d'Etat.  J'obéis  à  ces  ordres ;  les  lettres  furent portées  en  Amérique  par un  Polonais, 
nommé  Koszek,  qui  partait  pour  New-York.  Point  de  réponse  encore  une  fois!  Je 
n'ai jamais  reçu  de  nouvelles  de  Koszek  depuis  son  départ. 

20 

En juin, j'ai  été  chargé  par le  Conseil général  d'écrire  à W.-H. Sylvis pour deman 
der  de  l'aide  pour  les  tailleurs  de  Londres  qui  s'étaient  mis  en  grève.  J'ai  écrit  le 
11  juin.  Je  saisis  cette  occasion  pour  exprimer  à  Sylvis  mon  chagrin  de  ce  que  je 
n'avais pas reçu un  ||23|  mot de réponse  du  secrétaire  Gibson.  Je le priai de me don 
ner  le  nom  et  l'adresse  d'un  autre  membre  du  Comité  de  l'Union  nationale  des  tra-

25  vailleurs. 

Sa  réponse,  datée  du  25  juin,  me  fit  part  des  raisons  pour  lesquelles  les  métiers 
en  fer américains  n'étaient pas  en  état  de  secourir  les  tailleurs  grévistes  de  Londres. 
Il  me  communiqua  également  le  nom  et  l'adresse  de  William-J.  Jessup,  de  New-
York,  un  zélé  promoteur  de  Y Union  nationale  des  travailleurs. 

30 

35 

Dès  que j'eus communiqué  cette  lettre  au  Conseil  général,  le Conseil me  chargea 
d'écrire  sans  retard  à William Jessup  pour lui  apprendre  la  date  du  Congrès  de  Lau 
sanne  et  pour  lui  dire  le  plaisir  que  le  Conseil  général  éprouverait  de  voir  à  Lau 
sanne  un  délégué  américain.  En  conséquence, j'écrivis  le  19 juillet.  Dans  ma  lettre 
je  racontai  les  circonstances  ayant  trait  à mes  efforts  impuissants  à  propos  du  secré-
taire  Gibson  et  en  même  temps  j'expédiai  à  Jessup  le  compte-rendu  officiel  du 
Congrès  de  Genève. 

A  cette  lettre j'ai reçu  une  réponse  datée  du  9  août.  Cette  réponse  constate  la  sa 
tisfaction  que  Jessup  a ressentie  du  projet  de  communiquer  avec  les  travailleurs  du 
continent  et  de  la  Grande-Bretagne.  Il  regrette  les  délais  qui  ont  eu  lieu  en  consé-
quence de la méprise,  quant à l'adresse du secrétaire Gibson. Il regrette aussi que la 
date  de  la réunion du  Congrès  de  Chicago  (le  19  août)  soit si rapprochée de  celle  du 
Congrès  de  Lausanne,  qu'il  sera  trop  tard  pour  qu'il  soit possible  d'envoyer un  délé 
gué  en  Europe.  Toutefois,  j ' ai  lu  récemment  un  article  du  Workingman's  Advocate 
de  Chicago  qui  déclare  que  la  question  d'envoyer  un  délégué  à  Lausanne  sera  une 
des  premières  qui  fixeront  l'attention  du  Congrès  de  Chicago.

Rapport du  Conseil  Général  de  l'A. I.T.  au  Congrès  de  Lausanne  (1867) 

Il  me  promet  de  communiquer  ma  lettre  du  19 juillet  au  Congrès  de  Chicago,  «à 
cause  de  son  importance»  et  d'expédier  au  Conseil  général  les  journaux  qui  con 
tiendront  le  meilleur  compte-rendu  des  procès-verbaux  du  Congrès  de  Chicago.  Il 
dit  qu'il  veut  continuer  sa  correspondance  avec  le  Conseil  général,  quand 
| 
|24|  même  il  ne  serait  pas  réélu  au  poste  de  vice-président  de  Y Union  nationale, 
parce  qu'il  est  encore  secrétaire  pour  la  correspondance  de  Y Union des travailleurs de 
New-York.  Il  accueille  ma  proposition  d'échanger  avec  lui  les  journaux  qui  sont  les 
organes  des  classes  ouvrières.  Tel  est un  abrégé  imparfait  de  sa  lettre  intéressante  et 
chaleureuse. 

5 

Au  commencement  de  ce  mois,  le  citoyen  Marx  m'a  remis  une  lettre  de  F.-A. 
Sorge,  qui  annonçait  la  formation  d'une  branche  de  notre  association  à  Hoboken, 
New-Jersey. 

10 

Vers  le  même  temps,  le  rédacteur  de  Y  International  Courier  de  Londres  m'a  mon 
tré  l'adresse  (en  brochure)  de  la  Commission  executive  de  Γ Union  nationale  des  tra­
vailleurs  aux  ouvriers  des  Etats-Unis,  à  l'effet  d'en  convoquer  les  représentants  au 
Congrès  de  Chicago.  Sur  la  couverture  de  cette  brochure  je  trouvai  le  nom  et 
l'adresse  en  manuscrit  du  secrétaire  William  Gibson,  et  alors  seulement je  compris 
que  j'avais  été  induit  en  erreur  à  l'endroit  de  son  adresse.  Je  déplore  la  perte  de 
temps  précieux  produite  par  cette  erreur.  Pour  me  consoler,  je  répète  le  proverbe : 
«Mieux  vaut  tard  que jamais!» 

15 

20 

Voilà  le  récit  de  mes  tentatives,  qui  n'ont  guère, jusqu'à  présent,  été  couronnées 
de  succès.  Toutefois,  je  laisse  les  choses  dans  une  position  pleine  de  promesses 
pour  l'avenir. 

Je  dois  toucher  maintenant  à  deux  autres  sujets. 
Les  efforts  des  ouvriers  américains  pour  se  conquérir  plus  de  temps  libre,  efforts 
qui  sont  connus  sous  le  nom  du  «mouvement  de  huit  heures»  fixèrent  l'attention 
du  Congrès  de  Genève.  Ainsi je  ne  crois  pas  déplacé  de  récapituler  très-succincte 
ment  ce  que je  sais  sur le  progrès  qu'on  a fait à  cet  égard  pendant les  derniers  douze 
mois.  L'agitation  a mûri  avec une  grande vitesse  et  a  trouvé  un  écho  immédiat  dans 
le  Corps  Législatif à  Washington  et  dans  les  assemblées  législatives  des  états  parti-  30 
culiers.  Dans  la  Chambre  des  députés  fédérale,  un  projet  de  loi  pour  les  huit  heu 
res  ||25|  concernant  les  travaux  entrepris  par  le  gouvernement  fédéral,  n'a  été 
ajourné  que  par  égalité  de  voix. 

25 

Plusieurs  des  législatures  d'Etats  ont  statué  que,  en  l'absence  d'un  contrat  spé 
cial,  le jour  de  travail ne  consiste  qu'en  huit heures.  Dans  l'Etat  de  New-York,  cette 
loi  a  été  votée,  mais  les  ouvriers  de  New-York  n'ont  pas  encore  osé  demander 
qu'elle  soit  exécutée.  Les  ouvriers  de  cet  Etat  se  sont  tout  récemment  réunis  dans 
un  congrès  spécial,  à  l'effet  de  délibérer  sur la  conduite  qu'ils  doivent  tenir  dans  ces 
circonstances.  Enfin  on  a  résolu  qu'une  demande  universelle  et  simultanée  pour 
l'exécution  de  la  loi  sera  faite  le  premier  novembre  prochain,  sans  réduction  de  sa- 
laire  si  possible,  mais  en  acceptant une  réduction s'il  est nécessaire.  La majorité  des 
délégués,  à  en juger  par  les  discussions,  manifestent  leur  assentiment  à  une  réduc 
tion  de  salaire. 

35 

40 

Dans  l'Etat  de  Californie,  on n'a pas  encore voté une  loi pour les  huit heures.  Né 
anmoins,  pendant  les  19  mois  qui  ont  précédé juillet  dernier,  le  système  des  huit

786 

Rapport du  Conseil  Général  de  l'A. I.T.  au  Congrès  de  Lausanne  (1867) 

heures  y  a  prévalu  en  effet.  Les  derniers  renseignements  de  cet  Etat  disent  que  les 
patrons  se  sont mis  en grève  contre le nouvel ordre  de  choses,  et qu'une grande  ces 
sation  de  travail  a  été  la  conséquence  de  ces  tentatives  réactionnaires. 

Je  suis  bien  aise  d'annoncer  au  Conseil  qu'à  partir  du  1er janvier  prochain,  l'af-
franchissement  d'une  lettre  ordinaire  sera  réduit  de  la  moitié,  c'est-à-dire  de  un 
shilling à six pence.  Je parle exclusivement des lettres échangées entre le Royaume-
Uni  et  les  Etats-Unis.  Un  traité  à  cet  effet vient  d'être  conclu  entre  les  deux gouver 
nements.

-  Remarques  générales.

10 

L'année  écoulée  depuis  le  dernier  Congrès  a  été  signalée  par  un  incessant  combat 
entre  le  capital  et  le  travail :  en  Amérique,  en  Angleterre,  en  France,  en  Belgique, 
les  grèves,  les  lock-out et  la  persécution  contre  les  travailleurs  ont  été  à  l'ordre  du 
jour. 

15 

Le  capital persécute le  travailleur avec  ténacité  et violence,  car il  sent  instinctive 
ment  que  le  jour  est  proche  où  le  travail  prendra  la  place  qui  lui  est  légitimement 
due. 

20 

Une  Société,  dans  les  Etats-Unis,  a  dépensé  70 000  dollars  pour défendre  le  droit 

à  la  vie  contre  les  envahissements  du  capital. 

En  Angleterre,  il  a  été  décidé  dans  les  Courts  of  Law  (cours  de  justice),  que  le  vol 
des  fonds des  Trade's  Unions  (unions  ouvrières)  n'était pas punissable.  Une  commis 
sion  d'enquête  officielle  sur les  Trade's  Unions  a  été  instituée  en vue  de  les  détruire 
ou  tout  au  moins  de  les  entraver. 

Le  dernier  procès  fait  par  les  patrons  tailleurs  de  Londres  aux  ouvriers,  la  con 
damnation  des  ouvriers  tailleurs  de  Paris,  le  massacre  des  ouvriers  mineurs  à  Mar-
chiennes  (Belgique),  sont  des  faits  qui  démontrent  clairement  que  la  société  n'est 
composée  que  de deux classes hostiles l'une  à l'autre,  les  oppresseurs  et les  opprimés, 
et  que  la  solidarité  entre  tous  les  travailleurs  du  monde  peut  seule  nous  donner l'af 
franchissement  intégral,  qui  est  le  but  que  poursuit  l'Association  internationale  des 
travailleurs.

Nous  terminons  par  ces  mots:  «Travailleurs  de  tous  les  pays,  unissons-nous!»

Citoyens, 

Le  plus  chaud  partisan  de  la  paix  perpétuelle,  c'est  incontestablement  le  travail 
leur ;  car  c'est  lui  que  le  canon  broie  sur le  champ  de  bataille,  c'est  encore  lui  dont 
le  travail et les veilles  alimentent le  budget  de  la guerre.  Donc,  à  ce  point  de vue,  il 
veut  la  paix,  mais  la  paix  n'est  pas  un  principe,  elle  ne  peut  être  qu'un  résultat. 

5 

Croyez-vous,  citoyens,  que  vous  pourrez  l'atteindre  par  le  moyen  qui  vous  a  été 

proposé  hier  en  créant  une  religion  nouvelle.  Non,  n'est-ce  pas ? 

Loin  d'en  créer une  nouvelle  la  raison  doit  détruire  celles  qui  existent.  Toute  re 

ligion  est  un  despotisme  qui  a  aussi  ses  armées  permanentes:  les  prêtres. 

Est-ce  que  ces  armées-là  n'ont  pas  fait  au  peuple  des  blessures  plus  profondes 
que  celles  qu'il  reçoit  sur  le  champ  de  bataille?  Si!  Ces  armées-là  ont  faussé  le 
droit,  atrophié  la  raison. 

10 

Ne  débarrassez  pas  les  casernes  pour  en  faire  des  églises.  Faites  table  rase  des 

deux. 

Maintenant,  abordons  un  autre  sujet:  la  suppression  des  armées  permanentes. 
Croyez-vous,  citoyens,  que  lorsque  ces  armées  seront  dissoutes  et  transformées  en 
milice  nationale,  nous  aurons  la  paix  perpétuelle ?  Non,  citoyens,  la  révolution  de 
juin  1848  est  là  pour  répondre.  Le  lendemain  du  combat,  les  gardes  nationales  fu 
sillaient  les  ouvriers  par  milliers. 

15 

Nous  le  reconnaissons  avec  vous,  l'abolition  des  armées  permanentes  est  un  20 

acheminement vers  ce  but,  mais  il  est  de  notre  devoir de  vous  dire  que  ce  n'est  pas 
assez. 

Les  Etats-Unis,  qu'un  grand  nombre  de  démocrates  nous  représentent  comme 
l'Eldorado  du  travail  et  de  la  liberté,  ne  peuvent  établir  la paix perpétuelle.  Les  der 
niers  événements  de  Chicago  le  démontrent  clairement,  pour  faire  exécuter  la  loi  25 
de  huit  heures  de  travail  votée  par  cet  Etat,  les  ouvriers  ont  été  obligés  d'en  venir 
aussi  aux  mains  avec  la  classe  bourgeoise. 

Pour  établir  la  paix  perpétuelle,  il  faut  anéantir  les  lois  qui  oppriment  le  travail, 

tous  les  privilèges,  et  faire  de  tous  les  citoyens  une  seule  classe  de  travailleurs. 

En  un  mot,  accepter  la  révolution  sociale  avec  toutes  ses  conséquences.

The  Address  and  Statutes  issued  by  the  Provisional  Central  Council  fully  explain 
the  Association's  objects  and  aspirations,  which,  however,  may  be  summed  up  in  a 
few  words.  It  aims  at  the  protection,  advancement,  and  complete  emancipation, 
economical  and  political,  of  the  Working  Classes.  As  a  means  to  this  great  end  it 
will  promote  the  establishment  of  solidarity  between  the  manifold  divisions  of  la­
bour  in  each  country,  and  the  co-operation  of the  Working  Classes  of  different  coun- 
tries. 

Its  Organization,  with  a  Central  Medium  at  London,  and  numerous  affiliated 
Branches  in  Europe  and  America,  will  assist  in  uniting  the  Working  Classes  of  all 
Countries  in  a  perpetual  bond  of fraternal  co-operation.  Annual  Congresses  of Del­
egates,  elected  by  the  affiliated  Working  Men  themselves,  will  create  for  the  Work-

Prospectus. 

The  object  of the  promoters  of the  above  Company  is  to  supply  a  great  want  of the 
age—to  establish  a  Newspaper  devoted  to  the  interests  of the  Working  Classes,  and 
to  secure  for  them  a  truthful  exponent  of their  wrongs,  and  a  faithful  champion  of 
their  rights. 

To  further  this  object,  the  Board  of  Directors  are  happy  to  state  that  they  have 
succeeded  in  purchasing  the  "Miner"  Newspaper,  which  is  now  incorporated  with 
the  "Workman's Advocate,"  and  they  have  also  made  arrangements  with  some  of the 
most  advanced  writers  to  contribute  to  its  columns. 

The  well-known  character  of the  men  connected  with  its  management  renders  it 
25  needless  to  indulge  in  professions.  Suffice  it  to  say,  that  it  will  be  Democratic  in 

Politics—and  ever  prepared  to  maintain  principle  against  expediency. 

To  those  who  have  been  accustomed  to  view  the  efforts  of the  poor  as  a  series  of 
vain  straggles  of Labour  against  Capital,  it  may  be  observed  that  those  efforts  have 

799 

The  Industrial  Newspaper  Company  (Limited).  Prospectus 

failed, not from a want of justice in the objects to be attained, but from the want of 
a legitimate  organ to  influence public opinion.  If an  Oxford Professor or an  enlight 
ened  writer  have  occasionally  come  forward  to  champion  the  creed  of  the  down 
trodden  millions,  his  voice  has  been  but  the  echo  of human  agony,  heard  amidst 
the  clamour  of  contending  interests,  and  silenced  by  the  diatribes  of  newspaper 
hirelings.  To say the Newspaper Press represents public opinion,  is  to administer in 
sult to  intelligent men.  It is  the  property  of speculators,  political  leaders,  large  con 
tractors,  and  railway  directors.  Can  we  expect  truth  through  the  channels  of false 
hood—light  from  the  regions  of darkness,  or  fairness  from  those  whose  business  it 
is to  calumniate, pervert,  and deceive?  Certainly not.  Hence the necessity for an or-  10 
gan  that  shall  be  beyond  the  taint  of corruption,  invulnerable  against  attacks,  and 
inspired  by  men  who  feel  it  is  their  mission  to  teach  the  truths  they  have  acquired 
by  hard  toil  and  bitter  suffering. 

5 

The  "Workman's  Advocate"  boldly  takes  its  stand  upon  this  necessity.  Dignified 
and  fearless,  as  becomes  the  champion  of the  masses,  it  requires  the  aid  of no  dis-  15 
honest  scribes  or  unprincipled  adventurers.  It  will  look  to  Labour  and  Labour's 
friends for its associates.  The  class that has produced  an Elliott,  Clare,  and Burns— 
that has given a Defoe to  fiction,  a  Stephenson to science,  and a  Shakespeare to lit 
erature, still claims within its ranks many a noble son who can wield the pen as well 
as  the  shuttle  or  the  hammer. 

20 

An  Industrial  Newspaper  Company  is  an  application  of the  Co-operative  princi 
ple—a  sign  of the  times  that  the  men  of  action  are  likewise  men  of thought,  who 
will  tell  their  own  "unvarnished  tale,"  in  an  organ  of their  own. 

On  the  great  questions  of the  day  the  Workman's Advocate  will  pronounce  a  de 

cided  opinion. With the view of promoting the  complete political and  social enfran-  25 
chisement  of  the  toiling  millions,  it  will  energetically  support  Manhood  Suffrage, 
vote  by ballot,  representation based  upon numbers,  direct taxation,  the  nationalisa 
tion  of the  land,  the  development  of co-operative  self-employment  to  national  di 
mensions,  reduction  of  the  number  of  the  hours  of  labour,  Saturday  half holiday 
movements, political,  international,  and trade associations,  everything that tends to 
advance  the  cause  of human  progress. 

30 

Originated by the  representatives  of Labour,  to the  sons  of Labour must it chiefly 
look for encouragement  and  support;  but  as  good  men  are  to  be  found  in  every  sta 
tion  of life,  it  is  believed  that  many  ardent  lovers  of freedom  who  have  means  at 
their  command,  will  derive  a  pleasure  in  co-operating  with  our  efforts.  Aid  from  35 
this  source will be  generous,  and  may be  gracefully  tendered,  as  it will be  gratefully 
received. 

Firm  in  the  faith  of those political  truths,  for the  utterance  of which  so  many  no 
ble  martyrs  have  suffered,  and  conscious  that  the  period  has  arrived  when  revolu 
tions  must  be  effected  by  mental  effort,  and  not  by  physical  violence,  the  conduc-  40 
tors  of the  Workman's Advocate  will  never  descend  to  scurrility  or vulgar  abuse,  but 
seek  to  prove  the justice  of its  claims  by  the  soundness  of its  arguments,  and  the 
charity  of its  spirit. 

Enrolling  amongst  its  literary  associates  some  of  the  brightest  intellects  of  all 

countries,  its  articles  upon  Foreign  Affairs  will  be  the  matured  opinions  of  pro-  45

found  thinkers;  and  from  its  close  connections  with  the  International  Working 
Men's  Association,  which  has  correspondents  in  all  parts  of the  world,  this  depart­
ment  will  be  one  of  its  most  valuable  features. 

Upon  domestic  topics  the  result  of the  week  will  be  faithfully  recorded  in  a  well-
5  written  Summary,  and  the  various  movements  of political  bodies  will  be  chronicled 

and  commented  fairly  on. 

On  all  questions  affecting  the  rights  of Labour  the  platform  will  be  its  own,  and 
every  working  man  will  feel  that  at  least  the  columns  of one journal  will  be  open  to 
him  and  those  who  advocate  his  cause. 

To  bring  the  proprietorship  of  the  Workman's  Advocate  within  the  reach  of  the 
masses,  the  Shares  are  being  issued  at  the  sum  of £1  each;  and  to  make  the  mode  of 
payment  as  easy  as  possible,  the  Directors  have  determined  to  accept  deposits  of 2s.

shall,  in  the  exercise  of the  powers  so  delegated,  conform  to  any  regulations  that 

30  may  be  imposed  on  them  by  the  Directors. 

67.—A  committee  may  elect  a  chairman  of their  meetings:  if no  such  chairman 
is  elected,  or  if he  is  not  present  at  the  time  appointed  for  holding  the  same,  the 
members  present  shall  choose  one  of their  number  to  be  chairman  of such  meeting. 
68.—A  committee  may  meet  and  adjourn  as  they  think proper:  questions  arising 
at  any  meeting  shall  be  determined  by  a  majority  of the  votes  of the  members  pres 
ent;  and  in  case  of an  equality  of votes,  the  chairman  shall have  a  second  or  casting 
vote.

69.—All  acts  done  by  any  meeting  of the  Directors,  or  of a  committee  of Direc 
tors,  or  by  any  person  acting  as  a  Director,  shall,  notwithstanding  that  it  be  after-
40  wards  discovered  that  there  was  some  defect  in  the  appointment  of any  such  Direc 
tors  or persons  acting  as  aforesaid,  or  that  they  or  any  of them were  disqualified,  be 
as  valid  as  if such person had  been  duly  appointed,  and  was  qualified  to  be  a  Direc 
tor.

71.—The  Directors  may,  before  recommending  any  dividend,  set  aside  out of the 
profits  of the  Company,  such  sum  as  they  think  proper  as  a  reserve  fund,  to  meet 
contingencies  or  for  equalising  the  dividends,  or  for  the  repairing  or  maintaining 
the  offices  connected  with  the  business  of the  Company,  or  any  part  thereof;  and 
the  Directors  may  invest  the  sum  so  set  apart,  as  a  reserve  fund,  upon  such  securi 
ties  as  they  may  select. |

A c c o u n t s.

the  Company;  of the  sums  of money  received  and  expended  by  the  Company,  and 
the  matter  in  respect  of which  such  receipt  and  expenditure  takes  place;  and,  of all 
credits  and  liabilities  of  the  Company:  the  books  of  account  shall  be  kept  at  the 
Registered  Office  of the  Company,  and,  subject  to  any  reasonable  restrictions  as  to

of  the  office,  salaries,  and  other  like  matters:  every  item  of  expenditure  fairly 
chargeable  against  the  year's  income  shall  be  brought  into  the  account,  so  that  a 
just  balance  of profit  and  loss  may  be  laid  before  the  meeting;  and  in  cases  where 
any  item  of expenditure  which  may  in  fairness  be  distributed  over  several  years  has 
been  incurred  in  any  one  year,  the whole  amount  of such  item  shall  be  stated,  with 
the  addition  of  the  reasons  why  only  a  portion  of  such  expenditure  is  charged 
against  the  income  of the  year. 

35 

78.—A  balance  sheet  shall  be  made  out  in  every  year,  and  laid  before  the  Com-  40 

812 

Articles  of the  Industrial  Newspaper  Company  (Limited) 

pany  in  general  meeting,  and  such  balance  sheet  shall  contain  a  summary  of the 
property  and  liabilities  of the  Company,  arranged  under  the  heads  appearing  in  the

tors  shall  be  appointed  by  the  company  in  general  meeting.

ble  as  an  auditor,  who  is  interested  otherwise  than  as  a  member,  in  any  transaction 
of the  Company;  and  no  Director  or  other  officer  of the  Company  shall  be  eligible 
during  his  continuance  in  office. 

15 

83.—The  election  of  auditors  shall  be  made  by  the  Company  at  their  ordinary 

meeting  in  each  year. 

84.—The  remuneration  of the  first  auditors  shall  be  fixed  by  the  Directors;  that

86.—The  auditors  shall  make  a  report  to  the  members  upon  the  balance  sheet 
and  accounts,  and  in  every  such  report,  they  shall  state  whether,  in  their  opinion, 
the  balance  sheet  is  a  full  and  fair balance  sheet  containing  the  particulars  required 
by  these  regulations,  and properly  drawn  up  so  as  to  exhibit  a  true  and  correct view 
of the  state  of the  Company's  affairs,  and  in  case  they  have  called  for  explanations

|1| Manchester S chiller-Anstalt, 
Carlton  Buildings,  Cooper  Street,  19  März,  1866. 

Die  „Schiller-Anstalt",  deren  nunmehr  sechsjähriges  Bestehen  den  vollen  Beweis 
liefert,  daß  sie  ein  Institut  ist,  welches  reellen  Bedürfnissen  entspricht,  muß  ihre 
jetzigen  Räumlichkeiten  mit  Juni  nächsten  Jahres  verlassen,  da  um  jene  Zeit  der 
mit  dem  Hausbesitzer  bestehende  Miethvertrag  verfällt  und  eine  Verlängerung  des 
selben  mit  Bestimmtheit  verweigert  worden. 

Das  Directorium  hat  folglich  die  Aufgabe  zu  lösen,  der Anstalt  die  Räume  zu  si 

chern,  die  ihren  Zwecken  entsprechen. 

Nachdem  alle  Schritte  zur Auffindung  eines  passenden  Gebäudes  gescheitert wa- 
ren,  und  auch  kein  Unternehmer  sich  finden  ließ,  der  ein  solches  herstellen  wollte 
um  es  der  Anstalt  in  Miethe  zu  überlassen  blieb  uns  kein  andrer  Weg  offen,  als 
der  -  zu  versuchen  ob  die  nothwendigen  Mittel  sich  aufbringen  ließen  um  den  Bau 
für  eigene  Rechnung  zu  unternehmen. 

5 

10 

Die  wesentlichen  Punkte,  die  wir  hierbei  im  Auge  behalten  mußten,  sind  fol- 

15 

gende: 

Die  Anstalt  muß  in  einem  centralen  Theile  der  Stadt  gelegen  sein. 
Sie  muß  den  Besuchern  schon  im  Erdgeschosse  zugänglich  sein. 
Die  einzelnen  Räume  müssen  wenigstens  den  jetzigen  an  Größe  gleichkom 
men. 

Die  Erfüllung  dieser  Bedingungen  erschien  uns  unumgänglich,  wenn  die  Anstalt 
gedeihlich  fortbestehen  soll.  Außerdem  aber  erschien  es  wünschenswerth,  den  ver 
schiedenen  in  Manchester  bestehenden  Vereinen  Gelegenheit  zu  bieten,  in  dem 
beabsichtigten  Neubau  ein  gemeinsames  Unterkommen  zu  finden.  Dieser  Zweck 
würde  erreicht werden, wenn der oberste  Stock zu  einem  Saal für 250 bis  300 Perso- 
nen  verwandt  würde.  Ein  solcher  Saal  würde  die  Kosten  des  Baues  nur  unbedeu 
tend  erhöhen  während  er  durch  Vermiethung  die  Einnahmen  der  Anstalt  vermeh 
ren  dürfte. 

20 

25 

Wir  haben  demgemäß  unsere  Bemühungen  dahin  gerichtet,  ein  passendes 

Grundstück  zu  finden  und  die  Kosten  des  ganzen  Unternehmens  zu  ermitteln. 

30 

818 

Zirkular  der  Manchester  Schiller-Anstalt vom  19. März  1866 

Folgendes  ist  das  Resultat,  zu  welchem  wir  gelangten: 

Kosten eines  Grundstückes von  etwa 
350  à  400  •  yards  Baufläche 
Kosten des  Baues 
Ergänzung  des Mobiliars 

£6000  à  £7000 
4000 
3 500  à 
500 
500  à 
Zusammen  £10000  à  £11500 

Wir  glauben  mit  Zuversicht  annehmen  zu  dürfen  daß  sich  auf  solchen  Grund 
und  Hausbesitz  eine hypothekarische Anleihe von £5000  à £6000  wird  erlangen  las 
sen  und  schöpfen  aus  dem  vergangenen  finanziellen  Gebahren  der Anstalt,  mit  Be-
rücksichtigung  der  voraussichtlichen  Mehr-Einnahmen  und  Ausgaben  die  volle 
Überzeugung,  daß  die  Zinsen  auf  eine  solche  Anleihe  bestimmt  aufgebracht  wür 
den. 

Es  ergiebt  sich  demnach,  daß  wir  zur  Verwirklichung  unseres  Planes  eines  eige 

nen  Capitals  bedürfen  würden  von  £5000  à  £5500.

Obgleich  die  Schiller-Anstalt  Mitgliedern  aller  Nationen  offen  steht  und  Nicht-
Deutsche  mehrfach  an  ihr  Theil  nehmen,  ist  sie  doch  ein  wesentlich  deutsches  In 
stitut. I

eine  Bibliothek, jetzt  aus  mehr  als  4000  Bänden  bestehend, 
ein  Lesezimmer  in  welchem  55  meist  deutsche  Zeitschriften  ausliegen, 
Vorträge  wissenschaftlicher  und  literarischer  Art,  namentlich  in  den  Special-
Vereinen  die  sich  zu  diesem  Behufe  innerhalb  der  Anstalt  gebildet  haben. 
Sie  trägt  also  nach  Vermögen  das  Ihrige  bei,  um  deutsche  Geistes-Cultur  zu  för-
dem,  und  bietet  ferner  in  ihren  Räumen  Gelegenheit  zu  geselligem  Verkehr,  der 
namentlich jenen Jüngern Ankömmlingen  aus  dem Vaterlande  zu  Gute  kommt,  die 
sonstiger  Anhaltepunkte  hierorts  entbehren. 

Wir  sind  der  festen  Überzeugung  daß  die  Anstalt  diesen  ihren  Zwecken  in  der 
Zukunft  noch  in  erhöhterem  Maße  wird  entsprechen  können,  wenn  die  Durchfüh-
rung  unseres  Planes  eine  Verbesserung  in  räumlicher  Beziehung  gestattet,  da  letz 
tere  eine  solche  in  finanzieller  Hinsicht  mit  herbeiführen  muß. 

Aus  dem  Gesagten  geht hervor,  daß  wir hauptsächlich  an  die  in  Manchester woh 
nenden  Deutschen  zu  appelliren  haben;  wir fragen  sie  ob  sie  zur Erreichung  der  an 
gedeuteten  Zwecke  die  nöthigen  Mittel  beischaffen  wollen. 

Um  die  Anstalt  nicht von vorn herein  mit  unerschwinglichen  Zinsen  zu  belasten, 
beschloß  das  Directorium  den  Versuch  zu  machen,  die  erwähnte  Summe  auf dem 
Wege  der  Schenkung  zusammen  zu  bringen,  um jedoch  dafür  zu  sorgen,  daß  das  zu 
errichtende  Gebäude  nur  für  die  Zwecke  der  Anstalt  verwandt  werden  könne, 
wurde  gleichzeitig  beschlossen,  daß  im  Falle  eines  Aufhörens  der  S  chilier-Anstalt 
die  Schenker für  den  Betrag  ihrer  Schenkungen  als  Gläubiger  der Anstalt  eintreten 
und  wird  dieß  in  den  Empfangsbescheinigungen  außdrücklich  anerkannt  werden. 
Sobald  die  Absicht  kund  geworden,  für  die  Anstalt  ein  eigenes  Gebäude  herzu 
stellen,  und  somit  ihr  Bestehen  zu  sichern,  wurde  unter  den  Mitgliedern  solch  rege 

819 

Zirkular der  Manchester Schiller-Anstalt vom  19. März  1866 

Theilnahme  dafür  wach,  daß  in  wenigen  Tagen  eine  Summe  von  nahe  an  £1200  -
in  Beträgen  von  £25  -  und  darunter  dem  Directorium  zur  Verfügung  gestellt 
wurde. 

Diese  gewiß  bedeutende  Summe  ist  wesentlich  das  Ergebniß  opferfreudiger  An 
strengungen  seitens  der Jüngern hier weilenden  Deutschen,  die  zugleich  auch  dieje- 
nigen  repräsentiren  welche  directen  Nutzen  aus  der  Anstalt  ziehen.

Gestützt  auf dieses  Resultat,  welches  den  Beweis  liefert,  daß  die  Anstalt  bereits 
jetzt  ein  Bedürfniß  für  eine  bedeutende  Zahl von  hiesigen  Deutschen  geworden  ist, 
wenden  wir uns  nun  an  diejenigen  welche  ein,  wenn  auch  entfernteres  Interesse  an 
einem Institute nehmen,  das  solche  Ziele  erstrebt,  und  das,  wenn es  erst einmal fest 
begründet  dasteht,  ein  Centraipunkt  aller  deutschen  Bestrebungen  in  Manchester 
zu  werden  bestimmt  scheint. 

Wir  wenden  uns  an  Sie  mit  der  Bitte  durch  Beibringung  der  Mittel  die  Ausfüh 

rung  unserer  Absichten  zu  ermöglichen. 

Das  Directorium  vertraut,  daß  zu  diesem  gemeinnützigen  Ziele  alle  deutschen 
Kräfte  Manchesters  mitwirken  werden.  Bloß  dadurch  kann  es  hoffen,  das  Werk  ins 
Leben  treten  zu  sehen,  und  darum  glaubt  es  sich  berechtigt,  dasselbe  mit  aller 
Wärme  zu  empfehlen.

Sir, 

I  Manchester,  8th  February,  1867. 

The  Shareholders  of the  "Manchester  Subscription  Library"  having  passed  a resolu 
tion  that  their  Company  is  to  be  dissolved,  the  stock  of books  has  been  advertised 
for  sale.  At  the  same  time  there  appears  to  be  a  desire,  on  the  part  of many  of the 
shareholders,  to  prevent  the  dispersion  of their  old-established  and  valuable  library. 
The  Directors  of  the  "Manchester  Schiller  Anstalt"  have  expressed  the  wish  to 
obtain  the  books,  with  the  object  of adding  them  to  their  own  library,  comprising 
about  6,000  volumes  of  mostly  new  books,  carefully  selected,  in  all  branches  of 
(chiefly  foreign)  literature.  If this  plan  can  be  realised,  not  only will  the  dispersion 
of the  Manchester  Subscription  Library  be  prevented,  but,  by  the  amalgamation  of 
the  two,  a  new  and  even  more  valuable  one  will  be  formed,  for  the  benefit  of  the 
Schiller Anstalt  and  of the  public  generally.  In  order  to  attain  this  object,  the  Com 
mittee  of  the  Manchester  Subscription  Library,  at  the  request  of  the  Directors  of 
the  Schiller Anstalt,  have  offered  their library  to  the  latter institution for the  sum  of 
£1,250,  which  offer  is  to  remain  valid  until  the  18th  instant.  Whilst  a  Sub-commit 
tee  of the  Directors  of the  Schiller  Anstalt  are  endeavouring  to  raise  whatever  they 
can  towards  that  sum,  this  appeal  is  made  to  the  Shareholders  of  the  Manchester 
Subscription  Library  with  a  view  of obtaining  their  co-operation. 

The  Rules  of the  Manchester  Schiller Anstalt,  of which  you  will  find  enclosed  a 
copy,  in  translation,  will  show you  that the  admission  to  the  institution,  and,  conse 
quently,  the  use  of the  library,  are  only  subject  to  the  payment  of a  yearly  subscrip 
tion of 30s.  Considering the  additional  advantages  offered,  the  increase  of 5s.  in  the 
yearly  subscription,  will  not  prevent  Shareholders  of the  Subscription  Library  from 
becoming  Members  of the  Schiller  Anstalt.  This  institution  (established  1859)  oc 
cupies  at  present  part  of Carlton  Buildings,  Cooper-street  (formerly  Mechanics'  In 
stitution),  but  there  is  every  prospect  of  its  being  soon  transferred  to  larger  and 
more  convenient  premises.  About  £3,000  has  already  been  subscribed  towards  a 
fund  for  the  erection  of  a  suitable  building,  and  naturally  due  consideration  will 
then  be  given  to  the  requirements  of the  increased  library. 

The  feeling  expressed  by  many  of the  Shareholders justifies  the  encouraging  ex 
pectation  that  the  only  value  they  attach  to  their  shares  consists  in  the  title  it  gives 
them  to  the  use  of their  library,  and  it  is,  therefore,  confidently  expected  that,  on 
this  advantage being secured to them,  they will consent to  |)  sacrifice the money val-
ue  of  their  shares,  thus  preserving  their  library  in  an  efficient  state,  and  transfer-

themselves. 

The  undersigned  gentlemen,  among  whom  you  will  find  members  of  the  Com 
mittee  and  Shareholders  of the  Manchester  Subscription  Library,  as  well  as  Direc

which,  from  the  subscriptions  already  obtained,  and  from  the  promises  of shares  by 
the  Proprietors  of the  Manchester  Subscription  Library  already  received,  they  feel 
confident  will  prove  successful. 

If,  as  they hope,  this proposal meets with  your  approval,  you will please  affix your 
signature  to  the  annexed  form,  by  which  you  will  present  your  share  to  the  Man 
chester  Schiller  Anstalt. 

As  it  is  necessary  to  arrive  at  a  final  decision  without  delay,  we  beg  you  to  favour 
us  with  your  reply  at  your  earliest  convenience  (if  possible  by  the  12th  instant), 
thereby  enabling  us  to  calculate  what  support  we  may  receive  at  the  hands  of the 
Shareholders  of the  Subscription  Library.

|1|  An  die  Herren  Unterzeichner  zum Fond für  den  Bau 
einer  neuen  Schiller-Anstalt. 

5 

Seit  die  im  vorigen  Jahre  vom  Directorium  zu  obigem  Zweck  eröffnete  Subscrip 
tion  durch  den  Krieg  und  die  Geschäftskrise  ins  Stocken  gerieth,  nachdem  £2875-
gezeichnet  waren,  haben  sich  die  Existenz-Bedingungen  der Anstalt  mit  Rücksicht 
auf den  beabsichtigten  Neubau  wesentlich  geändert.  Das  Directorium  hält  es  dem 
nach  für  seine  Pflicht,  den  Herren  Unterzeichnern  hierüber  die  erforderlichen  Auf 
klärungen  zu  geben. 

Da  die  gezeichnete  Summe  für  den  im  Circular  vom  19. März  1866,  dargelegten 
10  Bauplan  nicht  hinreichte  (es  waren  im  Ganzen  £5000  à  £5500  erforderlich),  auch 
unter  den  damaligen  Umständen  keine  Aussicht  vorhanden  war,  das  Fehlende 
rechtzeitig  zusammen  zu  bringen,  so  blieb  dem  Directorium  nichts  übrig  als  sich 
vorläufig  nach  einem  provisorischen  Local  umzusehen. 

Es  stellte  sich  heraus,  daß  ein  solches  im  Centrum  der  Stadt,  -  wo  es  nach  den 
15  Grundbestimmungen  der  Anstalt  liegen  soll  -  nicht  aufzufinden  war.  In  Folge  da 
von  war  das  Directorium  genöthigt  das  jetzige  Local  noch  bis  Juni  1868,  beizube 
halten,  was  aber  nur  gegen  Verdopplung  des  Miethbetrags  -  von  £ 2 2 5-  auf £450-
zu  erlangen  war. 

Unter  diesen  Umständen  war  die  Frage  nicht  länger  abzuweisen,  ob  es  denn 
20  wirklich  unumgänglich  sei,  daß  die  Anstalt  im  Centrum,  d. h.  im  eigentlichen  Ge 
schäftsbezirke  der  Stadt,  liege;  ob  nicht  bei  den  enorm  gestiegenen  Bodenpreisen 
und  Miethbeträgen  dieser  Vortheil  zu  theuer  bezahlt  werden  müsse;  und  ob  nicht 
eine,  dem Buchstaben  nach weniger  centrale  Lage,  z.B.  in  der Nähe  von All  Saints' 
Church,  bei  weit  geringeren  Kosten  in  der That  für  die  weit überwiegende  Mehrzahl 
der  die  Anstalt  benutzenden  Mitglieder  viel  centraler  und  bequemer  sei. 

25 

Nach  dem  im  vorigen  Jahre  entworfenen  Plan  würde  die  Anstalt,  selbst  wenn 
£5000-  durch  Schenkungen  zusammengebracht  wären,  noch  mit  einer  Hypothe 
karschuld von  £ 5 - 6 0 0 0-  also  mit  einer jährlichen  Zinsenlast von  £250  à  £300-  be 
schwert  sein.  Da  Grundstücke  im  Centrum  der  Stadt  aber  selbst  seit  vorigen  März 
im Werth  bedeutend  gestiegen  sind,  so  würde  der  damals  angeschlagene  Kaufpreis, 
die  zu  seiner  Bestreitung  nöthige  Hypothekar-Anleihe,  und  damit  die  Jahresbela 
stung  der Anstalt,  ebenfalls jetzt  höher  anzunehmen  sein.  Die  Bilanzen  der Anstalt 

30 

823 

Zirkular  der  Manchester  Schiller-Anstalt vom  28. Juni  1867 

in  den  beiden  letzten  Jahren,  lassen  nur  £200-  übrig  für  Hausmiethe.  Obwohl  in 
einem  besseren  Local  auf mehr  Mitglieder  zu  rechnen  wäre,  auch  gewisse  Neben 
einnahmen  in  Anschlag  gebracht  werden  müssen,  so  zeigt  sich  doch,  daß  die  obi 
gen  Zinsen  nur  eben  zu  erschwingen  sein  würden.  Jedes  Pfund  aber,  welches  für 
Hausmiethe  bezahlt wird,  wird den geistigen  Bildungsmitteln  der Anstalt entzogen.  Wir 
konnten  im  vorigen  Jahre  nur  £ 8 0-  für  Zeitschriften,  und  £ 2 0-  für  die  Bibliothek 
verwenden,  obwohl  die  Gesammteinnahmen  der  Anstalt  £500-  waren. 

5 

Ganz  anders,  wenn  das  Local  nach  der  Gegend  von  All  Saints  verlegt  wird.  Hier 
ist  unter  Anderen  ein  ganz  zweckentsprechendes  Grundstück  in  sehr  günstiger 
Lage,  für  £1700-  zu  haben,  auf welchem  außerdem  noch  £ 2 6-  Chief Rent  haften. 
Wir  legen  diesen  Bauplatz,  nur beispielsweise,  unserer  Berechnung  zu  Grunde. 

10 

Kaufpreis  des  Grundstücks  £1700  0  0 
Baukosten 
3500  0  0 
Erneuerung  des  Mobiliars 
500  0  0 
£5700  0  0 
Zusammen 

|2|  worauf  eine  Hypothekar-Anleihe  von  £2000-  wohl  sicher  zu  erlangen  sein 
würde.  Es  würden  in  diesem  Falle  also  die  Unterzeichnungen  zum  Baufond  nur  ca. 
£3500  à  £4000-  zu  betragen  haben,  also  £1000  à  £1500-  weniger  als  bei  einem 
Neubau  im  Centrum  der  Stadt.  Nach  dem  Erfolg  der vorjährigen  Zeichnungen und 
bei  den  veränderten Umständen  dürfen wir wohl hoffen,  den  noch fehlenden Betrag 
in  kurzer  Frist  aufzubringen. 

15 

20 

Die  finanzielle  Stellung  der Anstalt würde  sich  -  trotz  des  geringeren  Betrags  der 
erforderlichen  Schenkungen  -  wesentlich  heben.  Außer  der  Chief  Rent  £ 2 6-
würde  die  Anleihe  vom  £100-  zu  verzinsen  sein,  also  die  statt  Hausmiethe  in  An 
rechnung  kommende  Summe  nur  £ 1 2 6-  betragen,  statt £ 2 2 5-  die  voriges  Jahr  be-  25 
zahlt  wurden,  £450-  die wir jetzt  zahlen,  oder £250  à £300-  die  der vorjährige  Bau 
plan  in  Aussicht  stellte.  Es  könnten  also,  selbst  bei  den  Einkünften  des  vorigen 
Geschäftsjahrs,  statt  £100-,  £174-  jährlich  auf Bibliothek  und  Lesezimmer  der Anstalt 
verwandt,  die  dafür verfügbaren  Geldmittel  also fast verdoppelt werden.  Nun  ist  aber  si 
cher,  daß  durch  diesen  Neubau,  der Anstalt  in  vermehrter  Untermiethe  und  im  Zu- 
nehmen  der  Mitgliederzahl,  neue  Finanzquellen  eröffnet  würden,  deren  Ertrag 
auch  fast  ausschließlich  den  geistigen  Hülfsmitteln  der  Anstalt  zu  Gute  käme. 

30 

Wenn  die  Anstalt  wie  bisher  im  Centrum  der  Stadt  bleibt,  so  kommt  sie  selbst 
bei  £5000  à  5500-  Schenkungen  im  besten  Fall  nur  in  die  Lage,  knapp  ihre  Exi 
stenz  fristen  zu  können  und  wird  bei jeder  ungünstigen  Wendung  von  Neuem  ge-  35 
nöthigt  sein  an  das  deutsche  Publicum  Manchesters  zu  appelliren. 

Wird  sie  aber  nach  einer  Gegend  verlegt,  wo  Bauplätze  billiger  sind,  so  reichen 
£3500  à £4000-  Schenkungen hin,  ihr nicht  nur ein  für alle  Mal  eine  feste  Existenz 
zu  begründen,  sondern  auch  ihr  einen jährlichen  Ueberschuß  an  Einnahmen  zu  si 
chern,  der  ihr  endlich  erlaubt  ihren  besten  Zwecken  nach  allen  Seiten  hin  zu  genü-  40 
gen. 

Das  Directorium  konnte  unter  diesen  Umständen  nicht  zweifelhaft  sein  was  es 
zu  thun  hatte.  Es  entschied  sich  dafür,  die  Verlegung  nach  der  Gegend  von  „All 

824 

Zirkular  der  Manchester  Schiller-Anstalt vom  28. Juni  1867 

Saints"  und  die  damit  verknüpfte  Abänderung  der  Grundbestimmungen  in  Angriff 
zu  nehmen.  Es  berief  auf  den  6ten  Juni  eine  Generalversammlung,  welche  zahl 
reich  besucht  wurde  und  mit  allen  gegen  eine  Stimme  beschloß: 

„Die  Generalversammlung  erklärt  es  für  wünschenswerth,  daß  der  Art.  I.  der 

5  Grundbestimmungen  fernerhin  folgendermaßen  laute: 

,Es  wird  für  zweckmäßig  erklärt  hier  am  Orte  ein  literarisch-artistisches  Institut 

in  möglichst  centraler  Lage,  unter  dem  Namen  ,Schiller  Anstalt'  zu  begründen.' 
und  beauftragt  das  Directorium  die  durch Art. 7  der  Grundbestimmungen  und  § 20 
der  Statuten  bedingte  Abstimmung  vornehmen  zu  lassen." 

10 

In  Folge  dessen  hat  das  Directorium  die  nöthigen  Schritte  gethan  um  die  defini 

tive  Abstimmung  zu  veranlassen,  welche  Ende  August  stattfinden  wird. 

Es  ist  die  Frage  aufgeworfen  worden,  warum  man  nicht,  nach  einmal  beschlosse 
ner  Verlegung  der  Anstalt,  sich  nach  einem  Hause  umgesehen  habe,  welches  auf 
eine  Reihe  von  Jahren  miethweise  und  zu  einer  verhältnißmäßig  billigen  Miethe 
gesichert  werden  könne.  Das  Directorium  antwortet  hierauf,  daß  es  sich  nach 
einem  solchen  umgesehen,  aber  keines  gefunden  hat;  daß  ein  solches  auch  nur  in 
einer  vom  Centrum  der  Stadt  viel  weiter  entfernten  Lage,  als  die  von  „AU  Saints" 
anzutreffen  sein  dürfte;  daß  eine  solche  Lage  indeß  erst  im  äußersten  Nothfall  zu 
wählen  sein  würde,  und  endlich,  daß  selbst  in  diesem  Fall  mindestens  £1500  à 
£2000  in  Schenkungen  erforderlich  sein  würden,  um  den  immer  nöthigen  Ausbau 
und  die  neue  Einrichtung  eines  doch  nur  zeitweilig  sichern  Locals  herzustellen. 
Aus  diesen Gründen  ist  von  einem  solchen  Locai vor der Hand  abgesehen worden. | 
|3|  Das  Directorium,  im  Falle  die  nöthige  Majorität  zur  Abänderung  der  Grund 
bestimmungen  zu  Stande  kommt, -  woran  zu  zweifeln  es  keinen  Grund  hat  -  beab-
sichtigt: 

15 

20 

25 

Falls  der  hinreichende  Betrag  gezeichnet  wird,  ein  passendes  Grundstück  in  der 
Nähe  von All  Saints  anzukaufen,  darauf den  Bau  in  der  im  vorigen  Jahre  beabsich 
tigten  Ausdehnung  auszuführen,  nämlich  mit  Einrichtung  im  Keller  für  den  Turn 
verein,  und  mit  einem  großen  Saal  im  zweiten  Stockwerk,  wo  u. A.  die  Liedertafel 
30  Unterkommen  finden  könnte,  so  daß  die ursprüngliche Absicht  erreicht würde,  alle 

Deutschen  Vereine  Manchesters  unter  Einem  Dache  zusammenzubringen; 

Falls  dagegen  die  Beiträge  die  nöthige  Summe  nicht  erreichen  sollten,  sich  im 
Neubau  entsprechend  zu  beschränken,  jedenfalls  aber  nur  ein  solches  Gebäude 
herzustellen,  welches  den  Bedürfnissen  der  Anstalt  besser  entspricht  als  das jetzige 

35  Local. 

Das  Directorium  ersucht  Sie  von  vorstehenden  Veränderungen  des  Bauplans 
Kenntniß  nehmen  zu  wollen  und  zeigt  Ihnen  gleichzeitig  an,  daß  eine  Deputation 
aus  seiner  Mitte  die  Ehre  haben  wird  Sie  um  Ihre  Genehmigung  zu  ersuchen.
