"We  have  now  arrived  at the  commencement  of  the political millennium  in 
which  party-spirit  is  to  fly  from the  earth,  and genius,  experience, industry 
and  patriotism  are  to  be  the  sole  qualifications  for  office.  We  have  got  a 
Ministry which seems to command the  approval and support of men of every 
class  of  opinion.  Its  principles  command  universal  assent  and  support."

Such  are  the  words  with  which  The  Times,  in their  first  excitement  and 
enthusiasm,  have  ushered in the Aberdeen Administration.  From their tenor 
one  would  imagine  that  England is henceforth to be blessed with the  specta 
cle  of  a  Ministry,  composed  entirely of new,  young,  and promising charac 
ters,  and  the  world  will  certainly  be  not  a little  puzzled  when  it  shall  have 
learned  that the new era in the history of  Great Britain is to be inaugurated 
by  all  but  used-up  decrepit  octogenarians.  Aberdeen,  an  octogenarian; 
Lansdowne,  with  a  foot  already  in  the  grave;  Palmerston,  Russell,  fast 
approaching  a  similar  state;  Graham,  the  bureaucrat,  who  served  under 
almost  every  Administration  since  the  close  of  the  last  century;  other 
20  members  of  the  Cabinet—twice dead of  age  and exhaustion and only resus 
citated into an artificial existence; on the whole  a half  score of centenarians, 
such is  the  stock of which, by  a  simple sum of addition, the new millennium 
appears  to  have  been  made  up  by  the  writer  in  The  Times. 

In  this  millennium  then we  are  promised the  total disappearance  of party 
25  warfare, nay even of parties themselves. What is the meaning of  The Times ? 
Because  certain  portions  of the Aristocracy have hitherto enjoyed the privi 
lege  of  assuming  the  appearance  of  national  or  parliamentary  parties,  and 

3 

Karl  Marx 

have  now  come  to  the  conclusion  that the  farce cannot be  continued for the 
future,  because,  on  the  ground  of  that  conviction  and  in  virtue  of the hard 
experiences  lately  undergone,  these  aristocratic  coteries  mean now  to  give 
up  their  little quibbles and to combine into one compact mass for the preser 
vation of their common privileges—is the existence of all parties to cease from 5 
this  hour?  Or  is  not  the  very  fact  of  such  a  "coalition"  the  most  explicit 
indication  that  the  time  has  arrived  when  the  actually  grown-up  and  yet 
partially unrepresented fundamental classes of modern society, the industrial 
bourgeoisie  and  the working class,  are  about to  vindicate  to  themselves  the 
position of the  only political parties  in the  nation?

The  Tories,  under  the  Administration of  Lord Derby,  have once for  ever 
denegated  their  old  Protectionist  doctrine  and  professed  themselves  Free 
traders.  The  Earl  of  Derby,  on  announcing  the  resignation  of  his  Cabinet, 
said:  " I, My Lords, remember, and probably your Lordships will remember, 
that the noble  Earl  (Aberdeen) has, upon more than one occasion,  declared  15 
in this house that, the question of free trade excepted, he knew of none upon 
which  there  was  any  difference  between  himself  and  the  present  Govern 
ment."  Lord  Aberdeen,  in confkming this  statement, goes  still further in his 
remarks:  "He was ready to unite with the noble Earl (Derby) in resisting the 
encroachments of Democracy, but he was at a loss to  see where this Democ-  20 
racy existed." On both sides it is granted that there is no longer any difference 
between  Peelites  and  Tories.  But  this  is  not  all.  With  regard  to  the  foreign 
policy, the  Earl of Aberdeen observes:  "For thirty years, though there have 
been  differences  in  execution,  the  principle  of  the  foreign  policy  of  the 
country  has  never  varied."  Accordingly, the whole  struggle between Aber-  25 
deen  and  Palmerston,  from  1830  till  1850,  when  the  former  insisted  on  the 
alliance  with  the  Northern Powers,  and the  latter on the  "entente  cordiale" 
with  France,  when the  one  was  against and the other for Louis Philippe, the 
one  against  and  the  other  in  favor  of  intervention;  all  their  quarrels  and 
disputes,  even their  late  common  indignation  on  Lord  Malmesbury's  "dis-  30 
graceful"  conduct  of  the  foreign  affairs—all  this  is  confessed  to  have  been 
mere humbug.  And yet, is there anything in the political relations of England 
that  has  undergone  a  more  radical  change  than  her  foreign  policy?  Up  to 
1830—alliance  with  the  Northern  Powers;  since  1830—union  with  France 
(quadruple  alliance);  since  1848—complete  isolation  of  England  from  the  35 
whole  Continent. 

Lord Derby having first assured  us  that there exists no difference between 
Tories and Peelites, the Earl of Aberdeen further assures us that there is also 
no  difference  between  Peelites  and  Whigs,  Conservatives  and  Liberals.  In 
his opinion:  "The country is tired of distinctions without meaning, and which  40 
have  no  real  effect  on the  conduct or principles  of  public men.  No  Govern-

4 

A  Superannuated  Administration—Prospects  of the  Coalition  Ministry,  etc. 

ment  is  possible  except  a  Conservative  Government,  and  it  is  equally  true 
that  none  is  possible  except  a  Liberal  Government." 

"These terms had no  very definite meaning. The country was  sick of these 

distinctions  without  meaning." 

5 

10 

15 

20 

The  three  factions  of  the  Aristocracy,  Tories,  Peelites  and  Whigs,  con 
sequently  agree,  that they possess  no  real  marks  of  distinction.  But there is 
still  another  subject  on  which  they  agree.  Disraeli  had  declared  that it was 
his  intention  to  carry  out the  principle  of  Free Trade.  Lord  Aberdeen  says: 
"The  great object of  trte  Queen's  present ministers, and the great character-
istic  of their  Government would be the  maintenance  and prudent extension 
of  Free  Trade.  That  was  the  mission  with  which  they  were  peculiarly  en 
trusted."  In  a  word,  the  entire  Aristocracy  agree,  that the  Government has 
to  be  conducted for the benefit, and  according to the  interests of the middle-
class, but they  are  determined  that  the  bourgeoisie  are  not to be themselves 
the  governors  of  this  affair;  and  for  this  object  all  that  the  old  Oligarchy 
possess  of talent,  influence  and  authority  are combined, in a last effort, into 
one  Administration,  which  has  for  its  task  to  keep  the bourgeoisie,  as  long 
as  possible, from the direct enjoyment of governing the nation. The coälized 
Aristocracy  of  England  intend,  with regard  to  the  bourgeoisie,  to  act on the 
same  principle  upon  which  Napoleon  I  professed to  act in reference to  the 
people:  "Tout pour  le  peuple,  ríen  par  le  peuple.  " 

"There  must,  however,"  as  Ernest  Jones  observes  in  The People's Paper, 
"be  some  disguise  to  the  evident  object  of  excluding the  middle-class,  and 
this they (the ministers) hope is  afforded by an admixture in subordinate and 
25  uninfluential  places  of  aristocratic  Liberals,  like  Sir  William  Molesworth, 
Bernal  Osborne,  etc.  But  let  them  not  imagine  that this  dandified Mayfair-
Liberalism  will  satisfy the  stern  men of  the  Manchester  school.  They  mean 
business, and nothing less. They mean pounds, shillings, pence—place, office, 
and the gigantic revenues  of the largest empire  of the  world,  placed with all 
its  resources  subservient  to  the  disposal  of  their  one  class-interest." 

30 

Indeed,  a  glance  at  The  Dally News,  The Advertiser,  and more particularly 
The  Manchester  Times,  that  direct  organ  of  Mr. Bright,  is  sufficient  to 
convince  any  one,  that  the  men  of  the  Manchester  school,  in provisionally 
promising their  support to the Coalition Government, intend only to observe 
the  same  policy  on  which  the  Peelites  and Whigs had  acted  in reference  to 
the  late  Derby  Cabinet;  i.e.  to  give  ministers  a fair trial.  What the  meaning 
of  a  "fair  trial"  may  be,  Mr. Disraeli  has  recently  had  occasion  to  learn. 

The  defeat of  the Tory  Cabinet having been  decided by the Irish Brigade, 
the  new  Coalition-Government,  of  course,  considered  it  necessary  to  take 
steps  for  securing  the  Parliamentary  support of  that party.  Mr. Sadleir, the 
broker  of  the  brigade,  was  soon  seduced  by  a  Lordship  of  Treasury. 

35 

40 

5 

Karl  Marx 

Mr. Keogh had the offer of the Irish Solicitor-Generalship, while Mr. Monsell 
was  made  Clerk  of  Ordnance.  "And  by  these  three  purchases,"  says  The 
Morning Herald,  "the  brigade  is  supposed  to  be  gained."  However,  there  is 
ample  reason for doubting the effectuality of these  three purchases  in  secur 
ing  the  adhesion  of  the  entire  brigade,  and  in  The  Irish  Freeman's  Journal 
we actually read : "This is the critical moment for Tenant Right and Religious 
Liberty.  The  success  or  failure of these questions  depend not now on minis 
ters,  but  on the  Irish members.  Nineteen votes  have  overthrown the Derby 
Administration. Ten men, by walking from one  side to the other, would have 
altered  the  event.  In  this  state  of  parties  the  Irish  members  are  omni- 
potent." 

5 

io 

At  the  conclusion  of my last letter I had  stated it as my opinion, that there 
was  no  other  alternative but that of  a Tory  Government or  a Parliamentary 
Reform.  It  will  interest  your  readers  to  become  acquainted  with  Lord 
Aberdeen's  views  on  the  same  subject  He  says:  "The improvement of the  15 
condition  of  the people  could not exclude  (sic!) the amendment of the repre 
sentative  system;  for unquestionably,  the  events  of the last election had not 
been  such  as  to  render  any  man  enamoured  of  it."  And  at  the  elections 
consequent  on  their  acceptance  of  office,  Lord  Aberdeen's  colleagues  de 
clared  unanimously,  that reforms  in the  representative  system  were  called  20 
for;  but in  every instance they gave their audiences to understand, that such 
reforms  must  be  "moderate  or  rational  reforms,  and  made  not  rashly,  but 
deliberately  and  with  caution."  Consequently  the  more  rotten  the  present 
representative  system  turns  out  and  is  acknowledged  to  be,  the  more  de 
sirable  is  it that it  should  be  altered  neither  rashly  nor  radically. 

25 

On  the  occasion  of the  late réélections  of  Ministers  there  has  been  made 
a first trial of a new invention for public men to preserve their character under 
all  circumstances,  whether  out or  in.  The  invention  consists  in  a  hitherto 
unpracticed  application  of  the  "open  question. "  Osborne  and  Villiers  had 
pledged themselves  on former  occasions  upon the  ballot.  They now declare  30 
the  ballot  an  open  question.  Molesworth  had  pledged  himself  to  Colonial 
Reform—open question.  Keogh,  Sadleir, etc., were pledged on Tenant Right-
open  question.  In  a  word,  all  the  points  which  they  had  always  treated  as 
settled,  in  their  quality  of  members,  have  become  questionable  to  them  as 
Ministers. 

35 

In  conclusion  I  have  to  mention  another  curiosity,  resulting  from  the 
coalition  of Peelites, Whigs, Radicals and Irishmen.  Each of their respective 
notabilities  has been turned  out of that department for which alone they were 
supposed  to  possess  some  talent  or  qualification,  and  they  have  been  ap 
pointed  to  places  wondrously  ill-suiting  them.  Palmerston,  the  renowned  40 
Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs,  is  appointed  to  the  Home  Department,  from 

6 

A  Superannuated  Administration—Prospects  of  the  Coalition  Ministry,  etc. 

which  Russell  has been removed,  although grown old  in that office,  to  take 
the  direction  of  Foreign  Affairs.  Gladstone,  the  Escobar  of  Puseyism,  is 
nominated  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer.  Molesworth,  who  possessed  a 
certain  reputation  for  his  having copied  or  adopted  Mr. Wakefield's  absurd 
5  colonization  system,  is  appointed  Commissioner  of  Public  Works.  Sir 
Charles Wood, who as  a Minister of Finances, enjoyed the privilege of being 
upset  either  with  a deficit or a  surplus  in the  treasury,  is entrusted  with the 
Presidentship of the Board of Control of Indian Affairs.  Monsell, who hardly 
knows  to  distinguish  a rifle  from  a musket,  is made  Clerk of Ordnance. The 
10  only  personage  who  has  found his  proper  place,  is  Sir  James  Graham,  the 
same  who,  in  the  capacity  of  First  Lord  of  the  Admiralty,  has  already  on 
a  former  occasion,  gained  much  credit for having first introduced the rotten 
worm  into  the  British  Navy.

Political  Prospects—Commercial  Prosperity-
Case  of  Starvation. 

Correspondence  of  The  N.Y.Tribune. 

London,  Friday, Jan. 14,  1853. 

Lord  John  Russell,  in  receiving the  diplomatic  body,  at the  Foreign Office, 
told them that he  held the  seals of that Department ad interim only,  and that 
in no great length of time the Foreign Office would be transferred to the Earl 
of  Clarendon.  The  fact  is,  that  Russell  has  always  been  a perfect  foreigner 
in  the  Foreign  Department,  in  which  he  never  made  himself  conspicuous, 
except  by  an  insipid  compilation  on  the  history,  I  believe,  of  the  treaties 
concluded  since  the  time  of  the  peace  of  Nymwegen,  a  book  which,  to 
confess  the  truth,  is  at least as  entertaining  as  the  "tragedy"  with which the 
same  Russell  once  surprised the world.  Lord John will, in all probability, be 
entrusted  with  the  Leadership  of the  House  of Commons,  with  a seat in the 
Cabinet, where  his  entire activity is likely to be absorbed in framing the new 
Reform  Bill.  Parliamentary  Reform  is  Russell's  traditionary  field  of  action, 
since,  by  his  measures  in  1831,  he  proved  such a masterly hand in dividing 
the  rotten  boroughs  between  Tories  and  Whigs. 

My  predictions  on  the  probable  inefficiency  of  the  three  Irish  purchases 
made by the  Ministry for  securing the enlistment of the  whole "Brigade" in 
the  cause  of  the  Coalition  Government,  have  already  been  fulfilled  to  the 
very  letter.  The  attitude  of  The Freeman 's Journal and  The  Tablet—the tenor 
of  the  letters  and  declarations  of Messrs.  Lucas, Moore,  and Duffy—lastly, 
the resolution adopted against Messrs.  Sadleir and Keogh, at the last meeting 
of  the  Tenant-Right  Association,  sufficiently  indicate  that  the  Aberdeen 
Administration will only dispose of a very small fraction of the Irish troops. 

It  is  known  that  Lord  Aberdeen,  the  Chief  of  the  Cabinet,  will  take  his 
seat in the House  of Lords.  Now,  Mr. Bright, in  a speech recently delivered 

8 

Political  Prospects—Commercial  Prosperity—Case  of  Starvation 

at  a  banquet  at  Manchester  to  your  new  Ambassador,  Mr. Ingersoll,  has 
seized  an  opportunity to  explain how the total  suppression of the  House  of 
Lords  is  the  conditio  sine  qua  non for  the  "advancement"  of  the  industrial 
middle-class.  This  first  official  declaration  of  the  Manchester  school  since 
the  formation  of  the  Coalition  Ministry  will  do  something  toward enabling 
Lord  Aberdeen  in  discovering  where  that  Democracy,  so  much  redoubted 
by  Lord  Derby,  exists. 

Thus  the  party  warfare  declared  to  have  been  abolished  for  ever,  by  a 
sanguine  writer  in  The  Times,  has  already  burst  forth,  notwithstanding  that 
the  era of the "Millennium" had opened with the adjournment of Parliament 
until  the  10th  of  February.

The continuation and increase of the commercial, and industrial prosperity 
has  been  loudly  and  unanimously  proclaimed  at  the  beginning of the  New-
Year,  and confirmed by the publication of the revenue accounts  down to the 
15  5th  inst.,  by  the  returns  of  the  Board  of  Trade  for  the  month,  and the  11 
months  ending  Dec. 5,  1852,  by  the  reports  of  the  Inspectors  of  Factories, 
and lastly by the  annual trade circulars issued at the commencement of every 
New-Year,  and  giving  a  general  survey  of  all  the  commercial  transactions 
of  the  past  year. 

20 

The  Revenue  Returns  show  a total  increase  on the  year of £978,926, and 
on  the  quarter  of  £702,776.  There  is  an  increase  in  every  item  on  the  year 
with  the  exception  of  Customs.  The  total  sum  placed  into  the  Exchequer 
amounted  to  £50,468,193. 

The  Excise,  which  is  supposed  to  indicate  the  well-being 

25  of  the  people,  amounted to 

in  the  year  ending  Jan. 5,  1852. 
In  the  year ending Jan. 5,  1853,  it  amounted  to

Consequently,  there  is  an increase  of nearly £1,000,000 on the month, and 
upward of £2,000,000 on the  eleven  months.  Yet,  in the  absence  of all value 
of  the  imports, we  know  not  how far  it  is  met or  surpassed by the increased 
value  of  the  latter. 

Passing  to  the  reports  of  the  Inspectors  of  Factories,  Mr.  Horner,  Inspector  5 

for the Lancashire District, in his report on the half year ending Oct. 31,1852, 
which  has  just  been  published,  writes  as  follows: 

"In my district, very little change has taken place in the last year as regards 
woolen,  worsted  and  silk  factories,  and  flax  mills  remain  as  they  were  on 
the  1st  of  November,  1851.  But  the  increase  in  cotton mills  has  been  very  10 
large.  After  deducting those  which  are  at present unoccupied (and  many of 
them  will,  in  all  probability,  be  soon  again  at  work,  especially  those  from 
which  the  machinery  has  not  been  removed,)  there  have  been  set  to  work 
in the  last two  years  129  new  mills,  with an aggregate  of 4,023 horse power; 
and  there  have  been  53  instances  of  additions  to  existing  mills,  with  an  15 
aggregate  of  2,090  horse  power,  so  that there  has  been an increase  of 6,113 
horse  power,  which  must  have  given  employment  to  probably  not  fewer 
than 24,000 additional hands in the cotton trade. Nor is this all ; for many new 
mills  are  at present being built.  In the limited area which includes the towns 
of  Ashton,  Staleybridge,  Oldham  and  Lees,  there  are  eleven,  which  it  is  20 
estimated will have  an aggregate power of  620 horses. The machine-makers 
are  said  to  be  overwhelmed  with  orders;  and  a  very  intelligent  and  ob 
serving  mill-owner  told  me  lately  that  many  of  the  buildings  now  going up 
would  in  all  probability  not be  at  work before  1854,  from  the  impossibility 
to  get machinery to them.  But the above returns and those that will be given  25 
by  my  colleagues  on  the  present  occasion,  however  they  may  indicate  a 
great  increase,  still  they  by  no  means  give  the  whole;  for  there  is  a  large 
and  very  fertile  source  of  increase  of productions of which it would be very 
difficult  to  obtain  any  account.  I  allude  to  the  modern  improvements  in 
steam-engines,  by  which  old  engines  and even new engines  are made to do  30 
an  amount  of  work far  beyond  their  nominal  horse  power,  and  to  an  extent 
formerly  believed  to  be  impossible." 

Mr. Horner  then  quotes  a  letter  from  the  eminent  civil-engineer,  Mr. 
Nasmyth,  of  Birmingham,  describing  the  gain  of  power  by  working  the 
engines  at  greater  speed,  and by  adapting to them the high-pressure  double  35 
cylinders  of  Woolf,  the  result  of  which  is,  that  at least fifty per  cent,  more 
work  is  done  by  the  identical  engines  still  in use  than was  done before the 
improvement. 

It  appears  from  a  summary  of  the  reports  of  all the Inspectors, that in the 
year  ending  Oct. 31,  1852,  the  total  number  of  new  factories  occupied  was  40 
229,  with  a  steam power  of  4,771  horses,  and a water-power of 586 horses, 
and  the  addition  to  existing  factories  amounted  to  69,  with  a  steam  power 

10 

Political  Prospects—Commercial  Prosperity—Case  of  Starvation 

of  1,532  horses,  and  a  water-power  of  28  horses,  making  a  grand  total  of 
6,917  horse  power. 

Passing  next  to  the  annual  trade  circulars, we find  them  all breathing the 
same  enthusiastic  style  in  which  The  Times predicted  the  political  millen-
5  nium,  and  having  at  any  rate,  this  advantage,  that  they  are  based  on facts 

and  not  on  mere  expectations,  as  far  as  they  refer  to  the  past  year. 

The  agricultural  interest  has  no  cause  for  complaint.  On  the  opening  of 
the  year  the  weekly  average  price  of  wheat was  37s 2d;  at  the  close  of the 
year  it  has  reached  45s l i d.  The  rise  in  the  prices  of  grain  has  been  ac-

10  companied by  a  rise  in the  price  of  cattle,  meat,  butter  and  cheese. 

15 

20 

In August,  1851, an unprecedented fall in the prices of produce was known 
to  have taken place,  chiefly in the  prices  of  sugar  and coffee,  and it did  not 
cease  with  that  year,  for  the  panic  in  Mincing  Lane  did  not  reach  its  hight 
till  the  first  month  of  the  past  year.  The  annual  circulars  indicate  now  a 
considerable  advance  in  the  prices  of  most  articles  of  foreign production, 
especially  of  Colonial  produce,  sugar,  coffee,  etc. 

As  to  the  movement  in raw  materials  it will be  seen from  the following: 
"The  state  of the  Wool trade"  is described in Messrs.  Hughes  & Ronald's 
circular,  "as  having  been  throughout  the  past  year  in  the  highest  degree 
satisfactory  . ..  The home demand for wool has been unusually l a r g e . .. The 
export  of  woollen  and  worsted  goods  has  been  on  a  very  extensive  scale, 
even exceeding the year  1851, the highest rate ever before attained... Prices 
have  been  steadily  looking up, but it is  only during the  last month, that  any 
decided  advance  has  taken  place,  and  at present they  may be quoted, on the 

25 average, about 15 to 20 per cent, above the corresponding period last year. " 

30 

35 

"The  Wood  trade,"  say  Messrs.  Churchill  &  Sim,  "has  largely  partaken 
in  the  commercial prosperity of  the country during  1852... The importation 
into  London  exceeded  1,200  cargoes  during  1852—closely parallel  to  1851. 
Both  years  were  50 per  cent,  in advance  of those  preceding,  which average 
about 800 cargoes. While the quantity of hewn timber  stands at the average 
of  several  years;  the  use  of deals, battens, etc.; or the  sawn wood, has taken 
an  immense  start  during  1852,  when 6,800,000  pieces  replaced the  previous 
average  of  4,900,000  pieces." 

With regard  to  Leather,  Messrs.  Powell  &  Co.  say: 

"The  year  just  concluded  has  doubtless been a favorable one for leather 
manufacturers  in  almost  every  department.  Raw  goods,  at  the  com 
mencement  of  the  year,  were  at  low  rates,  and  circumstances  have  taken 
place  which  have  given  leather  an  increased  value  in a greater  degree  than 
for  several  past  years." 

40 

The  Iron  trade  is  particularly  flourishing,  the  price  of  iron having  risen 
from  £5  per  tun  to  £1010s  per  tun;  and  more  recently  to  £12  per  tun,  with 

11 

Karl  Marx 

the  probability  of  a  rise  to  £15,  and  more furnaces  continually  coming  into 
operation. 

Of  the  Shipping,  Messrs.  Offor  &  Gamman,  say: 
"The  year just  closed  has  been  of  remarkable activity to British shipping, 
chiefly  caused  by  the  stimulus  given  to  business  by  the  gold  discovery  in 
Australia  . ..  There  has  taken  place  a  general  rise  in  freights." 

The  same  movement  has  taken place  in the  Ship-building department.  In 
reference  to  this  branch,  the  circular  of  Messrs.  Tonge,  Curry  &  Co.,  of 
Liverpool,  contains  the  following: 

"On  no  occasion  have  we  been  able  to  report  so  favorably  for  the  year 
past of  the  sale of  ships  at this port—both of the amount of tunnage  sold, and 
the prices that have been obtained; prices of Colonial  ships  having advanced 
fully  17  per  cent.,  with  a continuing  tendency  upwards;  while  stocks  have 
been  reduced  to  48  sail  against  76  in  1852,  and  82  in  1851,  without  any 
immediate  supplies being expected...  The number of vessels that have come 
into  Liverpool  within  the  year  and  sold,  is  120;  equal  to  50,000 tuns.  The 
number of  ships launched, and in course of construction, in our port this year, 
is  39,  computed  at  15,000  tuns,  against  23,  computed  at  9,200  in  1851.  The 
number  of  steamers  built,  and  in  the  course  of  construction  here,  amount 
As regards  iron built  sailing vessels,  the  most 
to  13,  equal to  4,050 tuns 
remarkable feature of our trade is the very increasing favor they are growing 
into,  and  which  are  now  occupying  the  builders  both  here,  in  the  Clyde, 
New-Castle  and  elsewhere,  to  an  unprecedented  extent." 
As  regards  railways,  Messrs.  Woods  &  Stubbs  write: 
"The  returns  exceed  the  most  sanguine  expectations,  and far  outstrip  all 
previous  calculations.  The  returns  for  last week  show  an increased  mileage 
over  1851  of 348  miles, or  5V2 per cent.,  and  an increased traffic of £41,426, 
or  14  per  cent." 

Lastly,  Messrs.  Du Fay  &  Co.'s  Circular  (Manchester) records  the  trans 
actions with India and China for the month of December,  1852, as extensive, 
and  the  abundance  of  money  alluded  to  as  having  favored  undertakings  to 
distant  markets,  and  as  having  enabled  those  interested  in them to  make  up 
for  losses  sustained  in  the  early  part  of  the  year  on  goods  and  produce. 
"Various  new  land,  and  mining,  and  other  schemes  attract  speculators  and 
capitalists  just  now." 

The prosperity  of  the  manufacturing districts  in general, and particular of 
the  cotton  districts,  has  been  shown  from  the  reports  of  the  Inspectors  of 
factories.  In  reference  to  the  cotton  manufacture,  Messrs.  John Wrigley  & 
Son,  of  Liverpool,  have  the  following: 

"Viewed  as  a  test  of  the  general  prosperity  of  the  country,  the  progress 
of  the  cotton-trade,  during  the  year  now  closed,  affords  results  the  most 

12 

Political  Prospects—Commercial  Prosperity—Case  of Starvation 

gratifying  . ..  It  has  presented  many  striking features, but none more promi 
nent  and  noteworthy  than  the  extreme  facility  with  which  so  unpre-
cedentedly  large  a crop  as  upward of  3,000,000 of bales,  the produce  of  the 
United  States  of  America,  has  been disposed of...  Preparations are  making 
in  many  districts  for  an  extension  of  manufacturing  powers,  and  we  may 
expect  a  larger  aggregate  quantity  of  cotton  to  be  worked  up  during  the 
approaching  year  than  any  previous  one." 

Most other  branches  of industry are in the  same position.  "We refer,"  say 
Messrs.  McNair,  Greenhow  &  Irving  (of  Manchester),  "to  Glasgow  as 
connected  with  its  cotton  and  iron  manufacture;  to  Huddersfield,  Leeds, 
Halifax,  Bradford,  Nottingham,  Leicester,  Sheffield,  Birmingham,  Wolver 
hampton etc., as  connected with their various productions—all  seem in a high 
state  of  prosperity." 

The  only  exceptions  to  the  general  prosperity  are  the  silk-trade  and  the 
wool-combers in Yorkshire;  and the general aspect of trade may be resumed 
in  the  words  of  a  Manchester  circular:  " O ur  a p p r e h e n s i o ns  a re  t h o se 
of  o v e r - s p e c u l a t i o n,  rather  than  of  inactivity  and  want  of  means." 

In the midst of this universal prosperity, a step recently taken by the Bank 
of  England  has  raised  a general consternation among the commercial world. 
On  the  22d  of  April,  1852,  the  Bank  of  England  had  lowered  the  rate  of 
discount to  2 per cent.  On the  morning of January 6,1853,  notice  was given 
that  the  discount  would  be  raised  from  2  to  272 per  cent,  an increase  in the 
charges  of  25  per  cent.  Attempts  have  been  made  to  explain  this  increase 
by  the  large  liabilities  contracted  lately  by  some  extensive  railway  con 
tractors,  whose  bills  are  known  to  be  afloat  in  heavy  amounts.  In  other 
quarters  it  was  believed,  as  for  instance  by  The  London  Sun,  that  the  Bank 
of England intended, in their turn, to take advantage of the existing prosperity 
by  increasing  discounts.  On  the  whole,  the  act  has  been  reprobated  as 
"uncalled for." In order to appreciate it in its true light, I subjoin the following 
statements  from  The  Economist:

There is, accordingly, a million of gold more in the Bank than in April, 1852, 
when  the  rate  of  interest  was  reduced  to  2  per  cent.,  but  the  difference  is 

13 

Karl  Marx 

very  marked  between  the  two  periods;  for  it  has  changed  in  regard  to  the 
movements  of gold  from a flowing to an ebbing tide. The efflux is peculiarly 
powerful,  from  its  overbearing  all  the  imports  from  America and  Australia 
of  the  last  month.  Besides,  securities  were  five  and  a half  millions  less  in 
April  than  at  present.  Consequently,  in April,  1852,  the  supply  of  loanable 
capital  was  larger  than  the  demand,  while  now  the  reverse  is  the  case. 

5 

The  emigration  of  bullion  was  accompanied  by  a  marked  decline  in  the 
foreign  exchanges,  a  circumstance  which  must  be  accounted  for,  partly by 
the  considerable  advance  in  the prices  of most  articles  of  import, partly by 
the large  speculations  in imports.  To this must be added the influence of the  10 
unfavorable  autumn and  winter on farmers,  the  consequent doubts and fears 
respecting the next harvest, and, as  a result of the latter, immense operations 
in  foreign  grains  and  farines.  Lastly,  English  capitalists  have  very  largely 
engaged  in  the  formation  of  railway  and  other  companies  in  France,  Italy, 
Spain, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany and Belgium, and partake very  15 
much  in  the  general  swindle  now  going  on  at  the  Paris  Bourse.  Paper  on 
London  is  therefore  more  abundant  in  all  markets  of  Europe  than  at  any 
former  period,  in  consequence  of  which  there  has  been  a  continued  fall in 
the  rate  of  Exchanges.  On  July  24th the  Exchange  on Paris  was  25 f.  30 c. 
for the  pound  sterling;  on the  1st of January it had fallen to 25 francs.  Some  20 
transactions  have  even  been  made  below  25  francs. 

In  so  far  as  the  demand  for  capital  has  increased  in  proportion  to  the 
supply,  the  late  measure  adopted  by  the  Bank  of  England,  appears  to  be 
perfectly justified.  In so far as it was intended to put a check upon speculation 
and  upon  the  emigration  of  capital,  I  venture  to  predict,  that  it  will  be  25 
thoroughly  ineffectual. 

Your  readers  having  accompanied  us  to  such  a  length,  through  all  the 
testimonials  of  the  growing  prosperity  of  England,  I  request  them  to  stop 
a  moment  and  to  follow  a poor  needle  maker,  Henry  Morgan, who  started 
out  from  London,  on  his  journey  to  Birmingham,  in  search  of  work.  Less  30 
I  should be  charged with exaggerating the  case,  I give  the  literal  account of 
The  Northampton  Journal. 

" D e a th  f r om  D e s t i t u t i o n . — C o s g r o v e — A b o ut  nine  o'clock  on  the 
morning  of  Monday,  two  laboring  men,  while  seeking  shelter from the  rain 
in  a  lone  barn,  occupied  by  Mr.T. Slade,  in  the  parish  of  Cosgrove,  were  35 
attracted  by  groans,  which  were  found  to  come  from  a  poor  man,  lying  in 
a  heap  hole,  in  a  state  of  extreme  exhaustion.  They  spoke  to  him,  kindly 
offering him  some  of  their  breakfast, but without receiving any answer;  and 
upon  touching  him,  found  his  body  almost cold.  Having fetched  Mr. Slade, 
who  was near by, this gentleman, after  some time had elapsed, sent him, by  40 
a  boy,  in  a  cart,  with  a  bed  and  covering  of  straw,  to  the  Yardley-Gobion 

14 

Ç 

Political  Prospects—Commercial  Prosperity—Case  of  Starvation 

union-house  about  a mile  distant,  where  he  arrived just before  one  o'clock, 
but  expired  a  quarter of  an hour afterward.  The famished, filthy, and ill-clad 
condition  of the poor creature presented a most frightful spectacle. It appears 
that  this  unhappy  being,  on  the  evening  of  Thursday,  the  2d,  obtained  a 
5  vagrant's  order for a night's lodging at the Yardley-house, from the relieving 
officer  at  Stony  Stratford,  and,  having  then  walked  to  Yardley,  a  distance 
of three miles and upward, was accordingly admitted ; he had food given him, 
which  he  eat heartily,  and begged to  be  allowed  to  remain the  next day  and 
night, which was granted,  and upon leaving on Saturday morning early, after 
10  his  breakfast  (most likely his  last meal in this world,)  took the road back to 
Stratford.  It is probable that, being weak and footsore, for he had abad place 
on one  heel,  he  was  soon glad to  seek the first friendly  shelter he could find, 
which  was  an  open  shed,  forming  part  of  some  outfarming-buildings,  a 
quarter of  a mile from the turnpike-road. Here he was found lying in the straw 
15  on  Monday, the 6th, at noon,  and, it not being wished that a stranger should 
remain  on  the  premises,  he  was  desired  to  go  away.  He asked  leave  to  stay 
a little longer,  and went off  about four o'clock,  once  more to  seek at nightfall 
the nearest place of rest and shelter, which was this lone barn, with its thatch 
partly  off,  with  its  door left  open,  and in  the  coldest possible  situation,  into 
the  heap-hole  of  which  he  crept,  there  to  lie  without  food  for  seven  days 
more,  till  discovered,  as  has  been  described  above,  on  the  morning  of  the 
13th. This ill-fated man had given his name as Henry Morgan, a needlemaker, 
and  appeared between  thirty  and forty  years  of age,  and in person,  a good-
framed  man." 

20 

25 

It  is  hardly possible  to  conceive  a more  horrible case.  A  stalwart,  strong-
framed  man,  in  the  prime  of  life—his  long  pilgrimage  of  martyrdom  from 
London  to  Stoney-Stratford—his  wretched  appeals  for  help  to  the  "civiliza 
tion " around  him—his  seven  days fast—his brutal abandonment by his fellow 
men—his  seeking  shelter  and  being  driven  from  resting-place  to  resting-
30  place—the crowning inhumanity of the  person named Slade  and the patient, 
miserable  death of  the  worn-out  man—are  a picture perfectly  astonishing to 
contemplate. 

No  doubt he  invaded  the  rights  of  property, when he  sought shelter in the 

shed  and  in  the  lone  barn!!! 

35  Relate  this  starvation  case  in  midst  of  prosperity,  to  a  fat  London  City  man, 
and  he  will  answer  you  with  the  words  of  The  London  Economist  of 
Jan. 8th: 

"Delightful is it thus to  see, under Free Trade, all classes flourishing; their 
energies  are  called  forth  by  hope  of  reward;  all improve their  productions, 

40  and  all  and  e a ch  are  benefited."

The  réélections  consequent  upon the  new  ministerial  arrangements  are  fin- 
ished.  Ministers  have  suffered  a  defeat,  Mr. Sadleir,  one of the Lords of the 
Treasury,  and  hitherto  considered  the  chief  of  the  "Irish  Brigade,"  having 
been  beaten  by  Mr. Alexander,  who  was  elected by  a majority  of  six  votes. 
Mr. Alexander  owes  his  election  to  a  coalition  of  the  Orangemen  and  the 
Catholics.  On  the  other  hand,  Ministers  were  victorious  at  Oxford  Uni- 
versity,  where  the  poll  lasted  fifteen  days  and  the  struggle  was  extremely 
animated.  Gladstone  carried  the  day  by  a  majority  of  124  against  Dudley 
Perceval,  the  candidate  of  the  High Church Party.  To amateurs of Hudibra-
sian  logic  we  can recommend the  leaders  of the two  contending journals  in 
this  struggle,  The  Morning  Chronicle  and  The Morning Herald.

Yesterday, after  a long debate, the Directors of the Bank of England again 
raised the minimum rate of discount from 2V2 to 3 per cent. This circumstance 
had  an  immediate  effect upon  the  Paris  Bourse, where  all  sorts of securities 
had to  submit to  another decline.—But if the Bank of England should succeed 
in  checking  speculation  at  Paris,  there  will  remain  open  another  outlet for  20 
the  drain  of  bullion:  the  imports  of  corn.  The  last  harvest  both  in England 
and  on  the  Continent  is  estimated  at  one-third below the  average.  Besides, 
there  exists  some doubt as to the quantity of food available for consumption 
until  next  harvest,  in  consequence  of  the  delay  in  sowing  the  seed  caused 
by  the  wet  state  of  the  soil.  Therefore,  large  imports  of  grain are  arranged  25 
for,  and  will  continue  to  keep  the  course  of  exchange  unfavorable  for 
England.  The  gold-ships  from  Australia  cannot  keep  pace  with  the  sudden 
augmentation  of  grain  imports.

Elections—Financial  Clouds—The  Duchess  of  Sutherland  and  Slavery 

In  one of my late  letters  I mentioned the  speculation going on in iron.  The 
first raising of  the  rate  of discount,  by the  Bank,  from  2  to 2V2 per cent,  had 
already  had  its  effect  upon  this  branch  of  trade.  Scotch  Pigs,  for  the  last 
fortnight  selling  at 78s,  on the  19th inst.  dropped  down to  61s.  The  Railway 
5  Share  market,  too,  will  probably  be  depressed,  since the raising of the  rate 
of  interest,  by  forced  sales  of  shares  hitherto  deposited  as  securities  for 
loans,  and  the  commencement of these  operations  has  already  taken place. 
My opinion, however, is that the drain of bullion is not caused by exportation 
of gold  alone,  but that the  brisk home trade, especially in the manufacturing 

10  districts,  has  a full  share  in it. 

15 

During  the  present  momentary  slackness  in  political  affairs,  the  address 
of  the  Stafford  House  Assembly  of  Ladies  to  their  sisters  in  America upon 
the  subject of  negro-slavery,  and  the  "affectionate and Christian address of 
many  thousands  of  the  women  of  the  United  States  of  America  to  their 
sisters, the women of England," upon white slavery, have proved a god-send 
to  the  press.  Not  one  of  the  British  papers  was  ever  struck by the  circum 
stance  that  the  Stafford House  Assembly took place at the palace  and under 
the  Presidency  of  the  Duchess  of  Sutherland, and yet the names of Stafford 
and  Sutherland  should  have  been  sufficient to  class  the  philanthropy of  the 
20  British  Aristocracy—a philanthropy  which chooses its  objects  as  far  distant 
from  home  as  possible,  and rather  on that  than on this  side  of the  ocean. 

25 

The  history  of  the  wealth  of  the  Sutherland  family  is  the  history  of  the 
ruin  and of the expropriation of the  Scotch Gaelic population from its native 
soil.  As  far  back  as  the  tenth  century,  the  Danes  had  landed  in  Scotland, 
conquered  the  plains  of  Caithness,  and  driven back the  aborigines  into the 
mountains.  Mhoir-Fhear-Chattaibh, as he was called in Gaelic, or the "Great 
Man  of  Sutherland,"  had  always  found  his  companions  in  arms  ready  to 
defend him at the  risk  of their lives  against all his  enemies,  Danes  or  Scots, 
foreigners  or  natives.  After  the  revolution  which  drove  the  Stuarts  from 
30  Britain,  private  feuds  among  the  petty  chieftains  of  Scotland  became  less 
and  less  frequent,  and the  British  Kings,  in order  to  keep  up  at least a  sem 
blance  of  dominion  in  these  remote  districts,  encouraged  the  levying  of 
family regiments  among the  chieftains,  a  system  by which these lairds were 
enabled  to  combine  modern  military  establishments  with  the  ancient  clan 
system  in  such  a manner  as  to  support  one  by  the  other. 

35 

Now, in order to distinctly appreciate the usurpation subsequently carried 
out,  we  must  first  properly  understand  what  the  Clan  meant.  The  Clan 
belonged  to  a  form  of  social  existence  which,  in  the  scale  of  historical 
development,  stands  a full  degree below the feudal state; viz., the patriarchal 
state of  society.  „Klaen, " in Gaelic, means children. Every one of the usages 
and  traditions  of  the  Scottish  Gaels  reposes  upon  the  supposition  that  the 

40 

19 

Karl  Marx 

members  of  the  clan  belong  to  one  and  the  same family.  The  "great man," 
the  chieftain of the  clan, is on one hand quite as arbitrary, on the other quite 
as  confined  in  his  power,  by  consanguinity, etc.,  as every father of a family. 
To the clan, to the family, belonged the district where it had established itself, 
exactly  as  in Russia, the land occupied by a community of peasants belongs, 
not  to  the  individual  peasants,  but  to the community.  Thus  the  district was 
the  common property of the family.  There could be  no more question, under 
this  system,  of private property, in the modern sense of the word, than there 
could  be  of  comparing  the  social  existence  of  the  members  of  the  clan  to 
that  of  individuals  living  in  the  midst  of  our  modern  society.  The  division 
and  subdivision  of  the  land  corresponded  to  the  military  functions  of  the 
single  members of the clan.  According to their military abilities, the chieftain 
intrusted to  them  the  several  allotments,  cancelled or  enlarged  according to 
his  pleasure  the  tenures  of  the  individual  officers,  and  these  officers  again 
distributed to their vassals  and under-vassals every separate plot of land. But 
the  district at large  always  remained the property  of the clan,  and, however 
the claims of individuals might vary, the tenure remained the  same ; nor were 
the  contributions  for  the  common  defense,  or  the  tribute  for the Laird, who 
at  once  was  leader  in  battle  and  chief  magistrate  in  peace,  ever  increased. 
Upon the  whole,  every plot  of  land  was cultivated by the  same family, from 
generation  to  generation,  under  fixed  imposts.  These  imposts  were  in 
significant,  more  a  tribute  by  which  the  supremacy  of the  "great man "and 
of  his  officers  was  acknowledged,  than a rent of  land  in a modern  sense,  or 
a  source  of  revenue.  The  officers  directly  subordinate  to  the  "great man" 
were  called  "Taksmen, "and the  district intrusted to their care,  "Tak.  " Under 
them  were  placed  inferior  officers,  at  the  head  of  every  hamlet,  and  under 
these  stood  the  peasantry. 

Thus  you  see,  the  clan  is  nothing  but  a  family  organized  in  a  military 
manner,  quite  as  little  defined  by  laws,  just as  closely hemmed in by tradi 
tions,  as  any  family.  But  the  land  is  the  property of the family,  in  the  midst 
of  which  differences  of  rank,  in  spite  of  consanguinity,  do  prevail  as  well 
as  in  all  the  ancient  Asiatic  family  communities. 

The  first usurpation took place,  after  the  expulsion of  the  Stuarts,  by  the 
establishment  of the  family  Regiments.  From  that moment, pay became the 
principal  source  of  revenue  of  the  Great Man,  the  Mhoir-Fhear-Chattaibh. 
Entangled  in  the  dissipation  of the  Court of  London,  he tried to  squeeze  as 
much money as possible out of his officers, and they applied the same system 
to  their  inferiors.  The  ancient  tribute  was  transformed  into  fixed  money 
contracts.  In  one  respect  these  contracts  constituted  a progress,  by  fixing 
the  traditional  imposts; in another respect they were a usurpation, inasmuch 
as  the  "great  man"  now  took  the position of landlord toward the  "taksmen" 

20

15 

20 

who  again took toward the peasantry that of farmers. And as the "great man" 
now  required  money  no  less  than the  "taksmen,"  a production not only for 
direct  consumption  but for export and exchange  also became  necessary; the 
system  of  national  production  had  to  be  changed, the  hands  superseded  by 
this  change  had  to  be  got  rid  of.  Population,  therefore,  decreased.  But that 
it as  yet was  kept up  in  a certain manner,  and that man,  in the  18th century, 
was  not  yet  openly  sacrificed  to  net-revenue,  we  see  from  a  passage  in 
Steuart,  a  Scotch  political  economist,  whose  work  was  published  10  years 
before Adam Smith's, where it says (vol. 1 chap. 16): "The rent of these lands 
is  very  trifling  compared  to  their  extent,  but  compared  to  the  number  of 
mouths  which  a  farm  maintains,  it will perhaps  be  found that  a plot of land 
in the  highlands  of  Scotland  feeds  ten  times  more  people  than  a farm of the 
same  extent in the richest provinces." That even in the beginning of the  19th 
century the rental imposts were very small, is shown by the work of Mr. Loch 
(1820),  the  steward  of  the  Countess  of  Sutherland,  who  directed  the  im 
provements  on  her  estates.  He  gives  for  instance the rental of the Kintrada-
well  estate  for  1811,  from  which it appears that up to then, every family was 
obliged  to  pay a  yearly  impost of  a few  shillings  in money,  a few fowls, and 
some  day's  work,  at  the  highest. 

It was  only  after  1811  that the ultimate  and real usurpation was enacted, 
the  forcible  transformation  of  clan  property into  the  private property,  in  the 
modern  sense,  of  the  Chief.  The  person  who  stood  at  the  head  of  this  eco 
nomical  revolution,  was  a  female  Mehemet  Ali,  who  had  well digested her 
Malthus—the  Countess  of  Sutherland,  alias  Marchioness  of  Stafford. 

25 

Let  us  first  state  that  the  ancestors  of the  Marchioness  of  Stafford were 
the  "great  men"  of  the  most  northern  part of  Scotland,  of very near three-
quarters  of  Sutherlandshire.  This  County  is  more  extensive  than  many 
French  Departements  or  small  German  Principalities.  When  the  Countess 
of  Sutherland  inherited  these  estates,  which  she  afterward  brought  to  her 
30  husband, the Marquis of Stafford, afterward Duke of Sutherland, the popula 
tion of them was  already reduced to  15,000.  My lady Countess resolved upon 
a  radical  economical  reform,  and  determined  upon transforming the  whole 
tract  of  country  into  sheep-walks.  From  1811  to  1820,  these  15,000  in 
habitants,  about  3,000  families,  were  systematically  expelled  and  ex-
terminated. All their villages were demolished and burned down, and all their 
fields  converted  into  pasturage.  British  soldiers  were  commanded  for  this 
execution,  and  came  to  blows  with  the  natives.  An  old  woman  refusing  to 
quit  her  hut,  was  burned  in  the  flames  of  it.  Thus  my  lady  Countess  ap 
propriated  to  herself  seven  hundred  and  ninety-four  thousand  acres  of  land, 

35 

40  which  from  time  immemorial  had belonged to  the  clan.  In  the  exuberance 
of  her  generosity  she  allotted  to  the  expelled  natives  about  6,000  acres— 

21 

Karl  Marx 

2  acres  per  family.  These  6,000  acres  had been laying  waste  until then,  and 
brought  no  revenue  to  the proprietors.  The  Countess was  generous  enough 
to  sell  the  acre  at  2s. 6d.  on  an  average,  to  the  clan-men  who  for centuries 
past  had  shed  their  blood  for  her  family.  The  whole  of  the  unrightfully 
appropriated  clan-land  she  divided into  29 large  sheep farms, each of them 
inhabited  by  one  single  family,  mostly  English  farm-laborers;  and  in  1820 
the  15,000  Gaels  had  already  been  superseded  by  131,000  sheep. 

5 

A  portion  of  the  aborigines  had  been  thrown  upon  the  sea-shore,  and 
attempted  to  live  by  fishing.  They  became  amphibious,  and,  as  an  English 
author  says,  lived  half  on land  and  half  on  water,  and  after  all did not half 
Uve  upon  both. 

10 

Sismondi,  in  his  "Études  Sociales, "  observes  with  regard  to  this  ex 
propriation  of  the  Gaels  from  Sutherlandshire—an  example,  which,  by-the-
bye,  was  imitated  by  the  other  "great  men"  of  Scotland: 

"The  large  extent of  seignorial domains is  not a circumstance peculiar to  15 

Britain.  In the  whole  Empire  of  Charlemagne,  in the  whole Occident, entire 
provinces  were  usurped by the  warlike  chiefs,  who  had  them  cultivated for 
their  own  account  by  the  vanquished,  and  sometimes  by  their  own  com 
panions  in  arms.  During  the  9th  and  10th  centuries  the  Counties of Maine, 
Anjou,  Poitou  were  for  the  Counts  of  these  provinces  rather  three  large  20 
estates than principalities.  Switzerland, which in so many respects resembles 
Scotland,  was  at  that  time  divided  among  a  small  number  of  Seigneurs.  If 
the  Counts  of  Kyburg,  of  Lentzburg,  of  Habsburg,  of  Gruyères  had  been 
protected by British laws,  they would have been  in the  same position as the 
Earls  of  Sutherland;  some  of  them  would perhaps  have  had the  same taste  25 
for improvement as the  Marchioness  of Stafford, and more than one republic 
might  have  disappeared  from  the  Alps  in order  to  make  room  for flocks  of 
sheep.  Not  the  most  despotic  monarch  in  Germany  would  be  allowed  to 
attempt  anything  of  the  sort." 

Mr. Loch,  in his  defense  of the  Countess  of Sutherland,  (1820,) replies to  30 

the  above  as  follows: 

"Why should there be made an exception to the rule adopted in every other 
case,  just for this  particular case?  Why  should  the  absolute  authority of the 
landlord  over  his  land  be  sacrificed  to  the  public  interest  and  to  motives 
which concern the  public  only?" 

35 

And  why,  then,  should  the  slaveholders  in  the  Southern  States  of North 
America  sacrifice  their  private  interest to  the  philanthropic  grimaces  of  her 
Grace,  the  Duchess  of  Sutherland? 

The  British  aristocracy,  who  have  everywhere  superseded  man  by  bul 
locks and sheep, will, in a future not very distant, be superseded, in turn, by  40 
these  useful  animals. 

22 

Elections—Financial  Clouds—The  Duchess  of  Sutherland  and  Slavery 

The  process  of  clearing  estates  which,  in  Scotland,  we  have  just  now 
described,  was  carried  out  in  England  in  the  16th,  17th und  18th centuries. 
Thomas  Morus  already  complains  of  it  in  the  begmning  of  the  16th century. 
It  was  performed  in  Scotland  in  the  beginning of the  19th,  and  in  Ireland  it 
is  now  in full  progress. The  noble Viscount Palmerston,  too,  some years  ago 
cleared  of  men  his  property  in  Ireland,  exactly  in  the.  manner  described 
above. 

5 

10 

If  of  any  property  it  ever  was  true  that  it  was  robbery,  it  is  literally  true 
of  the  property  of  the  British  aristocracy.  Robbery  of  Church-property, 
robbery  of  commons,  fraudulent  transformation,  accompanied  by  murder, 
of  feudal  and  patriarchal  property  into  private  property—these  are  the  titles 
of  British  aristocrats  to  their  possessions.  And  what  services  in  this  latter 
process  were  performed  by  a  servile  class  of  lawyers,  you  may  see  from  an 
English lawyer  of the  last  century.  Dalrymple, who, in his "History of Feudal 
15  Property,"  very  naively  proves  that  every  law  or  deed  concerning  property 
was  interpreted  by  the  lawyers,  in  England,  when  the  middle  class  rose  in 
wealth,  in  favor  of  the  middle  class-in  Scotland,  where the  nobility enriched 
themselves,  in  favor  of  the  nobility—ία  either  case  it  was  interpreted  in  a 
sense  hostile  to  the  people. 

20 

The  above  Turkish  reform  by  the  Countess  of  Sutherland was justifiable, 
at  least,  from  a  Malthusian  point  of  view.  Other  Scottish  noblemen  went 
further.  Having  superseded  human  beings  by  sheep,  they  superseded  sheep 
by  game,  and  the  pasture  grounds  by  forests.  At the  head  of  these  was  the 
Duke  of  Atholl.  "After  the  conquest,  the  Norman  Kings  afforested  large 
25  portions  of  the  soil  of  England,  in  much the  same  way  as the landlords here 
are  now  doing  with  the  Highlands."  (R. Somer's  Letters  on  the  Highlands, 
1848.) 

As  for  a  large  number  of  the  human beings  expelled  to make room  for  the 
game  of  the  Duke  of  Atholl,  and  the  sheep  of  the  Countess  of  Sutherland, 

30  where  did  they  fly  to,  where  did  they  find  a  home? 

In  the  United  States  of  North  America. 
The  enemy  of  British  Wages-Slavery  has  a  right  to  condemn Negro-Slav­
ery ;  a Duchess  of  Sutherland,  a Duke  of Atholl,  a Manchester Cotton-lord— 
never!

Capital Punishment—Mr. Cobden's Pamphlet-
Regulations  of  the  Bank of  England. 

Correspondence  of  The  N.Y.Tribune. 

London,  Friday, Jan. 28,  1853. 

The  Times of  Jan. 25  contains  the  following  observations  under  the  head  of 
"Amateur  Hanging:" 

"It  has  often  been  remarked  that  in  this  country  a  public  execution  is 
generally  followed  closely by instances  of  death  by  hanging,  either  suicidal 
or  accidental,  in  consequence  of  the  powerful effect which the execution of 
a  noted  criminal  produces  upon  a  morbid  and  unmatured  mind." 

Of  the  several  cases  which  are  alleged  by  The  Times in illustration of this 
remark,  one  is  that  of  a  lunatic  at  Sheffield,  who,  after  talking  with  other 
lunatics  respecting  the  execution of  Barbour, put  an end  to his existence by 
hanging  himself.  Another  case  is  that  of  a boy  of  14  years,  who  also  hung 
himself. 

The  doctrine to which the enumeration of these facts was intended to give 
its support, is one which no reasonable man would be likely to guess, it being 
no  less  than  a  direct  apotheosis  of  the  hangman,  while  capital  punishment 
is  extolled  as  the  ultima ratio of  society.  This  is  done  in a leading  article  of 
the  "leading  journal." 

The  Morning  Advertiser,  in  some  very  bitter  but  just  strictures  on  the 
hanging  predilections  and  bloody  logic  of  The  Times,  has  the  following 
interesting  data  on  43  days  of  the  year  1849:

This  table,  as  The  Times  concedes,  shows  not  only  suicides,  but  also 
murders  of  the  most  atrocious  kind,  following  closely  upon  the  execution 
of  criminals.  It  is  astonishing,  that  the  article  in  question  does  not  even 
20  produce  a  single  argument  or  pretext  for  indulging  in  the  savage  theory 
therein  propounded;  and  it  would  be  very  difficult,  if  not  altogether  im 
possible,  to  establish any principle upon which the justice or expediency of 
capital punishment  could  be founded, in a society glorying in its civilization. 
Punishment in general  has  been  defended  as  a  means  either  of  ameliorating 
25 or of intimidating. Now what right have you to punish me for the amelioration 
or intimidation of  others? And besides, there is history—there is such a thing 
as  statistics—which  prove  with  the  most complete  evidence  that  since  Cain 
the world has neither been intimidated nor ameliorated by punishment. Quite 
the contrary.  From the point of view of abstract right, there is only one theory 
30  of  punishment which  recognizes  human  dignity  in  the  abstract,  and that is 
the  theory  of  Kant,  especially in the more rigid formula given to it by Hegel. 
Hegel  says: 

"Punishment  is  the  right of  the  criminal.  It  is  an act of  his  own will.  The 
violation  of  right  has been proclaimed by the criminal  as his  own right.  His 
35  crime  is  the  negation  of  right.  Punishment  is  the  negation of  this negation, 
and  consequently  an  affirmation  of  right,  solicited  and  forced  upon  the 
criminal  by  himself." 

There  is  no  doubt  something specious in this formula, inasmuch as Hegel, 
instead of looking upon the criminal  as the mere object, the slave of justice, 
40  elevates  him  to  the  position  of  a free  and  self-determined  being.  Looking, 
however,  more  closely  into  the  matter,  we  discover  that  German  idealism 
here,  as  in  most  other  instances  has  but  given a transcendental  sanction to 

25 

Karl  Marx 

the rules of existing society. Is it not a delusion to substitute for the individual 
with  his  real motives,  with multifarious  social  circumstances  pressing upon 
him,  the  abstraction  of  "free-will"—one  among  the  many  qualities  of  man 
for  man  himself?  This  theory,  considering  punishment  as  the  result  of  the 
criminal's  own will,  is  only  a metaphysical expression for the old "jus talio- 
ids": eye against eye, tooth against tooth, blood against blood. Plainly speak 
ing,  and dispensing  with all paraphrases,  punishment is nothing but a means 
of  society  to  defend  itself  against  the  infraction  of  its  vital  conditions, 
whatever  may be  their character.  Now, what a state of  society is that, which 
knows  of  no  better  instrument  for  its  own  defense  than  the  hangman,  and  10 
which proclaims, through the "leading journal of the world" its own brutality 
as  eternal  law?

Mr. A. Quételet,  in  his  excellent  and  learned  work,  "l'Homme  et  ses 

Facultés,  "  says: 

"There  is  a  budget which  we  pay  with  frightful  regularity—it  is  that  of  15 

prisons,  dungeons  and  scaffolds  . ..  We  might  even  predict how  many  in 
dividuals will stain their hands with the blood of their fellow men, how many 
will  be  forgers,  how  many  will  deal  in  poison,  pretty  nearly  the  same  way 
as  we  may  foretell  the  annual  births  and  deaths." 

And  Mr. Quételet,  in a calculation of the probabilities  of  crime published  20 

in  1829,  actually  predicted  with  astonishing  certainty,  not  only  the  amount 
but  all  the  different  kinds  of  crimes  committed in France  in  1830.  That it is 
not  so  much the particular political institutions of a country as the fundamen 
tal  conditions  of  modern  bourgeois  society  in  general,  which  produce  an 
average  amount of crime in a given national fraction of society, may be seen  25 
from the following tables, communicated by Quételet, for the years  1822—24. 
We  find  in  a  number  of  one  hundred  condemned criminals  in  America  and 
France:

Now,  if  crimes  observed  on  a great  scale  thus  show,  in their  amount and  35 

their classification,  the regularity of physical phenomena—if, as Mr. Quételet 
remarks,  "it would  be  difficult  to  decide  in respect to  which of  the  two  (the 
physical  world  and  the  social  system)  the  acting causes produce their effect 
with  the  utmost  regularity"—is  there  not  a  necessity  for  deeply  reflecting 
upon an alteration of the  system that breeds these crimes, instead of glorify-  40

Capital  Punishment—Mr. Cobden's  Pamphlet—Regulations  of  the  Bank  of  England 

ing the  hangman who  executes  a lot of  criminals  to  make room only for the 
supply  of  new  ones? 

One of the topics of the day is the publication of a pamphlet by Mr. Richard 
Cobden-"1793  and  1853, in three Letters," (140 pages.) The first part of this 
5  pamphlet, treating of the time of and previous to, the revolution of  1793, has 
the  merit  of  attacking  openly  and  vigorously  the  old  English  prejudices 
respecting  that  epoch.  Mr. Cobden  shows  that  England  was  the  aggressive 
party  in  the  revolutionary  war.  But  here  he  has  no  claim  to  originality,  as 
he  does but repeat,  and  in a much less brilliant manner, the statements once 
10  given by the greatest pamphleteer England has ever possessed, viz: the late 
William  Cobbett.  The  other  part of  the  pamphlet,  although written from  an 
economical  point  of  view,  is  of  a  rather  romantic  character.  Mr. Cobden 
labors  to  prove  that  the  idea  of  Louis  Napoleon's  having  any  intention  of 
invading  England  is  a  mere  absurdity;  that  the  noise  about the  defenseless 
state  of  the  country  has  no  material  foundation,  and is propagated only by 
persons interested in augmenting the public expenditure. By what arguments 
does he prove that Louis Napoleon has no hostile intentions toward England? 
Louis  Napoleon,  he  contends,  has  no  rational ground  for  quarreling  with 
England.  And  how  does  he  prove  that  a  foreign  invasion of this  country is 
impossible?  For 800 years, says Mr. Cobden, England has not been invaded. 
And  what  are  his  arguments to  show that the  cry about the  defenseless  state 
is  a mere  interested humbug?  The highest military authorities have declared 
that  they  feel  quite  safe! 

20 

15 

25 

Louis  Napoleon  has  never  met,  even  in  the  Legislative  Assembly,  with 
a more credulous believer in his faith and peaceable intentions, than he finds 
now,  rather  unexpectedly,  in  Mr. Richard  Cobden.  The Morning Herald (in 
yesterday's  number),  the habitual defender  of  Louis  Napoleon, publishes  a 
letter  addressed  to  Mr. Cobden,  and  alleged to  have been written under  the 
immediate  inspiration  of  Bonaparte  himself,  in  which  the  prince-hero  of 
30  Satory  assures  us  that  he  will  only  come  over  to  England,  if  the  Queen, 
threatened  by  rising  Democracy,  should  want  some  200,000  of  his  de-
cembraillards  or  bullies.  But  this  Democracy,  according  to  The  Herald,  is 
nobody  else  than  Messrs.  Cobden  &  Co. 

35 

We  must confess  that,  having perused  the pamphlet in question, we  begin 
to  feel  an  apprehension  of  something  like  an  invasion  of  Great-Britain. 
Mr. Cobden  is  no  very  happy  prophet.  After  the  repeal of the  corn-laws  he 
made  a trip to the Continent, visiting even Russia,  and after his return stated 
that  all  things  were  right,  that  the  times  of  violence  had  passed,  that  the 
nations  deeply  and  eagerly  involved  in  commercial  and industrial pursuits, 
40  would  now  develope  themselves  in  a  quiet  business-like  manner,  without 
political  storms,  without  outbreaks  and  disturbances.  His  prophecy  had 

27 

Karl  Marx 

scarcely reached the  Continent, when the Revolution of  1848 burst forth over 
all  Europe,  and  gave  a  somewhat  ironical  echo  to  Mr. Cobden's  meek pre 
dictions.  He  talked  peace,  where  there  was  no  peace. 

It  would  be  a  great  mistake  to  suppose  that  the  peace  doctrine  of  the 
Manchester  School has  a deep philosophical bearing. It only means, that the 
feudal  method  of  warfare  shall  be  supplanted  by  the  commercial  o n e-
cannons  by  capital.  The  Peace-Society  yesterday  held  a  meeting  at  Man 
chester,  where  it  was  almost  unanimously  declared,  that  Louis  Napoleon 
could  not  be  supposed  as  intending  anything  against the  safety  of  England, 
if  the  press  would  but  discontinue  its  odious  censures  on  his  Government, 
and  become  mute! Now,  with  this  statement,  it  appears  very  singular,  that 
the  increased  army  and  navy  estimates  have  been  voted  in  the  House  of 
Commons  without  opposition,  none  of  the  M.P.'s  present  at  the  Peace-
Conference  having  had  anything  to  say  against the  proposed addition to the 
mihtary force. 

During  the  political  calm,  produced  by  the  adjournment  of  Parliament, 
there  are  two  principal  topics  which  occupy  the  press,  viz.:  The  coming 
Reform  bill,  and  the  last  Discount  Regulations  of  the  Bank  of  England. 

5 

10 

15 

The  Times  of  the  24th  inst,  informs  the  public  that  a new  Reform  bill  is 
on  the  stocks.  What kind of a Reform bill it will be,  you may infer from  Sir  20 
Charles  Wood's  election-speech  at Halifax, in which he declared against the 
principle  of  equal  electoral  districts;  from  Sir  James  Graham's  at  Carlisle, 
where  he  rejected  the  ballot;  and  from  the  confidentially  circulated  state 
ment,  that  even  the  small  Reform  pills  prescribed  in  Feb.  1852  by  Johnny 
Russell,  are  considered  as far too  strong and dangerous.  But there is  some-  25 
thing  which  looks  yet  more  suspicious.  The  mouth-piece  of  the  Coalition 
Ministry,  Tfie  Economist,  in  the  number  of  Jan. 22,  states,  not  only: 

"That  the  reform  of  our  representative  system  stands  not  very  early  on 
the  list  of  topics  of  pressing  or  immediate  importance,"  but  also,  that "we 
want  the  raw  materials  for  legislative  action.  The  extension,  adjustment, 
purification, protection and re-distribution of the Franchise,  are branches of 
the  question,  each  of  which  demands  profound  reflection,  and  much  in 
quiry  . ..  It  is  not  that  several  of  our  statesmen  may  not  have  a  good  deal 
of  useful  information  on  all  or  some  of  these  points,  but  it  is  picked  up,  not 
worked out; it is miscellaneous, partial, and incomplete... The obvious mode  35 
of  remedying  this,  is  by  issuing  a  Commission  of Inquiry,  charged,  to  in 
vestigate  all  points  of  fact  directly  or  remotely  connected  with  the  sub

neophytes  of  half-a-century  back,  are  unable,  from  want  of  experience,  to 
propose  to  Parliament  any  decisive measure on Electoral Reform. Thus, the 
old  proverb,  that  experience  comes  with  age,  appears  to  be  refuted.  "This 
coyness  in  a  coalition  of  veteran  partisans  is  something  too  comical  to  be 
easily  described,"  exclaims  The Daily News,  asking:  "Where is your Reform 
Bill?"  The  Morning  Advertiser  replies: 

"We  should  be  mclined  to  the  opinion  that  there  will  be  no  Reform  Bill 
at  all  during  the  present  session.  There  may  be  some  attempt  at legislating 
for  the  prevention  and  punishment  of  bribery  at elections,  and with regard 
to  some other matters of minor importance, an effort maybe made to remedy 
evils  connected  with  the  parliamentary  representations  of  the  country,  but 
such  legislation  will  not  be  deserving  the  name  of  a  new  Reform  Bill."

With  regard  to  the  late  discount  regulations  of  the  Bank of  England,  the 
15  panic at first called forth by them, has now subsided, and business men alike 
with  theorists,  have  assured  themselves  that the  present prosperity will  not 
be  seriously interrupted or checked.  But read the  following extract from  The 
Economist: 

20 

"This  year,  upon an immense  extent of  our wheat lands, there  is  no plant 
at all.  On a very large  proportion of our heavy soils, much of the land which 
should have been in wheat, remains unsown, and some of that which has been 
sown,  is  in no  better plight, for the  seed has either perished, or the plant has 
come  up  so  thinly,  or has been so  destroyed by  slugs, that the prospects of 
the  occupiers  are  not  better  than  those  of  the  unsown  lands.  It  has  now 

25  become  nearly  impossible  to  plant  all  the  wheat land." 

Now  the  crisis,  temporarily  protracted  by the  opening of  the  Californian 
and  Australian  markets  and  mines,  will  unquestionably become  due, in the 
event  of  a  bad  harvest.  The  discount  regulations  of  the  Bank  are  only  the 
first  forebodings.  In  1847  the  Bank  of  England  altered  its  rate  of  discount 
30  13  times. In  1853 there will be a full score of such measures. In conclusion, 
I  wish to  ask the  English  Economists,  how it happens  that  modern Political 
Economy  commenced  its  warfare  against  the  mercantile  system  by  demon 
strating  that  the  influx  and  efflux  of  gold  in  a  country  are  indifferent,  that 
products  are only exchanged against products,  and that gold is a product like 
35  all others. While the very same Economy, now at the end of its career, is most 
anxiously  watching  the  efflux  and  influx  of  gold?  "The  real  object  to  be 
accomplished  by  the  operations  of  the  Bank,"  says  The  Economist,  "is  to 
prevent  an  exportation  of  capital."  Now,  would  The  Economist prevent  an 
exportation  of  capital  in the  shape  of  cotton,  iron, woolen yarns  and stuffs? 
40  And  is  gold  not  a  product  like  all  other products?  Or  has  The  Economist 

turned,  in  his  old  days,  a  Mercantilist?  And  after  having  set  free  the  im-

29 

Karl  Marx 

portation of foreign capital, does he aim at checking the exportation of British 
capital?  After  having  freed  himself  from  the  civilized  system  of  protection, 
w in  he  recur  to  the  Turkish  one? 

I  am  just  concluding my letter, as  I am informed, that a report is prevalent 
in  political  circles,  that  Mr. Gladstone  is  at  variance  with  several  of  the 
leading  members  of  the  Aberdeen  Ministry,  on  the  subject  of  the  Income 
Tax, and that the result of the misunderstanding will probably be the resigna 
tion of the Right Hon.  gentleman.  In that case,  Sir Francis Baring, formerly 
Chancellor  of the  Exchequer under  Lord  Melbourne,  will  probably become 
his  successor.

Defense—Finances-
Decrease  of  the  Aristocracy—Politics. 

Correspondence  of  the  N.Y.Tribune. 

London,  Tuesday,  Feb. 8,  1853. 

5 

The  Daily  News  states  that  the  establishment  of  a  defensive  coast-militia 

is  under  the  serious  consideration  of  the  Government. 

The  Bank  accounts  shew  a  further  decrease  of  bullion  to  the  amount 
of  £362,084.  There  have  been  shipped,  during  the  last  fortnight,  about 
£1,000,000  partly for  the  continent  and  partly  in  coin, for Australia.  As  the 
10  bullion in the Bank of France continues to also decrease, in spite of the large 
importation of  gold from  England,  there  has  apparently  sprung up  a system 
of  private  hoarding,  which  strongly  indicates  the  general  distrust  in  the 
stability  of  Napoleonic  government. 

At present there  is  manifested  a  general  demand  for  higher  wages, on the 
15  part of workingmen,  especially  shipwrights, colliers, factory-operatives and 
mechanics.  This  demand is  owing to the prevailing prosperity and cannot be 
considered  as  a  very  particular  event.  A  fact  which  deserves  more  notice, 
is a regular strike amongst agricultural laborers, a thing which has never taken 
place  before.  The  laborers  of  South  Wilts  have  struck  for  a  advance  of 

20  2  shillings,  their  weekly wages  amounting now  only to 7s. 

According  to  the  quarterly  returns  of  the  registrar-general,  emigration 
from  Great  Britain  was  going  on  through  the  past year,  at the  rate  of  1,000 
a-day,  the  increase  of  population  being  somewhat  slower.  Simultaneously 
there  was  a  large  increase  of  marriages. 

25 

The  deaths  of  Viscount  Melbourne  and  the  Earl  of  Tyrconnel,  with that 
of  the  Earl  of  Oxford,  make  no less  than three  peerages, that have become 
extinct  within  the  last  fortnight.  If  there  be  any  class  exempt  from  the 
Malthusian  law  of  procreation in  a geometrical progression,  it is  that of the 
hereditary  aristocracy.  Take  for  instance,  the  peers  and  baronets  of  Great 

31 

Karl  Marx

Britain.  Few,  if any,  of the Norman nobility exist at this time  and not much 
more  of  the  original  baronet  families  of  King  James  I.  The  great  majority 
of  the  House  of  Lords  were  created  in  1760.  The  order  of  baronets  com 
menced  in  1611,  under James  I.  There  are  at present only thirteen surviving 
out  of  the number  of baronet-families then created,  and of those  created in 
1625 there remain but 39. The extraordinary decrease of the Venitian nobility 
affords  another  instance of the prevalence of the  same law, notwithstanding 
that  all the  sons  were  ennobled  by  birth.  Amelot counted  in  bis  time  2,500 
nobles  at  Venice,  possessing  the  right of voting in the council.  At the com 
mencement of  the  18th century there remained  only  1,500, in spite of a later  10 
addition of  several families.  From  1583—1654, the sovereign council of Berne 
admitted  into  the  hereditary  patricia  487  families,  of  which  379  became 
extinct  within  the  space  of  two  centuries  while  in  1783  there  survived only 
108.  To  recur  to  remoter  periods  of  history,  Tacitus  informs  us  that  the 
Emperor  Claudius  created  a new stock of patricians,  "exhaustis etiam,  quas 
dictator  Caesar  lege  Cassia,  et  princeps  Augustus,  lege  Saenia,  sublegere.  " 
It is  evident from these facts, that nature does not like hereditary aristocracy, 
and  it may  safely be  asserted  that  but for a continual infusion of new blood, 
and  an  artificial  system  of  propping up,  the  English House  of  Lords  would 
ere  this  have died its  natural death.  Modern physiology has  ascertained the  20 
fact,  that  fertility  decreases  among  the  higher  animals,  inversely  with  the 
development of  the  nervous  system,  especially with the growing bulk of the 
brain.  But  no  one  will  venture  to  affirm  that  the  extinction  of  the  English 
aristocracy  has  anything  to  do  with  an  exuberance  of  brain. 

15 

It  appears  that  the  "millennium"  is  already  considered  as  broken  down  25 

by the  same  parties  who  predicted  and  originated it,  even before  the House 
of  Commons  has  taken  place.  The  Times,  in  its  number  of  Feb. 4,  says: 

"While  Manchester  has  been  fulminating  her  indignation  against  the 
Government  of  Lord  Aberdeen,  . ..  Irish  Popery  and  S o c i a l i sm  (?)  are 
bestowing  their  questionable  praises  on  Lord  Derby  and  Mr. D'Israeli." 

30 

As  to  the  Msh  Socialism  alluded  to  in  The  Times,  this  term  applies,  of 
course,  to  the  Tenant Right  agitation.  On  a future  occasion I intend to  show 
that  the  theories  of  all modern English bourgeois-economists  are  in perfect 
accordance  with  the  principle  of  Tenant-Right.  How  little  the  tenor  of  The 
Times article just quoted is  shared in by other newspapers, may be seen from 
the  following  contained  in  The  Morning  Advertiser: 

35 

"We  should  despise  the  Irishmen,  could  we  believe  them  capable  of 

deserting  the  principle  of  Tenant-Right." 

The wrath of the  Aberdeen organ is  explained by the fact of the Millennar-

ian Ministry being completely disappointed. Messrs. Sadleir and Keogh were 40 
the  acknowledged  leaders  of  the  Brigade—the  one  in the  Cabinet,  the  other 

32 

Defense—Finances—Decrease  of  the  Aristocracy—Politics 

in  the  field.  Mr. Sadleir  directed  and  managed,  while  Mr. Keogh  made  the 
speeches.  It was  supposed  that the purchase  of  these  two would bring over 
the  whole  lot.  But  the  members  of  the  Brigade  were  sent  to  Parliament 
pledged  to  stand  in  opposition  to,  and  to  remain  independent  of  every 
5  Government  that  would not establish perfect religious  equality,  and realize 
the  principle  of  Sharman  Crawford's  bill  on  the  rights  of  the  Irish tenants. 
The  Times,  therefore,  is  indignated  at  these  men  being  unwilling  to  break 
their  faith.  The  immediate  cause  of  the  outbreak  of  this  angry feeling was 
given  by  a  meeting  and  banquet  at  Kells,  County  of  Meath.  The  circular 
invited those to whom it was  addressed, to  express their indignation at "the 
recent  desertion  from  the  Irish  Parliamentary  party,"  and a resolution was 
passed  in  that  sense. 

10 

15 

This  failure  in the  calculations  of  the  Ministry with regard to  the  Brigade 
could  have  been  anticipated;  but  a  transformation  is  now  going  on  in  the 
character and position of Irish parties, of the  deep bearing of which neither 
they nor the English press appear yet to be aware. The bishops and the mass 
of the clergy approve of the course taken by the Catholic members, who have 
joined the Administration. At Carlow, the clergy afforded their entire support 
to  Mr. Sadleir, who  would  not have  been defeated but for  the  efforts  of  the 
20  Tenant-Leaguers.  In  what  light  this  schism is  viewed by the  true  Catholic 
party,  may be  seen from an article in the French  Umvers, the European organ 
of  Jesuitism.  It  says: 

25 

"The  only  reproach  which  can,  with  good  foundation,  be  objected  to 
Messrs.  Keogh  and  Sadleir,  is,  that they  suffered  themselves to be thrown 
into connection with two Associations (the Tenant-League and the Religious 
Equality  Association)  which  have  no  other  object  than  to  make  patent the 
anarchy  which  consumes  Ireland." 

In  its  indignation,  the  Umvers betrays  its  secret: 
"We  deeply  regret  to  see  the  two  Associations  put  themselves  in  open 
30  opposition  to  the  bishops  and  clergy,  in  a country  where  the  prelates  and 
dignitaries of the Church have hitherto been the  safest guides of popular and 
national  organization." 

35 

40 

We  may  infer  that,  should  thé  Tenant-Leaguers  happen  to  be  in France, 
the  Umvers  would  cause  them  to  be  transported  to  Cayenne.  The  Repeal 
agitation was  a mere  political movement,  and therefore, it was possible for 
the  Catholic  clergy  to  make  use  of  it,  for  extorting  concessions  from  the 
English  Government  while  the  people  were  nothing  but  the  tools  of  the 
priests. The Tenant-Right agitation is a deep-rooted social movement which, 
in its  course, will produce  a downright  scission between the Church and the 
Irish Revolutionary party,  and thus  emancipate the people from that mental 
thraldom  which  has  frustrated  all  their  exertions,  sacrifices,  and  struggles 
for  centuries  past. 

33 

Karl  Marx 

I  pass  now  to  the  "Reunion"  of  the  leading  reformers  of  the  County  of 
Lancaster  and  its  representatives,  which was  held  at Manchester on the  3d 
inst.  Mr. G e o r ge  W i l s on  was  in the chair. He spoke only of the iniquitous 
representation  of  the  commercial  and industrial compared with the  agricul 
tural  districts,  upon  which  he  expressed  himself  in  the  following  terms: 

"In  the  five  Counties  of  Buckingham,  Dorset,  Wilts,  Northampton,  and 
Salop,  63  members  were  returned  by  52,921  voters,  while  only  the  same 
number were returned by Lancashire  and Yorkshire, with 89,669 county and 
84,612  borough voters,  making  a total  of  174,281.  So  that,  if  they  returned 
members  in proportion to  voters  alone, those five counties could only claim 
19;  while,  if  Lancashire  took  their  proportion,  it  would  be  entitled  to  207. 
There  were  twelve  large  cities  or  boroughs  (taking  London  as  a  double 
borough)  returning  24  members,  with  192,000  voters,  and  a  population  of 
3,268,218, and 383,000 inhabited houses. On the other side, 24 members were 
returned  by  Andover,  Buckingham,  Chippenham,  Cockermouth,  Totnes, 
Harwich,  Bedford,  Lymington,  Marlborough,  Great  Marlow  and  Rich 
mond; but they had only 3,569 voters, 67,434 inhabitants, and 1,373 inhabited 
houses  . ..  The  most  timid  reformer  and  most  moderate  man  would  hardly 
object to the  disfranchisement of those boroughs which had a population less 
than  5,000,  and  to  handing  over  the  20  members  to  those  large  con 
stituencies." 

Mr. Milner  Gibson,  M.P.,  took up  the  subject of  National Education,  and 
the  Taxes  on  Knowledge.  With  regard  to  the  Reform bill, the  only passage 
in  his  speech deserving notice, is  his  declaration on the point of  equal elec 
toral  districts: 

"It  may  be,  if  you  please,  a  great  class-question." 
Mr. Brotherton,  another  M.P.,  said: 
"No Reform bill would be  satisfactory, at this  time, which did not propose 

to  equalize  the  distribution  of  the  representation." 

But by  far  the  most  memorable  speech  was  that of Mr. Bright,  M.P.,  the 

real  man  among  the  "Manchester  men."  He  said: 

"The  Government  is  a  coalition  Government,  composed  of  Whigs  and 
Peelites  . ..  There  is no great cause for throwing up  of caps,  as  if we had in 
the  Government men of  new  principles,  and of  a new policy, who are about 
to  take  a  great  start,  and who would not require  to be urged  on by  all those 
who  are  favorable  to  Reform,  in  every  part  of  the  country."  (Hear.) 

In  reference  to  Parliamentary  Reform  he  said: 
"If Louis Napoleon had started with a Representation like ours, in France, 
if  he  had  given  all  the  Members  to  the  rural  districts, where the  Bonaparte 
family  are  so  popular,  and  had  not  allowed  Members  to  be  returned  from 
Paris,  and  Lyons,  and  Marseilles,  all  the  Press  of  England  would  have 

34 

Defense—Finances—Decrease  of  the  Aristocracy—Politics 

5 

denounced  the  sham  Representation  which  he  was  establishing  in  that 
country.  (Hear!  h e a r ! ) . ..  We have  one-eighth of the population of England 
here in Lancashire; we have  one-tenth of its rateable property, and we have 
one-tenth  of  the  whole  number  of  houses  . ..  We  begin  to  know  where  we 
are  now.  (Loud  cheers.)  . ..  There  is  another  little  difficulty,  which is  the 
difficulty  of  the  ballot.  (Hear!  hear!)  I  read  Lord John  Russell's  speech  at 
his  election,  and really these London electors were in capital humor, or they 
could  not have  allowed  such  an  argument to  pass  without  saying  something 
against  it.  'He  was  against  secrecy  everywhere;'  and when I read the para-
io  graph,  I  said  to  myself  'Very  well;  if  I  had  been  one  of  your  supporters,  I 
should  have  recommended  you  to  take  a  reporter  from  The  Times  Office 
to  the  next  Cabinet-meeting  with  you.'"  (Hear!  laughter.) 

15 

20 

25 

Now  we  come  to  Sir  James  Graham's  argument: 
"He  did  not  think  secret  voting  could  be  made  compulsory." 
Why  can it not be  made  compulsory?  Open voting  is  made  compulsory, 
and  secret  voting  could be  made compulsory.  It is  compulsory,  at any rate, 
in  the  State  of  Massachusetts,  if  not  in the-other  States of North America; 
and  Sir James  Graham  knows  perfectly well that there was no force in what 
he was  saying to 2,000 or 3,000 of the people of Carlisle, on a rainy day, when, 
I  suppose,  people  did  not  weigh  matters  under  their  umbrellas  very  care 
fully. 

"We must not forget," concluded Mr. Bright,  "that everything the country 
has  gained  since  the  Revolution  of  1688—and  especially  everything  of  late 
years—has  been  gained  in  a  manly  contest  of  the  industrial  and  commercial 
classes  against  the  Aristocracy and  the privileged classes  of this country.  We 

must carry on the  same conflict; there are great things yet to be done." (Hear! 
hear!  and  cheers.) 

The  resolution  unanimously  agreed  to  was: 
"That  this  meeting  requests  the  Liberal  Members  connected  with  the 
30  County  of  Lancaster  to  consider  themselves  a  committee  for  the  purpose 
of  aiding  in  any  proceedings  with  reference  to  Parliamentary  reform,  with 
a view to  secure  such additional representation for the County, as its popula 
tion,  industry,  wealth  and  intelligence  require." 

35 

The Manchester  school  have repeated  at this  meeting their battle cry: the 
industrial  Bourgeoisie  against the Aristocracy; but, on the  other hand, they 
have also betrayed the  secret of their policy, viz.:  the exclusion of the people 
from  the  representation  of  the  country,  and  the  strict  maintenance  of their 
particular  class-interest.  All that was  said with regard to  the ballot, national 
education,  taxes on knowledge,  etc., is nothing but rhetorical flourishes; the 
40  only  serious  object  being  the  equalization  of  Electoral  Districts—at  the  least 
the  only  one  upon  which  a resolution was  passed  and  a pledge  taken by  the 

35 

Karl  Marx 

members?  Why  this?  With equal  electoral  districts  the  town  interest would 
become  the  commander  of  the  country-interest—the  bourgeoisie would  be 
come  master  of the  House of  Commons.  If it were given to  the Manchester 
men to obtain equal electoral districts, without a necessity of making serious 
concessions  to  the  Chartists,  the  latter  would find  instead  of two enemies, 
mutually  trying  to  outbid  each  other  in  their appeals to them, one  compact 
army  of  foes,  who  would  concentrate  all  their  forces  to  resist the  people's 
demands.  There  would  be,  for  a  while,  the  unrestricted  rule  of capital,  not 
only  industrially  but  also  politically. 

5 

A  bad  omen  for  the  coalition  Ministry  may  be  found  in  the  eulogiums  10 

bestowed  at  Kells  and  at Manchester  on the  fallen  Administration.  Mr. L u 
c a s,  M.P.,  said  at  Kells; 

"There  were  no  greater  enemies  to  Tenant  Right  than  the  Marquis  of 
Had they not had the 

Lansdowne, Lord Palmerston, Sidney Herbert, etc 
Whig  Ministry  and  the  Grahamites  nibbling  at  the  Tenant  question?  They  15 
had  on  the  other  hand  the  Tory  officials;  and  he  would leave  it to  the  con 
science  of  any  man,  who  read  the  propositions  that  emanated  from  the 
various  parties,  to  say  whether  the  treatment  of  the  subject  on  the  side  of 
the  Derby  Government  was  not  a  thousand times  more  honest than that of 
the  Whigs." 

20 

At the  Manchester Reunion,  M i l n er  G i b s on  said: 
"Although the Budget of the late Ministry, as a whole, was bad, still there 
were  indications  of  future  policy  in that budget—(Hear!  hear!) At least the 
late  Chancellor  of the Exchequer has broken the ice.  I mean with regard to 
the  Tea Duties.  I  have  heard  from  good  authority  that it was  the  intention  25 
of  the  late  Government to  repeal  the  Advertisement Duty." 

Mr. B r i g ht  went  still further in his  eulogium: 
"The late Government did a bold thing with regard to the Income Tax. For 
the country gentlemen of England, themselves the  owners of a vast portion 
of  the  fixed  landed  property  of the  country, for them to  come forward and  30 
support a proposition which  made  a distinction in the rate  charged on fixed 
property,  and  that  on  income  derived  from  trade  and  other  precarious 
sources,  was  a  step  that we  ought not to  lose  sight  of,  and  that we,  in this 
district, are bound to applaud. But there was another point to which Mr. Dis- 
raeli referred,  and for which I must say I feel grateful to him.  In the speech  35 
introducing  his  budget,  and  in  the  speech  in  which  he  contended  for  three 
hours,  with  that  mass  of  power  opposed  to  him,  on  the  night  of  his  final 
defeat, he referred to the taxes on successions, which is what we understand 
by  the  legacy  and  probate  duties,  and  he  admitted  that  it  required  to  be 
adjusted."  (Loud  cheers.)

The Italian Insurrection—British Politics. 

Correspondence  of  The  N.Y.Tribune. 

London, Friday, Feb. 11,  1853.

The  political  torpor  which,  under  the  protection of  nature's  dullest fog,  has 
for so long a time prevailed here, has been suddenly interrupted by the arrival 
of revolutionary  news  from  Italy.  Intelligence  has  been received by electric 
telegraph,  that an insurrection took place at Milan on the 6th; that proclama 
tions  had  been  posted up, one  by Mazzini,  the  other  by Kossuth,  exhorting 
the  Hungarians  in  the  Austrian  army  to  join  the  revolutionists;  that  the 
insurrection had been at first suppressed, but had afterwards recommenced; 
that the  Austrians  stationed in the arsenal had been massacred, etc. ; that the 
gates  of  Milan  were  shut  up.  The  French  Government  papers,  it  is  true, 
communicate  two  further  dispatches,  dated  Berne  the  9th,  and  Turin  8th, 
which  report  the  definitive  suppression  of  the  outbreak  on the  7th.  But  the 
15  non-arrival  of  any  direct information  at  the  English  Foreign office for two 

10 

days,  is  regarded  as  a  favorable  symptom  by  the  friends  of  Italy. 

Rumors are current in Paris, that great excitement prevailed at Pisa, Lucca 

and  in  other  towns. 

20 

At  Turin  the  ministry  met  in  haste,  in  consequence  of  a  communication 
from  the  Austrian  Consul,  in  order  to  deliberate  on the  aspect of  affairs  in 
Lombardy.  The  day,  on  which  the  first  information  reached  London,  was 
the  9th  of  February,  which  day,  curiously  enough,  is  also  the  anniversary 
of  the  proclamation  of  the  Roman  Republic  in  1849,  of  the  decapitation of 
Charles  I.  in  1649,  and  of  the  deposition  of  James  II.  in  1689. 

25 

As  regards the chances of the present insurrection at Milan,  there can be 
little  hope  of  success,  unless  some  of  the  Austrian  regiments  pass  over  to 
the  revolutionary  camp.  Private  letters  from  Turin,  which  I  expect  will 

37 

Karl  Marx 

shortly reach  me,  will  probably enable  me  to  furnish  you a detailed account 
of  the  whole  affair. 

Several  statements  as  to  the  character  of  the  amnesty  lately  granted  by 
Louis  Napoleon,  have  been  published  on  behalf  of  the  French  refugees. 
Victor  Frondes  (a  former  officer)  declares  in the  Nation,  a Brussels paper, 
that he  was  surprised  to  see  his name in the list of the  amnestied, he having 
already  amnestied  himself,  five  months  ago,  by  making  his  escape  from 
Algiers. 

5 

The  Moniteur  announced  at  first,  that  3,000  exiles  were  to  be  amnestied, 
and  that  only  about  1,200  citizens  would  remain  under  the  ban  of  pro-  10 
scription.  A few days  later  the same authority stated, that 4,312 persons had 
been  pardoned,  so  that  Louis  Napoleon actually forgave  100 persons  more 
than  he  had  previously  condemned.  Paris  and the  Department of  the  Seine 
alone  numbered  about  4,000  exiles.  Of  these  only  226  are  included  in  the 
amnesty.  The  Department  of  the  Hérault  counted  2,111  exiles;  299  are  15 
amnestied.  The  Nièvre  furnished  1,478  victims  among  whom  there  were 
1,100  fathers  of  families  averaging  three  children  each;  180  have  been 
amnestied.  In the Department of the Var 687 out of 2,281 have been released. 
Among the  1,200 republicans  transported  to  Cayenne,  only a few have been 
pardoned, and precisely such as have escaped already from that penal settle-  20 
ment.  The  number  of  persons  transported  to  Algeria  and  now  released,  is 
large, but still in no proportion to the immense mass of people that have been 
carried over  to  Africa, which is  said  to  amount to  12,000.  The refugees now 
living in England, Belgium, Switzerland and Spain, with very rare exceptions, 
are  entirely excluded from the decree.  On the other hand, the  amnesty lists  25 
actually  contain  a large  number of  persons  who  have  never  quitted  France, 
or  who  have  long  since  been  permitted  to  reenter  it;  nay,  more,  there  are 
names  which  figure  in  the  list  several  times.  But  the  most  monstrous  fact 
is,  that  the  list  is  swelled  with  the  names  of a large  number of persons  well 
known  to  have  been  slaughtered  during  the  sanguinary  "battues" of  De-  30 
cember. 

The  new  Parliamentary  session  commenced  yesterday.  As  a  worthy  in 
troduction  to  the  future  performances  of  the  Millenarian  Ministry,  the fol 
lowing  scene  was produced in the House of Lords: The Earl of Derby asked 
the  Earl  of  Aberdeen  what  measures  the  Government  proposed  to  submit  35 
to  the  consideration  of  Parliament; upon which the latter replied that he had 
already, on a former occasion, explained his principles, a repetition of which 
would  be  inconvenient;  and  that  any  further  statement,  before  the  com 
munication to be made in the House of Commons, would be premature.  And 
now ensued a most curious dialogue, in which the Earl of Derby spoke, and  40 
the  Earl  of  Aberdeen,  only  bowed  significantly: 

38 

The  Italian  insurrection—British  Politics 

The  Earl  of  Derby—'He  would  ask  the  noble  Lord  what  measures  he 

intended to  submit to their Lordships  in the  course of the  Session?" 

After  a few  seconds'  pause,  no  noble  Lord  having risen— 
The  Earl  of Derby—"Does  silence  mean  no  measures?"  (A  laugh.) 

5 

The  Earl  of Aberdeen—(Muttering  some  inaudible  words.) 
The  Earl  of  Derby—'May  I  be  permitted  to  ask  what  measures  will  be 

introduced  in  this  House?" 

No  answer. 
The  question  of  adjournment  being  put  by  the  Lord  Chancellor,  their 

10  Lordships  adjourned. 

Passing from  the  House  of  Lords  to  "Her Majesty's liege  Commons," we 
shall  observe  that  the  Earl  of  Aberdeen  has  expounded  the  programme  of 
the  Ministry much more  strikingly by  his  silence  than Lord  John Russell by 
his long and grave speech last night. The short resumé of the latter was: "No 
15  Measures,  but  Men;"  adjournment  of  all  questions  of  Parliamentary  im 
portance  for  one  year;  and  strict  payment  of  the  salaries  of  her  Majesty's 
Ministers  during  that  time.  Lord  John  Russell  stated  the  intention  of  the 
Government  in  nearly  these  words: 

20 

"With  regard  to  the  number  of men to  be  voted for the  Army,  the  Navy, 
and  Ordnance,  there  will  be  no  increase  beyond  the  number voted before 
the Christmas holidays. With regard to the amounts in the various estimates, 
there  will be found a considerable increase upon the estimates of last y e a r . .. 
A  bill  will  be  brought  in  to  enable  the  Legislature  of  Canada  to  dispose  of 
the  Clergy Reserves  in  C a n a d a . ..  The  President  of the  Board of Trade will 
25  move  for  the  introduction  of  a Pilotage b i l l . ..  The  disabilities  of  her  Ma 
jesty's  Jewish  subjects  will be  removed  ...  Propositions will be made on the 
subject of  Education.  I  am  not prepared  to  say that I am about to introduce, 
on the  part of her  Majesty's  Government,  a very  large  plan  on that  subject. 
It will  include educational measures for the poorer classes, and propositions 
30  with respect to the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge... Transportation 
to  Australia will  cease  . ..  There  will be  made  a proposal with respect to the 
system  of  secondary  punishments  . ..  Immediately  after  the  Easter recess, 
or as  soon as possible after that period, the Chancellor of the Exchequer will 
propose  the  financial  statement  for  the  year  . ..  The  Lord  Chancellor  will 
state  in  a  few  days  what  are  the  measures  he  proposes  to  bring in for  the 
improvement  of  the  law  . ..  It  is  the  intention  of  the  Chief  Secretary  for 
Ireland, in a few  days,  to  move  the  appointment of  a select Committee with 
regard  to  the  law  of  Landlord  and  Tenant  in  Ireland  . ..  Ministers  would 
endeavor to  effect  a renewal  of the  Income-Tax for the present year, without 

35 

40  any  observation or  discussion whatever." 

In  reference  to  Parliamentary Reform,  Lord  John Russell  declares  that it 

39 

Karl  Marx 

may  perhaps  be  taken into  consideration in the  next  session.  Accordingly, 
no  Reform  bill at present.  Nay more, Johnny was  at great pains  to  disclaim 
the idea of ever having promised to give a more liberal measure of representa 
tive  reform  than  his  bill  of  last  session.  He  was  even  indignant that words 
to  that  effect  should  have  been  ascribed to  him.  He  never  said  nor  meant 
anything  of  the  kind.  Nor  does  he  promise  that  his  intended  bill  of  next 
session will be as comprehensive as that of  1852.  With respect to bribery and 
corruption,  he  said: 

5 

"I  think  it  better  to  defer  giving  an  opinion  as  to  whether  any  further 
measures  may be necessary to check bribery and corruption. I will only say  10 
that  the  subject  is  one  of  the  highest  importance." 

It  is  impossible  to  describe  the  cool  amazement  with  which  this  speech 
of finality-John was received by the House of Commons. It would be difficult 
to  state,  which  was  greater,  the  perplexity  of  his  friends,  or  the  hilarity  of 
his  foes.  All  seemed  to  regard  his  speech  as  a complete  refutation of  Lu-  15 
cretius's  doctrine,  that  "Nil de nihilo fit.  " L o rd John at least made  something 
out  of  nothing;  a  dry,  long  and  very  tedious  speech. 

There  were  two  subjects  upon  which  Ministers  were  supposed  to  mean 
to  stand  or  fall—a new assessment of the Income Tax and a new Reform bill. 
Now as to the Income Tax it is proposed to continue it for a year in its present  20 
form.  As  to  a  reform  bill,  even  of  Whig  dimensions,  it  is  declared  that 
Ministers  intend  to  introduce  it  only  on  the  condition  that  they  remain  in 
office  for  a  whole  year.  It  is  altogether  the  programme  of  the  late  Russell 
Administration,  minus  the  Reform  Bill.  Even  the  financial  statement  is 
postponed  till  after the  Easter recess,  so that Ministers  may be  able, in any  25 
event  to  touch  their  quarterly  pay. 

The  particular  reform  propositions  are  nearly  all of  them  borrowed from 
Mr.D'Israeli's  programme.  Thus  for  instance,  the  law  amendment,  the 
abolition of  transportation to Australia, the Pilotage bill, the  Committee on 
the  Tenant-Right  question,  etc.  The  only  points  belonging  properly  to  the  30 
present  Ministry,  are  the  proposed  educational  reform  which  Lord  John 
assures us  will be  of  no larger  size than himself,  and the removal of Baronet 
Lionel  Rothschild's  disabilities.  It  may  be  questioned, whether the  English 
people  will be  very  contented with this extension of the  suffrage to  a Jewish 
usurer, who was notoriously one of the accomplices of the Bonapartist coup  35 
d'état. 

This  impudence  of  a  Ministry,  composed  of  two  parties  that  were  com- 
pletely  beaten  at  the  late  general  elections,  it  would be  difficult to  explain, 
were it not for the circumstance that any new Reform bill would necessitate 
a dissolution of the  present House of Commons, the majority of which stick  40 
to  their  dearly-bought  seats,  gained  by  narrow  majorities.

The  Italian  Insurrection—British  Politics 

Nothing  is  more  delightful  than the  manner  in  which  The  Times attempts 

to  comfort  its  readers: 

"Next session is not quite so uncertain an epoch as to-morrow; f or to-mor 
row  depends  not  only  on the  will,  but  even on  the  life  of the procrastinator, 
while  if  the  world  endures,  next  session will  certainly  arrive.  Then put off 
to next session—the whole Parliamentary reform—give the Ministry a rest for 
one  year?" 

I, for my part,  am of opinion, that it is highly beneficial to the people, that 
no  Reform bill  is  to be  octroyed by  Ministers, in the present dull  state of the 
public  mind,  and  "under  the  cold  shadow  of an aristocratic  Coalition  Cabi 
net."  It must not be forgotten that Lord Aberdeen was  a member of the Tory 
Cabinet, which, in  1830, refused to agree to any measure of reform. National 
reforms  must be won by National agitation, and not by the grace of my Lord 
Aberdeen. 

In  conclusion  let  me  mention  that,  at  a  special  meeting  of  the  General 
Committee  of  the  National  Association  for  the  Protection  of  British  Industry 
and  Capital,  held  in the  South-Sea House,  on  Monday  last, under  the  Presi 
dency  of  the  Duke  of  Richmond,  this  Society  wisely  resolved  to  dissolve 
itself.

The Attack on Francis Joseph— 
The  Milan Riot-British Politics-
Disraeli's  Speech—Napoleon's  Will. 

Correspondence  of  The  N.Y.Tribune. 

London,  Tuesday,  Feb. 22,  1853.

The  electric  telegraph  brings  the following  news  from  Stuhlweissenburg: 

"On  the  18th  inst.,  at  1  o'clock, the  Emperor of Austria,  Francis Joseph, 
was  walking on the ramparts  of Vienna, when a Hungarian journeyman tailor 
named  Lasslo  Libenyi,  formerly  a hussar from  Vienna,  rushed upon  him  in 
a  moment  and  struck  him  with  a  poniard.  The  blow  was  warded  off  by  an  10 
aid-de-camp,  the  Count  O'Donnell.  Francis  Joseph was  wounded below the 
occiput.  The  Hungarian,  21  years  of  age,  was  struck down by a blow of  the 
aid-de-camp's  sword  and  was  arrested  immediately." 

According  to  other  accounts,  tjje  weapon  employed  was  a  musket. 
A  very  extensive  conspiracy  for  the  overthrow  of  the  Austrian rule  has  15 

just  been  discovered  in  Hungary. 

The  Wiener Zeitung publishes  several  sentences  passed  by  courts  martial 
on  thirty-nine  individuals,  accused  principally  of  conspiracy  with  Kossuth 
and  Ruszak,  from  Hamburg. 

Immediately  after the revolutionary  outbreak in Milan  had been crushed,  20 

Radetzky  gave  orders  to  intercept  all  communication  with  Piedmont  and 
Switzerland.  You will  ere  this have received the  scanty information that has 
been  allowed  to  find  its  way  from  Italy  to  England.  I call your attention  to 
one  characteristic  feature  in  the  Milan  affair. 

Lieutenant-Marshal  Count  Strassoldo,  in  his  first  decree of the 6th inst.,  25 

although imposing the  severest state of siege upon Milan, plainly admits that 

42 

The  Attack  on  Francis  Joseph—The  Milan  Riot—British  Politics—Napoleon's  Will 

5 

the  bulk  of  the  population  took  no  part  whatever  in  the  late  insurrection. 
Radetzky, in his  subsequent proclamation of the 9th inst., dated from Verona, 
subverts  the  statement  of  his  inferior,  and takes  advantage  of the  rebellion 
to  obtain  money  under  false  pretenses.  He  subjects  all  persons  not  noto-
riously  belonging  to  the  Austrian party to fines  of unlimited  extent, for the 
benefit of the garrison. In his proclamation of the  11th inst.  he declares "that 
the  generality  of  the  inhabitants,  with  a few  praiseworthy  exceptions,  are 
unwilling  to  submit  to  the  Imperial  rule,"  and  he  instructs  all  judicial  au 
thorities,  i.e.  the  courts  martial,  to  sequestrate  the  property  of  all  the  ac-

10  complices,  explaining this  term in the  following  manner: 

"Che  tale  complicità  consista  semplicimente  nella  omissione  della  de 

nuncia  a  cui  ognuno  è  tenuto." 

He  might  as  well  have  confiscated  all  Milan  at  once  under  the  pretense 
that,  the  insurrection  having broken  out on the 6th,  its inhabitants  failed to 
15  denounce  it on the  5th.  Whoever will not become a spy and informer for the 
Hapsburg  shall be  liable  to  become  the  lawful prey  of the  Croat.  In  a word, 
Radetzky  proclaims  a  new  system  of  wholesale  plunder. 

20 

The  Milan  insurrection  is  significant  as  a  symptom  of  the  approaching 
revolutionary  crisis  on  the  whole  European  continent.  As the heroic act of 
some few proletarians—the sons of Mammon were dancing, and singing, and 
feasting  amid  the  blood  and  tears  of  their  debased  and  crucified  nation-
proletarians  who,  armed  only  with knives,  marched to  attack the  citadel of 
a  garrison  and  surrounding  army  of  forty  thousand  of  the  finest  troops  in 
Europe,  it  is  admirable.  But  as  the  finale  of  Mazzini's  eternal  conspiracy, 
25  of  his  bombastic  proclamations  and  his  arrogant  capucinades  against  the 
French people, it is a very poor result. Let us hope that henceforth there will 
be  an  end  of  révolutions improvisées,  as  the  French  call  them.  Has  one  ever 
heard  of  great  improvisators  being  also  great  poets?  They  are  the  same  in 
politics  as  in poetry.  Revolutions  are  never made to order.  After the terrible 
30  experience  of  '48  and  '49,  it needs  something more than paper  summonses 
from  distant  leaders  to  evoke  national  revolutions.  Kossuth  has  seized  the 
opportunity  for  publicly  disavowing  the  insurrection  in  general,  and  the 
proclamation  published  in  his  name  in  particular.  It looks,  however,  rather 
suspicious  that  he  claims  for  himself  a post-factum  superiority to  his friend 

35  Mazzini  as  a  politician.  The  Leader remarks  on this  subject: 

"We  deem  it necessary to  caution our readers  that the  matter  in question 
lies  exclusively between  Mr. Kossuth  and  Mr. Mazzini,  the  latter  of  whom 
is  absent  from  England." 

Della  Rocca,  a  friend  of  Mazzini,  says  in  a  letter  addressed  to  The  Daily 

40  News,  with  regard  to  Mr. Kossuth's  and  Mr. Agostini's  disavowals: 

"There  are  persons who  will  suspect that they were waiting the definitive 

43 

Karl  Marx 

news  of  the  success  or the failure  of the insurrection,  as ready to  share the 
honor  of  the  former  as  to  repel  the  responsibility of the latter."  B.  Szemere, 
Ex-Minister  of  Hungary,  protests  in  a letter  addressed  to  the  editor  of  the 
Morning  Chronicle,  "against  the  illegitimate  usurpation  of  the  name  of 
Hungary  by  Kossuth."  He  says:  "Let those  who  are  desirous  of forming a 
judgment  of  him  as  a  statesman,  read  attentively  the  history  of  the  last 
Hungarian  Revolution, or of learning his  skill  as  a conspirator, cast a retro 
spective  glance  on  the  unhappy  Hamburg  expedition  of  last  year." 

That  the  revolution is  victorious even in its failures, one may  see from the 
terrors  the  Milan  échauffourée  has  thrown  in  the  very heart of  continental 
potentates.  Look  only  at  the  following letter published in the  official  Frank 
furter 

Oberpostamts-Zeitung: 

5 

10 

"Berlin,  Feb.  13—The  events  at  Milan  have  produced  a  deep  impression 
here.  The  news  reached  the  King  by  telegraph  on the 9th,  just as the court 
was in the middle of a ball. The King immediately declared that the movement 15 
was  connected  with  a  deep  conspiracy,  which  had  its  ramification  every 
where,  and  that  it  showed  the  necessity  for  the  close  union  of Prussia and 
Austria in presence  of these revolutionary  movements 
A  high function 
ary exclaimed : 'We may thus have to defend the Prussian crown on the banks 
of the  P o . '" 

20 

So  great  was  the  alarm  created  in  the  first  moment,  that  about  twenty 
inhabitants  of  Berlin were  arrested without any  other  cause than the  "deep 
impression."  The  Neue  Preussische  Zeitung,  the  ultra  Royalist  paper,  was 
confiscated  for  pubUsbing  the  document purporting to be from Kossuth.  On 
the  13th the  Minister von Westphalen presented to the first chamber a hasty  25 
bill  for  empowering  the  Government to  seize  all  papers  or  pamphlets  pub 
lished  outside  the  frontiers  of  Prussia.  Arrests  and domiciliary visits are the 
order  of  the  day  at  Vienna.  Negotiations  immediately  took place  between 
Russia,  Prussia  and  Austria,  for  a joint remonstrance  to be  addressed to the 
British Government on the  subject of political refugees.  So weak,  so power-  30 
less  are  the  so-called  "powers."  They feel  the  thrones  of  Europe  vibrate  to 
their  foundations  at  the  first  forebodings  of  the  revolutionary  earthquake. 
In the  midst of their armies, their gallows  and their dungeons, they are trem 
bling at what they call  "the  subversive attempts of afew paid miscreants." 

"Quiet is restored." It is.  The ominous and dreadful quiet that intervenes  35 

between  the  first  burst  of  the  tempest  and  its  returning  roar. 

From the  agitated  scenes of the Continent I pass to quiet England. It would 
seem  as  if  the  spirit  of  little  Finality-John  had  obtained  the  whole  of  the 
official  sphere for its dominion;  as though the nation throughout had become 
as  paralytic  as  the  men  who  now govern it.  Even  The  Times exclaims  with  40 
despair: 

44 

The  Attack  on  Francis  Joseph—The  Milan  Riot—British  Politics—Napoleon's  Will 

"It  may  be  the  calm  before  a  storm;  it may be  the  smoke  before  the fire. 

. ..  For  the  present  it  is  dullness." 

Business  has  been  resumed  in  Parliament,  but  till  now  the  three  times 
repeated bowing of Lord Aberdeen has been the  most dramatic, and the only 
5  conspicuous  act  of  the  Coalition-Ministry.  The  impression  Lord  John's 
programme  has  made  on his  enemies  has been best described by the profes 
sions  of  his  friends: 

"Lord John Russell,"  says  The  Times,  "has  made  a speech with rather less 
spirit  than  an  ordinary  auctioneer  would  put  into  his  prehminary  remarks 
10  before  a  sale of old furniture, damaged goods, or shop fittings... Lord John 

Russell  creates  mighty  little  enthusiasm." 

You know  that the new Reform bill has been postponed under the presence 
of  more urgent practical reforms calling upon the more immediate attention 
of legislators.  Now  an instance  has  already been given of what nature these 
reforms  must turn out to be,  while the instrument of reforming, viz., Parlia 
ment,  remains  itself  unreformed. 

15 

On  Feb.  14,  Lord  Cranworth  laid  his  programme  of  legal  reform  before 

the  House  of Lords.  By far the greater part of his  prolix, tedious,  and inde 
cisive  speech  consisted  in  the  enumeration  of  the  many  things  he  was  ex-
20  pected,  but  not  at  all  prepared  to  do.  He  excused  himself  with  being  only 
seven weeks  on the woolsack, but, as  The  Times observes, "Lord Cranworth 
has  been  63  years  in  this  world,  and  37  at  the  Bar."  In  the  true  spirit  of 
Whiggery,  he  infers  from  the  comparatively  great  results  obtained  by  the 
small legal  reforms  hitherto  made,  that it would be  an  infraction of the laws 
25 of modesty to go on reforming in the same strain. In the true spirit of Aristoc 
racy, he abstains from dealing with Ecclesiastical Law, as "It would interfere 
too  much  with  vested  interests."  Interests  vested  in  what?  In  public  nui 
sances.  The  only  measures  of  any  importance  prepared by Lord Cranworth 
are  the  following  two:  Firstly,  a "Bill to facilitate  the  transfer of land,"  the 
30  principal features of which are, that it renders the transfer of land only more 
difficult,  by  increasing  the  expenses  thereon,  and  augmenting the  technical 
obstructions,  without  shortening  the  length,  or  diminishing  the  complexity 
of  conveyances.  Second,  a  proposition  to  form  a commission for  digesting 
the  statute law, the whole merit of which will be restricted to the compilation 
35  of  an index for  the  40 quarto  volumes of  statutes  at large.  Lord Cranworth 
certainly  may  defend  his  measures  against  the  most  inveterate  opponents 
to  law-reform  with  the  same  excuse  which  was  offered  by  the  poor  girl to 
her  Confessor,  namely:  that,  though  it  was  true  that  she  had had  a child, it 
was  but  a  very  little  one.

Up to this day the only interesting debate in the House of Commons was 
that  in  which  Mr. Disraeli,  on  the  18th  inst.,  interpellated  the  Ministers  on 

45 

Karl  Marx 

the  relations  of  the  country  with  France.  Disraeli  began  with  Poitiers  and 
Agincourt,  and  ended  with  the  hustings  at  Carlisle,  and  the  Cloth-Hall  at 
Halifax,  his  object  being  to  denounce  Sir  James  Graham  and  Sir  Charles 
Wood for irreverent remarks made on the character of Napoleon ΠΙ. Disraeli 
could not have rendered the  utter decay of the old Tory party more evident, 
than  by  his  throwing  himself  up  as  the  apologist  of  the  Bonapartes,  the 
hereditary  enemies  of  the  very  political  class  whose  chief  he  himself  is.  He 
could not have opened his opposition career in a more inappropriate manner, 
than  by  this  justification  of  the  actual  regime  in  France.  The  weakness  of 
this  part  of  his  speech  may  be  seen from  a  short  analysis  of  it.

Attempting  to  explain  the  causes  of  the  uneasiness  felt  by  the  public on 
the  state  of  England's  present  relations  with  France,  he  was  compelled  to 
admit  that  the principal motive was  just  derived from  the  large  armaments, 
which  were  commenced  under  his  own  administration.  Nevertheless  he 
endeavored  to  prove,  that  the  increasing  and  completing  the  defenses  of  15 
Great  Britain  had  their  only  reason  in  the  great changes  occasioned by the 
modern application of  science  to  the  art of  war. Competent authorities, he 
says,  had  ere  this  recognized  the necessity of such measures. In  1840, under 
the  Ministry  of M. Thiers, there had been made  some efforts by the Govern­
ment  of  Sir Robert Peel,  at least to commence a new  system with regard to  20 
the  public  defenses.  But  in  vain.  Again,  at the  outbreak  of the  Continental 
revolutions  in  1848,  an opportunity had been offered to the  Government of 
the  day  to  lead  popular  opinion  in the  direction which  it  desired,  as  far  as 
the  defense  of  the  country  was  concerned.  But  again  without  result.  The 
question  of  national  defenses  had  not  become  ripe  before  he  and  his  col-  25 
leagues were placed at the head of the Government. The measures, adopted 
by  them  were  as  follows: 

I. A  Militia  was  established. 
II. The  Artillery  was  placed  in  an  efficient  state. 
III. Measures  were  introduced  which  will  completely fortify the Arsenals 

30 

of  the  country,  and  some  important  strong  posts  upon  the  coast. 

TV.  A  proposition  was  made  by  which  will  be  added  to  the  Navy 

5,000  sailors  and  1,500  marines. 

V.  Arrangements  were  made  for  the  establishment  of  the ancient force in 
the  form  of  a  Channel  Fleet  of  15  or  20  sail  of  the  line  with  an  adequate  35 
number  of  frigates  and  smaller  ships. 

Now,  from  all  these  statements,  it  is  evident  that  Disraeli  established 
exactly  the  contrary  of  what  he  wanted  to  prove.  The  Government  was 
unable  to  effect  an  increase  of  armaments,  when  the  Syrian  and  Tahitian 
questions  menaced  the  entente  cordiale with  Louis  Philippe;  it  was  equally 
unable  to  do  so  when Revolution  spread all over the  Continent and  seemed 

40 

46 

The  Attack  on  Francis  Joseph—The  Milan  Riot—British  Politics—Napoleon's  Will 

to  threaten  British  interests  at  their  very  root.  Why,  then,  has  it  become 
possible  to  do  so  now,  and  why  was it  done  by  Mr. Disraeli's  Government? 
Exactly  because  Napoleon  III.  has  raised  more  fears  for  the  security  of 
England than have existed at any time since  1815. And further, as Mr. Cobden 
justly  observed: 

5 

"The  proposed  increase  in  the  naval force was  not an increase  of  steam-
machinery, but one of men, and the transition from the use of  sailing-vessels 
to  that  of  steamers  did  not  imply  the necessity of a larger number of  sailors, 
but  quite  the  contrary." 

io 

Disraeli  said: 
"Another  cause  for  the  belief  in  an  impending  rupture  with  France  was 
the  existence  in  France  of  a  military  government.  But  when  armies  were 
anxious  for  conquests,  it  was  because  their  position  at  home  was  uneasy; 
and  France  was  now  governed  by  the  army,  not  in  consequence  of  the 
15  military ambition of the troops, but in consequence of the disquietude of the 

citizens." 

Mr. Disraeli  seems  entirely to  overlook that the  question is just, how long 
the  army  will  feel  easy  at  home,  and  how  long  the  entire  Nation  will  bow, 
out  of  deference  to  the  egotistical  disquietude  of  a  small  class  of  citizens, 
to  the  actual  terrors  of  a  military  despotism,  which  after  all is  but  the  in 
strument  of  exclusive  class  interests. 

20 

The  third  cause  alleged  by  Mr. Disraeli  was: 
"The  considerable  prejudice  in  this  country  against  the  present  ruler  of 
France.  . ..  It  was  understood  that  in  acceding  to  power he had terminated 
25  with what  was here esteemed a Parliamentary Constitution and that he  had 

abrogated  the  liberty  of  the  press." 

There  is, however, but little which Mr. Disraeli knew of  to  oppose  to that 
prejudice.  He  said  "it  was  extremely  difficult to  form  an opinion on French 
politics." 

30 

It  is  simply  common-sense  which  tells  the  English people,  although less 
deeply  initiated  into the  mysteries  of  French politics than  Mr. Disraeli, that 
the reckless  adventurer, being neither  controlled by a Parliament nor a press, 
is  the  very  man  to  make  a  piratical  descent  upon  England,  after  his  own 
exchequer  has  become  exhausted  by  extravagance  and  dissipation. 

35 

Mr. Disraeli then records some instances, in which the cordial understand 
ing  between  Bonaparte  and  the  late  Administration had  greatly contributed 
toward  the  maintenance  of  peace,  as  in  the  case  of  an  impending  conflict 
between France and Switzerland, in the opening of the South America rivers, 
in  the  case  of  Prussia  and  Neufchatel,  in  pressing  upon  the  United  States 
40 the Tripartite renunciation of Cuba, in the common action in the Levant with 
regard  to  the  Tanzimat  in  Egypt,  in  the  revision  of  the  Greek  Succession 

47 

Karl  Marx 

Treaty,  in the  cordial cooperation with regard to  the  Regency  of Tunis,  etc. 
Now  this  reminds me of a certain member of the French party of order, who 
made  a  speech  at the  end of November,  1851,  on the cordial understanding 
between Bonaparte  and  the majority of the  Assembly which had enabled the 
latter  so  easily  to  dispose  of  the  Suffrage,  the  Association,  and the  Press 
questions.  Two  days  later  the  coup  d'état  had  been  carried  out. 

5 

Weak  and  inconsistent  as  was  this  part  of  Disraeli's  speech,  his  attacks 

on  the  Coalition  Ministry  formed  a  brilliant  conclusion: 

"There  is  one  other  reason,"  he  concluded,  "why  I  am  bound  to  pursue 
this inquiry at the present moment, and I find that reason in the present state 1 o 
of  parties  in  this  House.  It  is  a  peculiar  state  of  things.  We  have  at  this 
moment  a  Conservative  Ministry,  and we  have  a Conservative  Opposition. 
(Cheers.) Where  the  great  Liberal party is,  I pretend not to  know.  (Cheers.) 
Where  are  the  Whigs,  with  their  great  traditions?  . ..  There  is  no  one  to 
answer.  (Renewed  cheering.)  Where,  I  ask,  are  the  youthful  energies  of  15 
Radicalism?  Its  buoyant  expectations—its  expanded  hopes?  Awakened,  I 
fear,  from  the  dreams  of  that  ardent  inexperience which  attend  sometimes 
the  career  of  youth,  it  finds  itself  at the  same  moment used  and  discarded. 
(Cheers.)  Used  without  compunction,  and  not  discarded  with  too  much 
decency.  (Cheers.) Where are the Radicals? Is there a man in the House who  20 
declares  himself  a  Radical?  (Hear,  hear!)  No,  not  one.  He  would  be  afraid 
of being caught and turned into a Conservative  Minister.  (Roars of laughter.) 
Well,  how  has  this  curious  state  of things been brought about? Where is the 
machinery by  which  it has  been effected, this portentous political calamity? 
I  believe  I must  go  to  that  inexhaustible  magazine  of political  devices,  the  25 
First  Lord  of  the  Admiralty  (Graham) to explain the present state of affairs. 
The  House  may  recollect  that  some  two  years  ago  the  First  Lord  of  the 
Admiralty  afforded us,  as  is  his wont,  one of those political creeds in which 
his  speeches  abound.  He  said:  Ί  take  my  stand  on  progress.'  Well,  Sir,  I 
thought at the time that progress  was  an odd thing to take one's stand upon.  30 
(Much  laughter  and  cheering.)  I  thought  at  the  time  that this  was  a piece  of 
oratorical  slip-slop.  But I  apologize for the momentary suspicion. I find that 
it was  a  system perfectly matured and now brought into  action.  For we have 
now a Ministry of progress,  and  every one stands  still.  (Cheers.) We never 
hear  the  word  Reform  now;  it  is  no  longer  a  Ministry  of  Reform;  it  is  a  35 
Ministry  of  Progress,  every  member  of  which  resolves  to  do  nothing.  All 
difficult  questions  are  superseded.  All  questions  which  cannot  be  agreed 
upon,  are  open  questions." 

The  opponents  of  Disraeli  had  but  little  to  say  in  reply  to  him,  with  the 

exception  of  that  very  "inexhaustible  magazine  of  political  devices,"  Sir  40 
James Graham, who,  at least, conserved his  dignity in not wholly retracting 

48 

The  Attack  on  Francis  Joseph—The  Milan  Riot—British  Politics—Napoleon's  Will 

the  offensive  words  against  Louis  Napoleon,  of  which  he  had  been  ac 
cused. 

Lord  John  Russell  charged  Mr. Disraeli with  making  a  party-question  of 

the  country's  foreign  policy,  and  assured  the  Opposition: 

"That  after  the  contentions  and  struggles  of  last  year  the  country  would 
gladly  see  a  short  time  at least of peaceable progress,  without any  of those 
great  convulsive  struggles  of  parties." 

The  result  of  the  debate  is,  that  the  whole  of  the  navy-estimates  will  be 
voted by the House, but to the comfort of Louis Napoleon, not from a warlike 
but  only  a  scientific  view  of  the  matter.  Suaviter in modo,  farther  in re.  On 
Thursday  morning last, the  Queen's  Advocate,  appearing before  Sir J. Dod-
son,  in  the  Prerogative  Court,  requested,  on  behalf  of  the  Secretary  of 
Foreign  Affairs,  that  the  original  will  and  codicil  of  Napoleon  Bonaparte 
should  be  delivered  up  by  the  Register  to  the  French  Government;  which 
desire  was  complied  with.  Should  Louis  Bonaparte  proceed  to  open  and 
endeavor  to  execute  this  testament,  it might prove  the  modern box of Pan 
dora.

The Parliamentary debates of the week offer but little of interest.  On the 22d 
inst.  Mr. Spooner moved, in the House of Commons, the repeal of the money 
grants  for  the  Catholic  College  at Maynooth,  and  Mr. Scholefield proposed 
the  amendment "to  repeal  all enactments now in force whereby the revenue 
of  the  State  is  charged  in  aid  of  any  ecclesiastical  or  religious  purpose 
whatever."  Mr. Spooner's  motion  was lost by  162 to  192 votes.  Mr. Schole-  10 
field's  amendment will  not  come  under  discussion before  Wednesday  next; 
it  is,  however,  not  improbable  that  the  amendment  will be  withdrawn alto 
gether.  The  only remarkable  passage  in the Maynooth debate is an observa 
tion  that  fell  from  Mr. Duffy  (Irish  Brigade:)  "He  did  not  tliink  it  wholly 
impossible  that  the  President  of  the  United  States  or  the  new  Emperor  of  15 
the French,  might be glad to renew the relations between those countries and 
the  Irish  Priesthood." 

In  the  session  of  last  night  Lord  John  Russell  brought before  the  House 
of  Commons  his  motion  for  the  "removal  of  some  disabilities  of  Her  Ma 
jesty's  Jewish  subjects." The motion was carried by  a majority of 29.  Thus  20 
the  question is again settled in the House of Commons, but there is no doubt 
that  it  will  be  once  more  unsettled  in  the  House  of  Lords. 

The  exclusion  of  Jews  from  the  House  of  Commons,  after  the  spirit  of 
usury  has  so  long  presided  in  the  British  Parliament,  is  unquestionably  an 
absurd anomaly, the more  so  as  they have  already become eligible to all the  25 
civil  offices  of  the  community.  But it remains  no  less  characteristic  for the 
man  and  for  his  times,  that  instead  of  a  Reform  bill  which was  promised  to 

50 

Parliamentary  Debates—The  Clergy  against  Socialism—Starvation 

remove  the  disabüities  of  the  mass  of  the  English  people,  a bill  is  brought 
in  by  Finality  John  for  the  exclusive  removal  of  the  disabilities  of  Baron 
Lionel  de  Rothschild.  How  utterly  insignificant  an  interest  is  taken  in  this 
affair  by  the  public  at  large,  may  be  inferred  from  the  fact that from  not  a 
single place in Great Britain a petition in favor of the admission of Jews has 
been  forwarded  to  Parliament.  The  whole  secret  of  this  miserable  reform 
farce  was  betrayed  by  the  speech  of  the  present  Sir  Robert  Peel.

"After  all,  the  House  were  only  considering  the  noble  Lord's  private 
affairs.  (Loud  cheers.)  The  noble  Lord  represented  London  with  a  Jew, 
1 o (cheers) and had made the pledge to bring forward annually a motion in favor 
of  the  Jews.  (Hear!)  No  doubt  Baron  Rothschild  was  a very  wealthy  man, 
but this  did not entitle  him  to  any consideration, especially considering how 
his  welath  had  been  amassed.  (Loud  cries  of  "hear,  hear,"  and  "Oh!  Oh!" 
from  the  Ministerial benches.) Only yesterday he had read in the papers that 
the  House  of  Rothschild  had  consented to  grant  a  loan to  Greece,  on con 
siderable  guaranties,  at  9%.  (Hear!)  No wonder,  at this  rate,  that the  house 
of  Rothschild  were  wealthy.  (Hear!)  The  President  of the  Board  of  Control 
had  been  talking  of  gagging  the  Press.  Why,  no  one  had  done  so  much  to 
depress  freedom  in  Europe  as  the  house  of Rothschild  (Hear,  hear!)  by  the 
loans with which they assisted the  despotic powers. But even supposing the 
Baron  to  be  as  worthy  a  man  as  he  was  certainly  rich,  it was to  have been 
expected  that  the  noble  Lord who  represented  in  that House  a government 
consisting  of  the  leaders  of  all  the  political  factions  who  had  opposed  the 
late Administration, would have proposed some measure of more importance 
than the present." 

25 

20 

The proceedings on election-petitions have commenced. The elections for 
Canterbury  and  Lancaster  have  been  declared  null  and  void,  under circum 
stances  which  proved  the  habitual  venality on the  part of  a certain  class  of 
electors,  but  it  is  pretty  sure  that  the  majority  of  cases will be  adjusted by 

30  way of compromise. 

"The  privileged  classes,"  says  The  Daily News  "who  have  successfully 
contributed  to  baffle  the  intentions  of  the  Reform  Bill  and to  recover their 
ascendency  in  the  existing representation,  are  naturally alarmed  at the  idea 
of  full  and  complete  exposure." 

35 

On  the  21st  inst.,  Lord  John  Russell  resigned  the  seals  of  the  Foreign 
Office,  and  Lord  Clarendon  was  sworn in as his  successor.  Lord John is the 
first  Member  of  the  House  of  Commons  admitted  to  a  seat  in  the  Cabinet 
without  any  official appointment.  He is now only a favorite adviser, without 
a  place—and  without  salary.  Notice,  however,  has  already  been  given  by 
40  Mr.Cayley  of  a  proposition  to  remedy  the  latter  inconvenience  of  poor 
Johnny's  situation.  The  Secretaryship  of  Foreign  Affairs  is  at  the  present 

51 

Karl  Marx 

juncture  the more important, as the Germanic Diet has bestirred itself to ask 
the  removal  of  all  political  refugees  from  Great  Britain,  as  the  Austrians 
propose  to pack us all up  and transport us to  some barren island in the  South 
Pacific.

Allusion  has  been  made,  in a former letter, to  the probability of the  Irish 
Tenant-Right  agitation  becoming,  in  time,  an  anti-clerical  movement,  not 
withstanding the views  and intentions of its actual leaders. I alleged the fact, 
that the  higher  Clergy  was  already  beginning to take  a hostile  attitude with 
regard  to  the  League.  Another  force  has  since  stepped into the field which 
presses  the  movement in the  same  direction.  The  landlords of the north of  10 
Ireland  endeavor  to persuade their tenantry, that the Tenant League  and the 
Catholic  Defense  Association  are  identical,  and  they  labor  to  get  up  an 
opposition  to  the  former  under  the  pretense  of  resisting  the  progress  of 
Popery. 

While we thus see the Irish landlords appealing to their tenants against the  15 

Catholic  clergy  we  behold  on  the  other  hand  the  English  Protestant clergy 
appealing  to  the  working  classes  against  the  mill-lords.  The  industrial  pro 
letariat  of  England  has  renewed  with  double  vigor its  old campaign  for the 
Ten  hours  Bill  and  against  the  truck and stoppage  system.  As  the  demands 
of this kind shall be brought before the House of Commons, to which numer-  20 
ous  petitions  on  the  subject  have  already  been  presented,  there  will  be  an 
opportunity  for  me  to  dwell  in  a  future  letter  on  the  cruel  and  infamous 
practices  of  the  factory-despots,  who  are  in  the  habit  of  making  the  press 
and the tribune resounding with their liberal rhetorics.  For the present it may 
suffice  to  recall  to  memory that from  1802  there  has  been a continual  strife  25 
on  the  part  of  the  English  working  people  for  legislative  interference  with 
the  duration  of  factory  labor,  until in  1847  the  celebrated Ten-hours  Act of 
John Fielden was passed, whereby young persons and females were prohibit 
ed  to  work in  any factory  longer  than  ten  hours  a day.  The liberal mill-lords 
speedily  found  out  that under  this  act factories  might be  worked by  shifts  30 
and  relays.  In  1849  an  action  of  law  was  brought  before  the  Court  of  Ex 
chequer,  and the Judge  decided,  that to  work the relay or shift-system, with 
two  sets of children, the  adults working the whole space of time during which 
the  machinery  was  ranning,  was legal.  It therefore became  necessary to  go 
to  Parliament again,  and in  1850 the relay and  shift-system was  condemned  35 
there,  but  the  Ten  Hours  act was  transformed into  a Ten  and  a Half  Hours 
act.  Now,  at  this  moment,  the  working-classes  demand  a  restitution  in  in 
tegrum of  the  original  Ten-Hours  bill;  yet,  in order to  make it efficient, they 
add  the  demand  of  a  restriction  of  the  moving  power  of  machinery. 

Such  is,  in  short,  the  exoteric  history  of  the  Ten  Hours  act.  Its  secret  40 

history  was  as follows:  The landed Aristocracy having suffered a defeat from 

52 

Parliamentary  Debates—The  Clergy  against  Socialism—Starvation

the bourgeoisie by the passing of  the Reform bill of  1831, and being assailed 
in  "their most sacred interests" by the cry of the manufacturers for free-trade 
and  the  abolition  of  the  Corn-Laws,  resolved  to  resist  the  middle-class  by 
espousing  the  cause  and  claims  of  the  working  men  against  their  masters, 
and  especially by rallying  around their demands for the limitation of factory 
labor.  So-called  philanthropic  Lords  were  then  at the head of all Ten-Hours 
meetings.  Lord  Ashley  has  even  made  a  sort  of  "renommée"  by  his  per 
formances  in  this  movement.  The  landed  aristocracy  having  received  a 
deadly  blow  by  the  actual  abolition  of  the  Corn-laws  in  1846,  took  their 
10  vengeance  by  forcing  the  Ten  Hours  bill  of  1847  upon  Parliament.  But the 
industrial  bourgeoisie  recovered  by  judiciary  authority,  what  they  had  lost 
by Parliamentary legislation.  In  1850,  the wrath of the Landlords had gradu 
ally  subsided,  and they made  a compromise with the Mill-lords, condemning 
the  shift-system,  but  imposing,  at  the  same  time,  as  a  penalty  for  the  en-
forcement  of  the  law,  half  an  hour  extra  work  per  diem  on  the  working-
classes.  At the  present juncture,  however,  as they feel the approach of their 
final  struggle  with  the  men  of the  Manchester  school,  they  are  again trying 
to  get  hold  of  the  short-time  movement;  but,  not  daring  to  come  forward 
themselves,  they  endeavor  to  undermine  the  Cotton-lords  by  directing  the 
20  popular  force  against them through  the  medium of the  State Church  Clergy 
men.  In  what  rude  manner  these  holy  men  have  taken  the  anti-industrial 
crusade  into  their  hands,  may  be  seen from the  following few  instances.  At 
Crompton  a  Ten-Hours  meeting  was  held,  the  Rev. Dr. Brammall,  (of  the 
State  Church)  in  the  chair.  At this  meeting,  Rev. J. R. Stephens, Incumbent 

15 

25  of  Staleybridge,  said: 

"There  had  been  ages  in  the  world  when  the  nations  were  governed  by 
Theocracy  . ..  That  state  of  things  is  now  no  more  . ..  Still  the  spirit of law 
was the  s a m e . .. The laboring man should, first of all, be partaker of the fruits 
of the  earth,  which he  was  the  means  of producing.  The factory-law  was  so 
30  unblushingly  violated  that  the  Chief  Inspector  of  that  part  of  the  factory 
district,  Mr. Leonard  Horner,  had  found  himself necessitated to write to the 
Home-Secretary,  to  say  that  he  dared  not,  and  would  not  send  any  of  his 
Sub-Inspectors  into  certain  districts  until  he  had  police  protection  . ..  And 
protection  against  whom?  Against  the  factory-masters!  Against the richest 
35  men  in  the  district,  against the  most influential  men  in  the  district,  against 
the  magistrates  of  the  district,  against  the  men  who  hold  her  Majesty's 
Commission,  against  the  men  who  sat  in  the  Petty  Sessions  as  the  Repre 
sentatives  of  Royalty  . ..  And  did  the  masters  suffer  for  their  violation  of 
the  law?...  In  his  own  district,  it  was  a  settled  custom  of  the  male,  and  to 
40  a  great  extent  of  the  female  workers  in factories,  to  be  in bed  till  9,  10  or 
11  o'clock on  Sunday,  because  they were  tired out by the labor of the week. 

53 

Karl  Marx 

Sunday  was  the  only day  on which they  could  rest their wearied frames  . .. 
It  would  generally  be  found  that,  the  longer  the  time  of  work,  the  smaller 
the  wages  . ..  He  would  rather  be  a  slave in  South  Carolina,  than  a factory 
operative  in  England." 

At  the  great ten hours  meeting,  at Burnley, Rev. E. A. Verity, Incumbent 

5 

of  Habergham  Eaves,  told  his  audience  among  other  things: 

"Where  was  Mr.Cobden,  where  was  Mr. Bright,  where  were  the  other 
members  of  the  Manchester  School,  when  the  people  of  Lancashire  were 
oppressed?  . ..  What was  the  end  of  the  rich  man's thinking? Why,  he was 
scheming  how  he  could  defraud the working classes  out of an hour or two. 
That was  the  scheming of what he called the Manchester  School. That made 
them  such  cunning hypocrites,  and  such  crafty rascals.  As  a  minister  of  the 
Church  of  England,  he  protested  against  such  work." 

10 

The  motive,  that  has  so  suddenly  metamorphosed  the  gentlemen  of  the 
Established  Church  into  as  many  knight-errants  of  labor's  rights,  and  so  15 
fervent  knights  too,  has  already been pointed  out.  They  are  not only laying 
in  a  stock  of  popularity for the  rainy  days  of  approaching  Democracy,  they 
are  not only conscious,  that the  Established Church is  essentially an aristo 
cratic  institution,  which  must either stand or fall with the landed Oligarchy-
there is  something more. The men of the Manchester  School  are Anti-State  20 
Church-men,  they  are  Dissenters,  they  are,  above  all,  so  highly  enamored 
of  the  £13,000,000  annually  abstracted  from  their  pockets  by  the  State-
Church  in  England  and  Wales  alone,  that they  are  resolved  to  bring  about 
a  separation between those  profane  millions  and  the  holy orders,  the better 
to  qualify  the  latter  for  heaven.  The  reverend  gentlemen,  therefore,  are  25 
struggling  pro  aris  et focis.  The  men  of  the  Manchester  School,  however, 
may infer from this  diversion, that they will be unable to abstract the political 
power from the hands of the Aristocracy, unless they consent, with whatever 
reluctance,  to  give  the  people  also  their  full  share  in  it. 

On the  Continent,  hanging,  shooting and transportation is the order of the  30 

day.  But the  executioners  are themselves tangible  and hangable beings, and 
their  deeds  are  recorded  in  the  conscience  of the whole  civilized world.  At 
the  same time there acts in England an invisible, intangible and silent despot, 
condemning  individuals,  in  extreme  cases,  to  the  most cruel of  deaths,  and 
driving  in  its  noiseless,  every  day  working,  whole  races  and  whole  classes  35 
of  men from  the  soil  of  their  forefathers,  like  the  angel with the fiery sword 
who  drove  Adam  from  Paradise.  In  the  latter  form  the  work  of  the  unseen 
social  despot  calls  itself  forced emigration,  in  the  former  it  is  called  starva 
tion. 

Some  further  cases  of  starvation  have  occured  in  London  during  the  40 

present  month.  I  remember  only  that  of  Mary  Ann  Sandry,  aged  43  years, 

54 

Parliamentary  Debates—The  Clergy  against  Socialism—Starvation 

who  died  in  Coal-lane,  Shadwell, London.  Mr. Thomas Peene, the  surgeon, 
assisting  the  Coroner's  inquest,  said the  deceased  died from  starvation  and 
exposure  to  the  cold.  The  deceased  was  lying  on  a  small  heap  of  straw, 
without  the  slightest covering.  The  room  was  completely  destitute  of furni 
ture,  firing  and  food.  Five  young children were  sitting on the bare  flooring, 
crying  from  hunger  and  cold  by  the  side  of  the  mother's  dead  body.

Correspondence  of  The  N. Y. Tribune. 

London,  Friday,  March 4,  1853. 

From  the  accounts  relating  to  trade  and  navigation  for  the  years  1851  and 
1852,  published  in  Feb.  last,  we  see that the  total  declared value  of  exports 
amounted  to  £68,531,601  in  1851,  and  to  £71,429,548  in  1852;  of  the latter 
amount, £47,209,000 go to the export of cotton, wool, linen and silk manufac 
tures.  The  quantity of  imports for  1852  is  below  that for the  year  1851.  The 
proportion of imports  entered for home consumption not having diminished, 
but  rather  increased,  it  follows  that England  has  reexported,  instead  of  the 
usual  quantity  of  colonial  produce,  a  certain  amount  of  gold  and  silver. 

The  Colonial  Land  Emigration  Office  gives  the  following  return  of  the 
emigration from England,  Scotland and Ireland to all parts of the world, from 
Jan. 1,  1847, to June  30,  1852:

Forced  Emigration—Kossuth  and  Mazzini—The  Refugee  Question—Mr. Cobden 

"Nine  tenths,"  remarks  the  Office,  "of  the  emigrants  from  Liverpool  are 
assumed  to  be  Irish.  About three fourths of the emigrants from Scotland are 
Celts,  either  from  the  Highlands,  or  from  Ireland  through  Glasgow." 

5 

Nearly four fifths  of the whole emigration are,  accordingly, to be regarded 
as  belonging  to  the  Celtic  population  of  Ireland  and  of  the  Highlands  and 
islands  of  Scotland.  The  London  Economist  says  of  this  emigration: 

10 

"It  is  consequent on the  breaking  down of  the  system  of  society founded 
on  small  holdings  and potato cultivation;"  and adds:  "The  departure of the 
redundant  part  of  the  population  of  Ireland  and  the  Highlands  of  Scotland 
is an indispensable prehminary to every kind of improvement... The revenue 
of  Ireland  has  not  suffered in any degree from the famine of  1846-47, or from 
the  emigration  that  has  since  taken place.  On  the  contrary, her nett revenue 
amounted in  1851  to £4,281,999, being about£184,000 greater than in 1843." 

Begin  with pauperizing the  inhabitants  of  a country,  and when there is no 
15  more  profit  to  be  ground  out  of  them,  when  they  have  grown  a burden  to 
the  revenue,  drive  them  away,  and  sum  up  your  Net  Revenue!  Such is  the 
doctrine  laid  down  by  Ricardo,  in  his  celebrated  work,  The  Principles  of 
Political  Economy.  The  annual  profits  of  a  capitalist  amounting  to  £2,000, 
what  does  it  matter  to  him  whether  he  employs  100 men or  1,000 men?  "Is 
20  not,"  says  Ricardo,  "the  real  interest  of  a  nation  similar?"  The  net  real 
income  of  a  nation,  rents  and  profits,  remaining  the  same,  it  is  no  subject 
of  consideration  whether  it  is  derived  from  10  millions  of  people  or  from 
12  millions.  Sismondi, 
in  his  Nouveaux  Principes  d'Économie  Politique, 
answers  that,  according to  this view  of the matter, the English nation would 
25  not be interested at all in the disappearance of the whole population, the King 
(at  that time  it was  no  Queen,  but  a  King)  remaining  alone  in  the  midst  of 
the  island,  supposing  only  that automatic machinery enabled him to procure 
the  amount  of  Net Revenue  now  produced  by  a  population  of  20  millions. 
Indeed,  that  grammatical  entity,  the  "national  wealth,"  would  in  this  case 

30  not be  diminished. 

In  a former letter  I  have  given  an instance of the clearing of estates in the 
Highlands  of  Scotland.  That emigration continues to be forced upon Ireland 
by  the  same  process  you  may  see  from  the  following  quotation  from  The 
Galway  Mercury: 

35 

"The  people  are  fast passing  away from  the  land in the West of Ireland. 
The  landlords  of  Connaught are tacitly combined to weed out all the  smaller 
occupiers,  against whom  a regular  systematic  war  of extermination is being 
waged  . ..  The  most  heart-rending  cruelties  are  daily  practiced  in  this 
province,  of  which  the  public  are  not  at  all  aware." 

40 

But  it  is  not  only  the  pauperised  inhabitants  of  Green  Erin  and  of  the 
Highlands  of  Scotland  that  are  swept  away  by  agricultural  improvements, 

57 

Karl  Marx 

and  by  the  "breaking  down  of  the  antiquated  system  of  society."  It  is  not 
only  the  able-bodied  agricultural laborers from  England,  Wales,  and Lower 
Scotland,  whose  passages  are  paid by  the  Emigration Commissioners.  The 
wheel  of  "improvement"  is  now  seizing  another  class,  the  most  stationary 
class in England.  A startling emigration movement has sprung up among the 
smaller English farmers, especially those holding heavy clay soils, who, with 
bad  prospects  for  the  coming  harvest,  and  in  want  of  sufficient  capital  to 
make  the  great  improvements  on  their  farms  which would  enable  them  to 
pay  their  old  rents,  have  no  other  alternative but to  cross the  sea in  search 
of  a new  country  and of new lands. I am not speaking now of the emigration  10 
caused  by  the  gold  mania,  but  only  of  the  compulsory emigration  produced 
by landlordism, concentration of farms,  application of machinery to the soil, 
and  introduction  of  the  modern  system  of  agriculture  on  a great  scale. 

5 

In the  ancient States, in Greece and Rome, compulsory emigration assum 

ing the  shape  of  the  periodical  establishment  of colonies, formed a regular  15 
link in the  structure of  society.  The whole  system of those  States was found 
ed  on  certain  limits  to  the  numbers  of  the  population,  which  could  not  be 
surpassed  without  endangering  the  condition  of  antique  civilization  itself. 
But why was it  so?  Because the application of science to material production 
was utterly unknown to them. To remain civilized they were forced to remain 
few.  Otherwise  they would have had to  submit to the bodily drudgery which 
transformed the free citizen into a slave. The want of productive power made 
citizenship  dependent on a certain proportion in numbers not to be disturbed. 
Forced  emigration  was  the  only  remedy. 

20 

It was  the  same  pressure  of population  on the  powers  of production, that  25 

drove  the  barbarians  from  the  high plains  of Asia to  invade  the  Old World. 
The  same  cause  acted  there,  although  under  a  different  form.  To  remain 
barbarians  they  were  forced  to  remain  few.  They  were  pastoral,  hunting, 
war-waging  tribes,  whose  manner  of  production  required  a  large  space  for 
every individual, as is now the case with the Indian tribes in North-America.  30 
By  augmenting  in  numbers  they  curtailed  each  other's  field  of production. 
Thus the surplus population was forced to undertake those great adventurous 
migratory  movements  which  laid  the  foundation  of  the  peoples  of  ancient 
and  modern  Europe. 

But with  modern  compulsory  emigration the  case  stands  quite  opposite.  35 

Here  it  is  not the  want of productive  power which creates  a surplus popula 
tion;  it  is  the increase  of productive power which  demands  a diminution  of 
population,  and  drives  away  the  surplus  by  famine  or  emigration.  It  is  not 
population  that  presses  on  productive  power;  it  is  productive  power  that 
presses  on population. 

Now  I  share  neither in the  opinions  of Ricardo, who regards  "Net-Reve-

40 

58 

Forced  Emigration—Kossuth  and  Mazzini—The  Refugee  Question—Mr.  Cobden 

nue"  as  the  Moloch to  whom  entire  populations  must be  sacrificed, without 
even  so  much  as  complaint,  nor  in  the  opinion  of  Sismondi,  who,  in  his 
hypochondriacal  philanthropy,  would  forcibly  retain  the  superannuated 
methods of agriculture and proscribe science from industry, as Plato expelled 
5  poets  from  his  Republic.  Society  is  undergoing  a  süent  revolution,  which 
must  be  submitted  to,  and  which  takes  no  more  notice  of the  human exist 
ences  it breaks down than an earthquake regards the houses it subverts. The 
classes  and  the  races,  too  weak  to  master  the  new  conditions  of life,  must 
give  way.  But can there  be  anything more  puerile,  more  short-sighted,  than 
the  views  of  those  Economists  who  believe  in  all  earnest  that  this  woful 
transitory state means nothing but adapting society to the acquisitive propen 
sities  of  capitalists,  both  landlords  and  money-lords?  In  Great  Britain  the 
working  of  that  process  is  most  transparent.  The  application  of  modern 
science  to  production  clears  the  land  of  its  inhabitants,  but it concentrates 

10 

15  people  in manufacturing towns. 

"No  manufacturing  workmen,"  says  The Economist,  "have  been assisted 
by  the  Emigration  Commissioners,  except  a  few  Spitalfields  &  Paisley 
hand-loom  weavers,  and  few  or  none  have  emigrated  at  their  own  ex 
pense." 

20 

The  Economist knows  very well that they could not emigrate at their own 
expense,  and  that  the  industrial  middle-class  would  not assist them  in emi 
grating.  Now, to what does this lead? The rural population, the most station 
ary  and  conservative  element  of  modern  society,  disappears  while  the  in 
dustrial  proletariat,  by  the  very  working  of  modern  production,  finds  itself 
25  gathered  in mighty  centers,  around  the  great productive forces, whose  his 
tory  of creation has  hitherto been the martyrology of the laborers.  Who will 
prevent  them  from  going  a  step  further,  and  appropriating  these  forces,  to 
which  they  have  been  appropriated  before?  Where  will  be  the  power  of 
resisting them? Nowhere!  Then, it will be  of  no  use  to  appeal to  the  "rights 
30  of property."  The modern changes in the  art of production have,  according 
to  the  Bourgeois  Economists  themselves,  broken  down  the  antiquated 
system  of  society  and  its  modes  of  appropriation.  They  have  expropriated 
the  Scotch  clansmen,  the  Irish  cottier  and  tenant,  the  English yeoman,  the 
hand-loom  weaver,  numberless  handicrafts,  whole  generations  of  factory 
35  children and women; they will expropriate, in due time, the landlord and the 

cotton-lord. 

On  the  Continent heaven  is  fulminating,  but in  England  the  earth itself  is 
trembling.  England is the country where the real revulsion of modern society 
begins. 

40 

In  my  letter  of  the  1st  inst.  I  told  you  that  Mazzini  would  remonstrate 
publicly with Kossuth. On the 2d inst.  there  appeared actually in  The Morning 

59 

Karl  Marx 

Advertiser,  Morning Post  and  Daily  News  a  letter  from  Mazzini.  As  Mazzini 
himself  has  now  broken the  ice,  I may as well  state  that Kossuth disowned 
his  own  document under the  pressure  of his Paris friends.  In the past career 
of  Kossuth  we  find  many  such  symptoms  of  vacillating  weakness,  inex-
tribacle contradictions  and duplicity.  He possesses all the attractive virtues, 
but also  all the feminine faults  of the  "artiste" character. He is a great artist 
"en  paroles. "  I  recommend  Mr. Szemere's  lately  published  biographies  of 
Louis  Batthyány,  Arthur  Görgey  and Louis  Kossuth  to  those  who,  unwilling 
to  bow  to  popular  superstition,  are  anxious  to  form  a  matter-of-fact 
judgment. 

As  to  Lombardy,  you  may be  sure that, if  Mazzini has failed to  draw the 
Italian middle-classes  into  the  movement,  Radetzky will  not fail therein. At 
this  moment he is preparing to confiscate the property of all emigrants, even 
those  who  emigrated  with  Austrian  permission,  and  have  been  naturalized 
in  other  countries,  unless  they  prove  they  are  unconnected  with  the  late 
rising.  The  Austrian  papers  calculate  the  amount  of  confiscable  property at 
£12,000,000. 

Upon  a  question  put  by  Lord  Dudley  Stuart,  Lord  Palmerston  stated  in 

the  Session  of  the  House  of  Commons  of  March  1: 

5 

10 

15 

"That  no  application  for  the  expulsion of  the political refugees  had been 
made by the  Continental Powers,  or that, if  made, it would meet with a firm 
and  decided  refusal.  The  British  Government  had  never  undertaken  to  pro 
vide  for  the  internal  security  of  other  countries." 

20 

That  such an application, however, was intended to be made, you may see 
from  the  stock-jobbing  Moniteur  and  the  Journal  des  Débats,  which,  in  one 
of  its  last numbers,  supposes  England  already bowing to  the  joint demands 
of  Austria,  Russia,  Prussia  and  France.  That  journal  adds: 

25 

"If  the  Swiss  Confederation  should  refuse  to  allow  Austria to  exercise  a 
surveillance  over  the  Cantons  on  her  frontiers  she  will  probably  violate  the 
Swiss  territory  and  occupy  the  Canton  of  Tessin; in which case  France, to  30 
preserve  a  political  equilibrium,  would  force  her  armies  into  the  Swiss 
Cantons  on  her  frontiers." 

In  substance,  the  Journal des Débats gives with regard to  Switzerland, that 
simple  solution of the question jocosely proposed by Prince Henry of Prussia 
to  the  Empress  Catherine  in  1770,  with  regard to Poland.  In the  mean time  35 
the  venerable  body  called  the  German  Diet,  is  gravely  discussing  on  "the 
application  about  to  be  made  to  England,"  and expends  as  much breath on 
this  solemn matter,  as  would  suffice  to  swell the  sails  of the whole German 
fleet. 

In  the  Session  of  the  House  of Commons  of the  1st inst., there occurred  40 

a very  characteristic  incident. The representatives of Bridgenorth and Black-

60 

Forced  Emigration—Kossuth  and  Mazzini—The  Refugee  Question—Mr. Cobden 

burn  having  been  declared  unduly  elected  on  the  ground  of  bribery,  Sir 
J.  Shelley moved that the evidence taken before their respective Committees, 
should be  laid  upon the  table  of  the  House,  and  that the writs for reelection 
be  suspended  until  the  4th of April.  The  Right  Hon.  Baronet  Sir J.Trollope 
5 remarked withregard to this: "That 14 Committees had already been appoint 
ed  to  try  boroughs  for  corrupt  practices,  and  that  about 50  more remained 
to  be  appointed,"  and  he  spoke  of  the  difficulty  in finding members enough 
in  the  House  to  constitute  tribunals  to  judge  the  disputed  elections,  and  at 
the  same  time  to  form  Committees for the  ordinary business  of  the  House. 
10  Sifting  a little  deeper into its own foundation, a breaking down of the House 

must  ensue,  and  the  parliamentary  machinery  come  to  a  dead  lock. 

In his recent pamphlet, as well as in his harangues, at the Manchester Peace 
Congress,  and  at  various  Educational  Meetings,  Mr. Cobden  has  amused 
himself  with  censuring  the  Press.  The  whole  Press  has  retaliated upon him; 
15  but  the  most heavy blow  strikes  him  from  the hands  of the  "Englishman," 
whose  letters  on  Louis  Napoleon  elicited  such a sensation at the time of the 
Coup  d'Etat,  and  who  has  since  turned  round  upon  the  silken  Barons  and 
cotton  Lords.  He  concludes  a  letter,  addressed  to  Mr. Cobden,  with  the 
following  epigrammatic  characterization  of  the  West-Riding  oracle: 

20 

25 

"Elated  and  unbalanced  by  one  single  triumph,  he  would  compass  a 
popular  autocracy.  The  prophet  of  a  clique,  restlessly  agitating,  greedy  of 
notoriety,  chafed  of  opposition,  crotchety,  illogical,  Utopian,  stubborn  of 
purpose,  arrogant of bearing, a quarrelsome peace-preacher and acrimonious 
proselyte  of universal brotherhood, with liberty upon his lips, but despotism 
in his dogmas, he is exasperated with a press that will neither be bullied nor 
bamboozled—would  geld  its  influence,  intelligence,  and  independence,  and 
would  sink  a  profession  of  accomplished  gentlemen, 
to  a  gang  of 
penny-a-liners,  with  himself  for  the  only  Leader." 

Karl  Marx.

London,  Friday,  March  18,  1853. 

Parliament will  adjourn to-day,  for  the  Easter recess,  until  April 4th. 

In  a  former  letter  I  reported,  according  to  a  generally  accredited  rumor, 
that  Libeny's  wife  had been flogged by the  Austrians  at Pesth.  I have  since 
ascertained  that  he was never married,  and likewise that the  story circulated 
in  the  English press,  saying that he had attempted to revenge his father, who 
had  been  ill-treated  by  the  Austrians,  is  wholly  unfounded.  He  acted  ex 
clusively  under  the  influence  of  political  motives,  and  retained  to  the  last 
hour  a firm  and  heroic  demeanor. 

5 

10 

You  will,  ere  this,  have  received  with  the  English  papers  the  reply  of 
Kossuth  to  Mazzini's declaration.  For my part, I am of opinion that Kossuth 
has  only  made  a bad case  still worse.  The  contradictions  in his first  and  his 
last  declaration  are  so  palpable  that  I  need  not  insist  on  urging  them  here. 
Besides,  there  is  a  repulsive  heterogeneousness  in  the  language  of the two  15 
documents,  the  former  being  written  in  the  Oriental  hyperbolics  of  the 
Prophet,  and  the  latter  in  the  casuistic  pleading-style  of  a  lawyer. 

Mazzini's friends affirm  now, to  a man, that the Milanese insurrection was 
forced  upon  him  and  his  associates  by  circumstances  which  it was  beyond 
his  power  to  control.  But,  on  one  side,  it  belongs  to  the  very  nature  of  20 
conspiracies  to  be  driven  to  a  premature  outbreak,  either  by  treason or by 
accidents.  On  the  other  side,  if  you  cry,  during  three  years,  action,  action, 
action—if your entire revolutionary vocabulary be exhausted by the one word 
"Insurrection,"  you  cannot  expect  to  hold  sufficient authority for dictating, 
at  any  given  moment:  there  shall  be  no  insurrection.  Be  this  as  it  may,  25 
Austrian  brutality  has  turned  the  Milanese  failure  into  the  real  com 
mencement  of  a  national  revolution.  Hear,  for  instance,  the  well-informed 
organ  of  Lord  Palmerston,  The  Morning Post,  of  to-day: 

"The  people  of  Naples  wait  for  a  movement  which  is  sure  to  take place 
in  the  Austrian  Empire.  Then,  the  whole  of  Italy,  from  the  frontiers  of  30 

62 

Kossuth  and  Mazzini—Prussian  Police—Austro-Prussian  Commercial  Treaty—The  Refugees 

Piedmont to Sicily, will be in revolt, and sad disasters will follow. The Italian 
troops  will  disband—the  so-called  Swiss  soldiers  recruited from the  revolu 
tion  of  1848,  will  not  save  the  sovereigns  of  Italy.  An  impossible  republic 
awaits  Italy.  That  will  assuredly  be  the  next  act  of  the  drama which began 
in  1848.  Diplomacy  has  exhausted  all  its  power for the princes of Italy." 

Aurelio  Saffi,  who  countersigned  Mazzini's  proclamation,  and  who  made 
a  tour  through Italy before  the outbreak,  avows, in a letter addressed to  The 
Daily  News,  that  "the  upper  classes  were  sunk  in  listless  indifference  or 
despair,"  and  that  it  was  the  "people  of  Milan,"  the  proletarians,  who, 
"abandoned  without  direction  to  their  own instincts,  preserved their  faith 
in  the  destiny  of  their  country,  in  the  face  of  the  despotism  of  Austrian 
Proconsuls  and  the  judicial  assassinations  of military commissions, and had 
unanimously  made  ready  for  vengeance."

Now,  it is  a great progress  of  the  Mazzini party  to  have  at last convinced 
themselves  that,  even  in  the  case  of  national  insurrections  against foreign 
despotism,  there  exists  such  a  thing  as  class-distinctions,  and  that  it  is  not 
the  upper  classes  which  must  be  looked  to  for  a  revolutionary  movement 
in modern times.  Perhaps  they will  go  a  step  further  and come to the under 
standing  that  they  have  to  seriously  occupy  themselves  with  the  material 
20  condition  of  the  Italian country population,  if  they expect  to  find  an echo 
to their  "Dio  e popolo.  " On a future occasion I intend to dwell on the material 
circumstances  in  which by far  the  greater  portion of the rural inhabitants of 
that  country  are  placed,  and  which  have  made  them  till  now,  if  not  re 
actionary,  at  least  indifferent  to  the  national  struggle  of  Italy.

Two  thousand  copies  of  a pamphlet  which  I published  some  time ago  at 
Basle,  entitled  "Revelations  on  the  Trial  of  the  Communists  at  Cologne," 
(Enthüllungen  über  den  Cölner  Communisten-Prozess)  have  been  seized  at 
the  Baden  frontier  and burned,  on  the  request  of the  Prussian Government. 
According  to  the  new  Press  Law  imposed  on  the  Swiss  Bund  by  the  Con-
tinental  Powers,  the  publisher,  Mr. Schabelitz,  his  son,  and the printer will 
be  persecuted  by  the  Basle  Government,  which  has  already  confiscated  a 
number  of  copies  still  in  possession  of  the  publisher.  This  will be  the  first 
trial  of  this  kind  in  Switzerland,  and  the  affair  has  become  already  a matter 
of  controversy  between  the  Radicals  and  the  Conservative  party.  How 
35  anxious  the  Prussian  Government  is  to  conceal  its  infamies  during  the 
Cologne  trial  from  publicity,  you  may  infer  from  the  fact that the  Minister 
of  the  Exterior  has  issued  orders  for  the  seizure  (Fahndebriefe)  of  the 
pamphlet  wherever  it  should appear,  but does  not even dare  to  call it by  its 
title.  In  order  to  mislead  the  public,  he  gives  as  its  name  "A  Theory  of 
40  Communism,  '  '  while  it  contains  nothing  but  revelations  of  the  Prussian  state 

mysteries.

The  only  "progress"  made  in official Germany  since  the  year  1848,  is the 
conclusion  of  the  Austro-Prussian  Commercial  Treaty—et  encore!  That 
Treaty  is  surrounded  with  so  many  clausulae,  retrenched  behind  so  many 
exceptions,  and  reserves  so  many  chief  questions  to  the  future  adjustment 
of  yet  unborn  commissions,  while  the  actual  diminution  in  the  tariffs  is  so 
small,  that it amounts  to  a mere aspiration towards a real Commercial Union 
of  Germany,  and  is,  practically  speaking,  utterly  insignificant.  The  most 
striking  feature  of  the  Treaty  is  the  victory  Austria  has  again  won  over 
Prussia.  This  perfidious,  this  base,  this  cowardly,  this  vacillating  sham-
power,  has  bowed  again  before  its  more  brutal,  but  more  straightforward  10 
rival.  Not  only  has  Austria  forced  a  treaty  on  Prussia  which the  latter was 
most unwilling  to  accept,  but  Prussia  has  been  compelled  to  renew the  old 
Zoll-Verein with the  old  tariff,  or  to promise  not to change, for twelve  years, 
anything  in  her  Commercial  policy  without  the  unanimous  consent  of  the 
minor  Zoll-Verein States i.e., without the permission of Austria (the  South-  15 
German  States  being  not  only  politically,  but also commercially, the vassals 
of  Austria,  or  the  antagonists  of  Prussia.)  Since  the  restoration  of  "Divine 
Power,"  Prussia has  marched from degradation to degradation.  Her king,  "a 
wise man in his times," appears to think that his people may derive a comfort 
ing  compensation  in  the  infernal  despotism  they  are  subject  to  from  the  20 
debasement  their  Government  has  to  suffer  abroad. 

The  refugee-question  is  not  settled  yet.  The  semi-official  Oesterreichische 
Correspondenz contradicts  the  statement,  that Austria had  addressed  at this 
moment  a  fresh  note  to  the  English  Government,  because  "recent  events 
having shown that Lord Palmer ston has recovered his influence, the Imperial 25 
Government could not expose  its  dignity  to  a certain check." I have written 
you before on Palmerston's declaration in the  House of Commons. From the 
English  papers  you  know  the  philo-Austrian  declaration of  Aberdeen  in the 
House of Lords, that the English Government would make itself the  spy and 
Attorney-General  of  Austria.  Palmerston's  journal  now  remarks  on  the  30 
observation  of  his  colleague: 

"Even on the  modified  concession which Lord Aberdeen appears inclined 
to  make, we cannot  say that we look with much confidence to success.... No 
one  will  dare  to  propose  to  a  British Government to  attempt its  conversion 
into  an  engine  of  foreign  police  and  a political  man-trap." 

35 

You  see  what  good  understanding  there  is  in  the  councils  of  the  Methu 
salem  ministry  between  "antiquated  imbecility  and  liberal  energy."  In  the 
whole  London  press  there  was  a  unanimous  cry  of  indignation  against 
Aberdeen  and  the  House  of  Lords,  with  one  base  exception,  that  of  The 
Times newspaper. 

40 

The  Times,  you  will  remember,  commenced  by  denouncing the refugees 

j 

64 

Kossuth  and  Mazzini—Prussian  Police—Austro-Prussian  Commercial  Treaty—The  Refugees 

and  inviting  the  Foreign  Powers  to  ask  for  their  expulsion.  Then,  having 
ascertained  that  a  renewal  of  the  Alien  Bill  would be  refused  with  scorn  to 
the  Ministry  in the  House  of  Commons,  it  at once  overflowed  with rhetori 
cally framed  descriptions  of  the  sacrifice it was ready to  make—oh dear!—for 
the  preservation  of  the  right  of  asylum.  Finally,  after  the  amiable  con 
versation  between  my  Lords  of  the  Upper  House,  it  revenged  itself  on  its 
own high-sounding civism,  with  the  following  angry  explosion in  its leading 
article  of  March  5th: 

5 

"It is believed in many parts of the Continent that we delight in this country 
10  of  a  menagerie  of  refugees—ferocious  characters  of  all  nations,  and  fit  for 

all  crimes  . ..  Do  these  foreign  writers  who  denounce  the presence  of theñ-
own  outlawed countrymen  in  England,  suppose  that the existence of a refu 
gee  in  this  country  is  an  enviable  fate?  Let  them  be  undeceived.  This 
wretched  class  of  beings  live,  for  the  most  part,  in  squalid  poverty,  eating 
the  salt of  the  stranger,  when  they  can  get  it,  sunk,  as  it were, beneath the 
turbid  waves  of  this  vast  metropolis  . ..  Their  punishment  is  exile  in  its 
harshest 

form." 

As  to  the  last  point,  The  Times  is  right;  England  is  a  delightful  country 

15 

to  live  out  of. 

20 

In  the  "heaven  of Mars"  Dante  meets  with  his  ancestor,  Cacciaguida di 
Elisei,  who  predicts  to  him  his  approaching  exile  from  Florence  in  these 
words: 

25 

"Tu  proverai  si  come  sa  di  sale 
Lo  pane  altrui,  e  com'è  duro  calle 
Lo  scendere  e  il  salir  per  l'altrui  scale." 

"Thou  shalt prove  how  salt  the  savour  is 
Of  others  bread,  how  hard  the  passage, 
To  descend  and  climb  by  others'  stairs." 

Happy Dante,  another  "being of  that wretched  class  called  political refu-
30  gees,"  whom  his  enemies  could  not  threaten  with  the  misery  of  a  rimes-
leader!  Happier  "Γ/mes,"that  escaped  a  "reserved  seat"  in  his  "Inferno!" 
If  the  refugees  eat the  salt  of the  stranger,  as  The  Times  says,  getting  it 
at strange prices,  too, which it forgot to  say,  is  The  Times itself not feeding 
on  the  strangers' flesh and blood? How many leaders  and how many pounds 
35  have  its  anonymous  Pythias  not  made  out  of  French  revolutions,  German 
insurrections, Italian outbreaks  and Hungarian wars,  of French "fusillades," 
of  Austrian gallows, of confiscated heads  and beheaded property? Unhappy 
Times,  if  there  were  no  "ferocious  characters"  on the  Continent,  if it were 
to  grow  older  day by  day  on  the  coarse  food  of  Smithfield  Market,  London 
40  chimney  smoke,  dirt,  ferocious  cabmen,  the  six  bridges  of  the  Thames, 

65 

Karl  Marx 

intermural  interments, pestilential  church  yards,  filthy  drink-water,  railway 
accidents, crippled pint and quart bottles, and other interesting topics, which 
form  its  regular  stock-in-trade,  in the  intervals  of  continental dullness.  The 
Times  is  unchanged  since  the epoch when it called upon the British Govern 
ment  to  murder  Napoleon  I.  "Is  it  considered,"  it  said,  in  its  number  of 
July  27,  1815,  "what  effect  the  knowledge  of  his  being  in  existence  must 
necessarily have on the  disaffected  in every part of Europe? They will think, 
and  think  with  truth,  that  the  allied  sovereigns  are  afraid to  touch  the  life 
of a man who has so many adherents and admirers." It is  still the  same paper 
which  preached  the  crusade  against the  United  States  of America: 

"No  peace  should  be  made  with  America,  until  that mischievous  example 

of  successful  democratic  rebellion  has  been  done  away." 

In  The  Times editorial office there  are  no  "ferocious"  continental  charac 
ters.  Quite the contrary.  There is,  for example, a poor little man, a Prussian, 
named  Otto  von  Wenckstern,  once  editor  of  a  little  German  newspaper, 
afterward  sunk in  Switzerland,  in  squalid poverty,  appealing  to  the  pockets 
of  Freiligrath  and  other  refugees,  and lastly finding himself  at the  same  time 
in  the  service  of  the  Prussian  Ambassador  in  London—the  far-famed  Bun-
sen—and  an integral member of the Printing-House-square oracle. There  are 
more  such conciliatory  continental characters  in  The  Times Office, forming 
the  connecting  link  between  the  Continental  Police  and  the  leading journal 
of  England.

The  liberty  of  the  Press  in England  is  exemplified by the following case: 
At  the  Bow-st.  Police  Office,  in  London,  Mr. E. Truelove,  of  the  Strand, 
appeared  on  an  information  laid  at  the  instance  of  the  Commissioners  of  25 
Inland  Revenue,  under  6th  and  7th  William  IV.,  cap. 76,  for  having  sold  a 
newspaper,  called  The  Potteries  Free  Press,  and  printed  on  paper  not  duly 
stamped.  Four  numbers  of  this  paper  had  been  published  at  Stoke-upon-
Trent,  the  nominal  proprietor  being  Collet  Dobson Collet,  Secretary of  the 
Society  for  the  Abolition  of  Taxes  on  Knowledge,  who  have  issued  it  in 
"Conformity  with  the  practice  of  the  Stamp-Office,  which permits  records 
of  current  events  and  comments  thereon,  to  be  published  without  a  stamp 
in  The Athen&um,  Builder,  Punch,  Racing Times, etc. ;"  and with the  avowed 
intention  of  inviting  a  Government  prosecution,  in  order  that  a  Jury  might 
determine  what  description of  news  is  to be  entitled to  exemption from  the  35 
penny  stamp.  Mr. Henry,  the  magistrate,  has  reserved his  decision.  Much, 
however,  will  not  depend  on  the  decision,  for  the  paper  in  question  is  not 
issued  in  defiance  of  the  Stamp  Law,  but  merely  to  avail  itself  of  a  still 
doubtful  quibble  in  the  law.

The  English  papers  of  to-day  have  a  telegraphic  dispatch  from  Con-  40

of  Foreign  Affairs,  has  been replaced  by Rifaat Pasha.  This  concession has 
been  extorted  from  the  Porte  by  the  Extraordinary  Russian  Envoy,  Prince 
Menchikoff.  The  affair  of the Holy Places is  not settled yet between Russia, 
France,  and  the  Porte,  as  L. Napoleon,  highly  irritated  at  the  intrigues  of 
Russia  and  Austria for the prevention of his coronation by the Pope, intends

British Politics—Disraeli—The Refugees— 
Mazzini in London—Turkey. 

Correspondence  of  The  N.Y.Tribune. 

London,  Tuesday,  March 22,  1853. 

The  most  important  event  in  the  cotemporaneous  history  of parties  is Dis- 
raëli's  deposition from the  leadership  of  the "great Conservative"  minority. 
Disraeli,  it  has  transpired,  was  himself  prepared  to  throw  overboard  his 
former  allies  eight or nine weeks before the  dissolution of the Tory Cabinet, 
and  desisted  from  bis  resolution only  at the  urgent  instance  of  Lord  Derby. 
He  in his  turn,  is  now  dismissed and has been formally replaced by Sir John 
Pakington,  a  safe  character,  cautious,  not  altogether  wanting  in  ad 
ministrative  ability,  but  a  mournful  man  otherwise,  the very incarnation of 
the  worn-out  prejudices  and  antiquated  feelings  of  the  old  English  squireo-
cracy.  This  change  in leadership  amounts  to  a complete,  and perhaps  to the 
final  transformation  of  the Tory party. Disraeli may congratulate himself on 
his  emancipation from  the  landed humbugs.  Whatever be our opinion of the 
man,  who  is  said  to  despise  the  aristocracy,  to  hate the  bourgeoisie,  and not 
to  like  the  people;  he  is  unquestionably  the  ablest  member  of  the  present 
Parliament,  while  the  flexibility  of  bis  character  enables  him  the  better  to 
accommodate himself  to  the  changing wants  of  society.

In reference  to  the  Refugee  question  I  told  you in my last, that after Lord 
Palmerston's  speech  in  the  House  of  Commons,  the  Austrian  journals  de 
clared it to be  useless  to  ask for redress from  a Cabinet corrupted by Palmer-
stonian influence.  But  scarcely was Aberdeen's  declaration in the House of 
Lords  telegraphed  to  Vienna when the  aspect of things changed again.  The  25 
same  journals  now  assert  that  "Austria  trusts  to  the  honor  of  the  English 
Cabinet,"  and  the  semi-official  Oesterreichische  Correspondenz  publishes 
the  following  from  its  Paris  Correspondent:

"Lord Cowley, on his return to Paris,  stated to the Emperor of the French, 
that  the  diplomatic  representatives  of  England  at  the  Northern  Courts  had 
been  formally  instructed  to  employ  all  their  efforts  to  deter  the  Northern 
Powers  from  forwarding  a  collective  note  to  the  British  Government,  and 
to  urge,  as  the  ground  for  such  abstention, that that Government would be 
the  better  enabled  to  comply  with  the  demand  of those  powers,  the  more  it 
could  keep  up,  in  all  eyes  of  England,  the  appearance  of  acting freely and 
voluntarily  in 

the  matter... 

The  British Ambassador,  Lord  Cowley,  urged  the  Emperor of the  French 
to  place  implicit  confidence  on  the  British  Cabinet,  the  more  so  as  the 
Emperor  would  always  be  at  liberty  to  take  any  steps  he  might  consider 
proper  in  the  event  of  that  confidence  not  having  been  justified  . ..  The 
Emperor  of the  French, while reserving to  himself full freedom of  action for 
the  future,  was  induced  to put  the  sincerity of the British  Cabinet  to  the proof, 

15  and  he is  now endeavoring to persuade the other powers to follow his exam 

ple." 

You see what is expected from "ce cher Aberdeen, "as Louis Philippe used 
to  call  him,  and  what  promises  he  must  have  made.  These  promises  are 
actually  already  followed  up  by  deeds.  Last  week  the  English Police  drew 
20  up a list of the Continental refugees residing in London. Several detectives, 
in plain clothes, walked from square to square, from street to street, and from 
house  to  house,  making  notes  on  the  personals  of the  refugees,  addressing 
themselves  in  the  majority  of  cases  to  the  publicans  in  the  neighborhood, 
but entering in some instances, under the pretense of the pursuit of criminals, 
the  very  domiciles  and  searching  the papers  of  some  exiles. 

25 

While  the  Continental  Police  is  vainly  hunting  after  Mazzini,  while  at 
Nuremberg  the  magistrates  have  ordered  the  closure  of  the  gates  in  order 
to  catch  him—no  man  being  hanged  there  before  he  is  caught,  according to 
the  old  German  proverb—while  the  English  press  publishes  reports  after 
reports  as  to  his  supposed  sojourn, Mazzini has for the past few  days been 
safe  and  sound  at  London. 

30 

Prince  Menchikoff,  after  reviewing  the  Russian  forces  stationed  in  the 
Danubian  principalities,  and  after  an  inspection  of  the  army  and  fleet  at 
Sebastopol,  where  he  caused  manœuvres  of  embarking  and  disembarking 
35 troops to be executed under his own eyes, entered Constantinople in the most 
theatrical  style  on  Feb. 28,  attended  by  a  suite  of  12 persons, including the 
Admiral  of  the  Russian  squadron  in  the  Black  Sea,  a  General  of  Division, 
and  several  staff  officers,  with  M.  de  Nesselrode,  Jr.,  as  Secretary  of  the 
Embassy.  He  met  with  such  a  reception  from  the  Greek  and  Russian  in-
40  habitants  as he were the orthodox Czar himself entering  Tsarigradto restore 
it  to  the  true  faith.  An  enormous  sensation  was  created  here  and  at  Paris, 

69 

Karl  Marx/Friedrich  Engels 

by  the  news  that Prince  Menchikoff,  not  satisfied with the  dismissal of  Fuad 
Effendi,  had  demanded  that  the  Sultan  should  abandon  to  the  Emperor  of 
Russia,  not  only  the  protection  of  all  the  Christians  in Turkey,  but also  the 
right  of  nominating  the  Greek  patriarch;  that the  Sultan had appealed to the 
protection  of  England  and  France  ;  that  Colonel  Rose,  the  British  Envoy,  had  5 
dispatched  the  steamer  Wasp  in  haste  to  Malta  to  request  the  immediate 
presence  of  the  English  fleet  in  the  Archipelago,  and  that Russian  vessels 
had  anchored  at  Kili,  near  the  Dardanelles.  The  Paris  Moniteur informs  us 
that the  French squadron at Toulon had been ordered to the Grecian waters. 
Admiral Dundas,  however,  is  still  at Malta.  From all this, it is evident, that  10 
the  Eastern  Question  is  once  more  on  the  European  "ordre  du jour, "a  fact 
not  astonishing  for  those  who  are  acquainted  with  history. 

Whenever  the  revolutionary  hurricane  has  subsided  for  a  moment,  one 
ever-recurring  question  is  sure  to  turn  up:  the  eternal  "Eastern  Question. " 
Thus,  when  the  storms  of  the  first  French  revolution  had  passed,  and  15 
Napoleon  and  Alexander of Russia had divided, after the peace of Tilsit, the 
whole  of Continental Europe betwixt themselves, Alexander profited by the 
momentary  calm  to  march  an  army  into  Turkey,  and  to  "give  a lift"  to the 
forces  that  were  breaking  up  from  within  that  decaying  empire.  Again,  no 
sooner  had  the  revolutionary  movements  of  Western  Europe  been quelled  20 
by  the  Congresses  of  Laibach  and  Verona,  than  Alexander's  successor, 
Nicholas,  made  another  dash  at Turkey. When a few years later, the revolu 
tion of July, with its concomitant insurrections in Poland, Italy, Belgium, had 
had  its  turn,  and  Europe,  as  remodeled in  1831,  seemed out of the reach of 
domestic  squalls,  the  Eastern  question,  in  1840,  appeared  on  the  point of  25 
embroiling  the  "great  Powers"  in  a  general war.  And now,  when the  short 
sightedness  of  the  ruling  pigmies  prides  itself  in  having  successfully  freed 
Europe  from  the  dangers  of  anarchy  and  revolution,  up  starts  again  the 
everlasting  topic,  the  never-failing  difficulty:  What  shall  we  do  with  Tur 
key? 

30 

Turkey  is  the  living  sore  of European legitimacy. The impotency of legiti 
mate,  monarchical government,  ever  since  the first French Revolution,  has 
resumed  itself  in  the  one  axiom:  Keep  up  the  status  quo.  A  testimonium 
paupertatis,  an  acknowledgment of the  universal incompetence  of the  ruling 
powers, for any purpose of progress or civilization, is  seen in this universal  35 
agreement  to  stick  to  things  as  by  chance  or  accident  they  happen  to  be. 
Napoleon could  dispose of a whole continent at a moment's notice; aye, and 
dispose  of  it,  too,  in  a  manner  that  showed  both  genius  and  fixedness  of 
purpose;  the  entire  "collective wisdom" of European legitimacy, assembled 
in  Congress  at  Vienna,  took  a  couple  of  years  to  do  the  same  job,  got  at  40 
loggerheads  over  it,  made  a  very  sad  mess,  indeed,  of it,  and found  it  such 

70 

British  Politics-Disraeli—The  Refugees—Mazzini  in  London—Turkey 

a  dreadful  bore  that  ever  since  they  have  had  enough  of it,  and have  never 
tried  their  hands  again  at  parceling out  Europe.  Myrmidons  of mediocrity, 
as  Béranger  calls  them,  without  historical  knowledge  or  insight  into  facts, 
without  ideas,  without initiative,  they  adore  the  status  quo they themselves 
5  have  bungled  together,  knowing  what  a  bungling  and  blundering  piece  of 

workmanship  it  is.

But  Turkey  no  more  than  the  rest  of  the  world  remains  stationary;  and 
just  when  the  reactionary  party  has  succeeded  in  restoring  in  civilized 
Europe  what  they  consider  to  be  the  status  quo  ante,  it is  perceived  that  in 
the  meantime the  status quo in Turkey has been very much altered, that new 
questions,  new  relations,  new  interests  have  sprung up,  and  that  the  poor 
diplomatists  have  to  begin  again  where  they  were  interrupted  by  a general 
earthquake  some  eight or ten years before. Keep up the status quo in Turkey! 
Why,  you  might  as  well  try  to  keep  up  the  precise  degree  of  putridity into 
15  which  the  carcass  of  a  dead  horse  has  passed  at  a given time,  before  dis 
solution  is  complete.  Turkey  goes  on  decaying,  and  will  go  on decaying  as 
long  as  the  present  system  of  "balance  of  power"  and  maintenance  of  the 
"status  quo"  goes  on,  and in  spite  of  Congresses, protocols  and ultimatums 
it  will  produce  its  yearly  quota  of  diplomatic  difficulties  and  international 
squabbles quite as every other putrid body will supply the neighborhood with 
a  due  allowance  of  carburetted  hydrogen  and  other  well-scented  gaseous 
matter.

Let  us  look  at  the  question  at  once.  Turkey  consists  of  three  entirely 
distinct  portions:  the  vassal  principalities  of  Africa,  viz.  Egypt  and  Tunis; 
25  Asiatic  Turkey,  and  European Turkey.  The  African possessions,  of  which 
Egypt  alone  may  be  considered  as  really  subject to  the  Sultan,  may be  left 
for  the  moment  out  of  the  question; Egypt belongs more to the English than 
to anybody else, and will and must necessarily form their share in any future 
partition of Turkey.  Asiatic Turkey is the real seat of whatever strength there 
is in the  Empire;  Asia Minor and Armenia, for four hundred years the chief 
abode of the Turks, form  the reserved ground from which the Turkish armies 
have been drawn, from those that threatened the ramparts of Vienna, to those 
that  dispersed  before  Diebitsch's  not very  skillful  manœuvers  at Kulewsha. 
Turkey  in  Asia,  although  thinly  populated,  yet  forms  too  compact  a  mass 
35  of  Mussulman  fanaticism  and  Turkish  nationality  to  invite  at present  any 
attempts  at  conquest;  and  in  fact  whenever  the  "Eastern  Question"  is 
mooted,  the  only  portions  of  this  territory  taken  into  consideration,  are 
Palestine  and  the  Christian  valleys  of  the  Lebanon. 

40 

The  real  point  at  issue  always  is,  Turkey  in  Europe—the  great  peninsula 
to  the  south  of  the  Save  and  Danube.  This  splendid  territory  has  the  mis 
fortune  to  be inhabited by a conglomerate of different races and nationalities, 

71 

Karl  Marx/Friedrich  Engels 

of  which  it is hard to  say  which is  the  least fit for progress  and civilization. 
Slavonians,  Greeks,  Wallachians,  Arnauts,  twelve  millions  of  men,  are  all 
held  in  submission  by  one  million  of  Turks,  and  up  to  a  recent  period  it 
appeared  doubtful  whether,  of  all  these  different races,  the  Turks  were  not 
the most competent to hold the supremacy which, in such a mixed population, 5 
could  not  but  accrue  to  one  of  these  nationalities.  But  when  we  see  how 
lamentably  have  failed  all the  attempts  at civilization by Turkish authority-
how  the  fanaticism  of  Islam,  supported  principally  by  the  Turkish  mob  in 
a  few  great  cities,  has  availed  itself  of the  assistance  of  Austria  and  Russia 
invariably to regain power and to overturn any progress that might have been  10 
made;  when  we  see  the  central,  i.e.  Turkish authority  weakened year  after 
year  by  insurrections  in  the  Christian  provinces,  none  of  which,  thanks  to 
the  weakness  of  the  Porte  and  to  the  intervention of neighboring States,  is 
ever  completely  fruitless;  when  we  see  Greece  acquire  her  independence, 
parts  of  Armenia  conquered  by  Russia—Moldavia,  Wallachia,  Serbia,  sue-  15 
cessively  placed  under  the  protectorate  of  the  latter  power,—we  shall  be 
obliged  to  admit  that the  presence  of the Turks  in Europe  is  a real obstacle 
to  the  development  of  the  resources  of  the  Thraco-Illyrian  Peninsula. 

We  can  hardly  describe  the  Turks  as  the  ruling class of  Turkey,  because 
the  relations  of  the  different classes  of  society there  are  as  much mixed up  20 
as those of the various races. The Turk is, according to localities and circum 
stances,  workman,  farmer,  small  freeholder,  trader,  feudal  landlord  in  the 
lowest  and  most barbaric  stage  of feudalism,  civil  officer,  or  soldier;  but  in 
all  these  different  social  positions  he  belongs  to  the  privileged  creed  and 
nation—he  alone  has  the  right to  carry  arms,  and  the  highest  Christian  has  25 
to  give  up  the  footpath  to  the  lowest  Moslem  he  meets.  In  Bosnia  and  the 
Herzegovina,  the  nobility,  of  Slavonian  descent,  has  passed  over to  Islam, 
while the mass of the people remain Rayahs, i.e. Christians.  In this province, 
then,  the  ruling  creed  and  the  ruling  class  are  identified,  as  of  course  the 
Moslem Bosnian is upon a level with his co-religionist of Turkish descent. 

30 

The  principal  power  of  the  Turkish population in Europe,  independently 
of  the  reserve  always  ready  to  be  drawn  from  Asia,  lies  in  the  mob  of 
Constantinople  and  a  few  other  large  towns.  It  is  essentially  Turkish,  and 
though it finds its principal livelihood by doing jobs for Christian capitalists, 
it maintains with great jealousy the  imaginary  superiority  and real impunity  35 
for  excesses  which the  privileges  of  Islam  confer upon it  as  compared with 
Christians.  It  is  well  known that this mob in every important  coup d'état has 
to be won over by bribes and flattery. It is this mob alone, with the exception 
of  a  few  colonized  districts,  which  offers  a compact  and  imposing mass  of 
Turkish population  in  Europe.  And  certainly there  will be,  sooner or later,  40 
an absolute  necessity of freeing one  of  the finest parts  of this  continent from 

72 

British  Politics—Disraeli—The  Refugees—Mazzini  in  London—Turkey 

the  rule  of  a  mob,  compared  to  which  the  mob  of  Imperial  Rome  was  an 
assemblage  of  sages  and  heroes. 

5 

Among the  other  nationalities,  we  may dispose in a very few words  of the 
Arnauts,  a hardy  aboriginal  mountain people, inhabiting the country sloping 
toward  the  Adriatic,  speaking  a  language  of  their  own,  which,  however, 
appears  to  belong  to  the great Indo-European  stock.  They are partly Greek 
Christians,  partly  Moslems,  and,  according  to  all  we  know  of  them,  as  yet 
very unprepared for civilization.  Their predatory habits  will force any neigh 
boring  government  to  hold  them  in  close military  subjection, until industrial 
10  progress  in the  surrounding districts  shall find them employment as hewers 
of  wood  and  drawers  of  water,  the  same  as  has  been  the  case  with  the 
Gallegos  in  Spain,  and the inhabitants  of  mountainous  districts generally. 

The  Wallachians  or  Daco-Romans,  the  chief  inhabitants  of  the  district 
between the Lower Danube and the Dniester, are a greatly mixed population, 
15  belonging  to  the  Greek  Church  and  speaking  a language  derived  from  the 
Latin,  and  in  many  respects  not  unlike  the  Italian.  Those  of  Transylvania 
and the Bukowina belong to the Austrian, those of Bessarabia to the Russian 
Empire;  those  of  Moldavia and  Wallachia, the two only principalities where 
the Daco-Roman race has acquired a political existence, have Princes of their 
20  own,  under  the  nominal  suzeraineté of  the  Porte  and  the  real  dominion  of 
Russia.  Of the Transylvanian Wallachians we heard much during the Hungar 
ian  War;  hitherto  oppressed  by  the  feudalism  of  Hungarian  landlords  who 
were,  according  to  the  Austrian  system,  made  at  the  same  time  the  in 
struments  of  all  Government  exactions,  this  brutalized  mass  was  in  like 
25  manner  as  the  Ruthenian  serfs  of  Galicia  in  1846,  won  over  by  Austrian 
promises  and  bribes,  and  began  that  war  of  devastation  which  has  made  a 
desert of Transylvania.  The Daco-Romans  of the Turkish Principalities have 
at least a native nobility and political institutions ; and in spite of all the efforts 
of  Russia,  the  revolutionary  spirit  has  penetrated  among  them,  as  the  in-
30 surrection of 1848 well proved. There can hardly b ea doubt that the exactions 
and  hardships  inflicted  upon them  during the Russian occupation  since  1848 
must  have  raised  this  spirit  still  higher,  in  spite  of  the  bond  of  common 
religion  and  Czaro-Popish  superstition  which  has  hitherto  led  them  to  look 
upon  the  imperial  chief of the Greek Church as upon their natural protector. 
35  And if this is  the  case, the Wallachian nationality may yet play an important 

part  in  the  ultimate  disposal  of  the  territories  in  question. 

The  Greeks  of  Turkey  are  mostly of  Slavonic  descent,  but have  adopted 
the  modern  Hellenic  language;  in  fact,  with  the  exception  of  a  few  noble 
families  of  Constantinople  and  Trapezunt,  it is  now  generally  admitted  that 
40  very  little  pure  Hellenic  blood  is  to  be  found  even  in  Greece.  The Greeks, 
along with the Jews, are the principal traders in the seaports and many inland 

73 

Karl  Marx/Friedrich  Engels 

towns. They are also tillers of the  sou in some  districts.  In all cases, neither 
their numbers, compactness, nor spirit of nationality, give them any political 
weight  as  a  nation,  except  in  Thessaly  and  perhaps  Epirus.  The  influence 
held  by  a  few  noble  Greek  families  as  dragomans  (interpreters)  in  Con 
stantinople,  is fast declining,  since Turks have been educated in Europe and 
European legations  have been provided with attachés who  speak Turkish. 

5 

15 

We  now  come  to  the  race  that forms  the great mass of the population and 
whose  blood  is  preponderant wherever  a mixture  of races  has  occurred.  In 
fact  it  may  be  said  to  form  the  principal  stock  of  the  Christian  population 
from  the  Morea  to  the  Danube,  and  from  the  Black  Sea  to  the  Arnaut  10 
Mountains.  This  race  is the Slavonic race, and more particularly that branch 
of it which is resumed under the name of Ulyrian (Ilirski,) or South Slavonian 
(Jugoslavenski.)  After  the  Western  Slavonian  (Polish  and  Bohemian,)  and 
Eastern  Slavonian  (Russian,)  it  forms  the  third  branch  of  that  numerous 
Slavonic  family  which  for  the  last  twelve  hundred  years  has  occupied  the 
East of  Europe.  These  southern Slavonians occupy not only the greater part 
of  Turkey,  but  also  Dalmatia,  Croatia,  Slavonia  and the  south of Hungary. 
They  all  speak  the  same  language,  which  is  much  akin  to  the  Russian,  and 
by  far  to western  ears, the  most musical of  all  Slavonic tongues.  The  Croa-
tians  and  part  of  the  Dalmatians  are  Roman  Catholics,  all  the  remainder  20 
belong  to  the  Greek  Church.  The  Roman  Catholics  use the  Latin alphabet, 
but  the  followers  of  the  Greek  Church  write  their  language  in  the  Cyrillic 
character,  which  is  also  used  in  the  Russian  and  old  Slavonic  or  Church 
language.  This  circumstance  connected  with  the  difference of religion,  has 
contributed  to  retard  any national development embracing the  whole  south  25 
Slavonic territory.  A man in Belgrade may not be able to read a book printed 
in  his  own  language  at  Agram  or  Betch,  he  may  object  even  to  take  it up, 
on account of the  "heterodox"  alphabet and orthography used therein; while 
he  will  have  little  difficulty  in  reading  and understanding  a book printed  at 
Moscow,  in  the  Russian  language,  because  the  two  idioms,  particularly in  30 
the  old  Slavonic  etymological  system  of orthography, look very much alike, 
and  because  the  book  is  printed  in  the  "orthodox"  (pravoslavni)  alphabet. 
The  mass  of  the  Greek  Slavonians  will  not even have their bibles,  liturgies 
and  prayer books  printed  in their  own country,  because  they  are  convinced 
that there is a peculiar correctness and orthodoxy and odor of sanctity about  35 
anything  printed  in  holy  Moscow  or  in  the  imperial  printing  establishment 
of St. Petersburg.  In spite of all the panslavistic efforts of Agram and Prague 
enthusiasts,  the  Serbian,  the  Bulgarian,  the  Bosnian  Rayah,  the  Slavonian 
peasant of Macedonia and Thracia, has more national sympathy, more points 
of contact, more means of intellectual intercourse with the Russian than with 40 
the Roman Catholic  south  Slavonian who  speaks the  same language.  What-

74 

British  Politics—Disraeli—The  Refugees—Mazzini  in  London—Turkey 

ever  may  happen,  he  looks  to  St. Petersburg for  the  advent of the  Messiah 
who is to deliver him from all evil; and if he calls Constantinople his  Tsarigrad 
or  Imperial  City,  it  is  as  much  in  anticipation  of the  orthodox Tsar coming 
from  the  north  and  entering it to  restore  the true faith,  as in recollection of 
the  orthodox  Tsar  who  held  it  before  the  Turks  overran  the  country. 

5 

Subjected  in the  greater  part of  Turkey to  the  direct rule  of  the  Turk, but 
under  local  authorities  of  their  own  choice, partly  (in Bosnia) converted to 
the faith of the conqueror, the Slavonian race has, in that country, maintained 
or conquered political existence in two localities. The one is Serbia, the valley 
10  of the Morava,  a province with well defined natural lines  of frontier, which 
played  an  important  part  in  the  history  of  these  regions  six  hundred  years 
ago.  Subdued  for  a  while  by  the  Turks,  the  Russian war  of  1806  gave  it  a 
chance  of  obtaining  a  separate  existence,  though  under  the  Turkish  su 
premacy.  It  has  remained  ever  since  under  the  immediate  protection  of 
15  Russia.  But,  as  in  Moldavia  and  Wallachia,  political  existence  has  brought 
on new wants,  and forced upon Serbia an increased intercourse with Western 
Europe.  Civilization  began  to  take  root,  trade  extended,  new  ideas  sprang 
up;  and  thus  we find  in  the  very heart  and  stronghold  of  Russian influence, 
in  Slavonic,  orthodox  Serbia, an anti-Russian, progressive party, (of course, 
20  very  modest  in  its  demands  of  reform,)  headed  by  the  ex-Minister  of  Fi 

nances  Garashanin. 

There is no doubt that,  should the Greco-Slavonian population ever obtain 
the  mastery  in  the  land  which  it  inhabits  and  where  it  forms  three-fourths 
of the  whole  population  (seven millions,) the  same necessities would by and 
25  by give birth  to  an  anti-Russian,  progressive  party,  the  existence  of  which 
has  been  hitherto  the  inevitable  consequence  of  any  portion  of  it  having 
become  semi-detached  from  Turkey. 

In Montenegro, we have not afertile valley with comparatively large cities, 
but a barren mountain country of difficult access.  Here  a  set of robbers have 
fixed themselves,  scouring the plains  and  storing the plunder in their moun 
tain fastnesses.  These romantic but rather uncouth gentlemen have long been 
a  nuisance  in  Europe,  and  it is  but in keeping with the  policy of Russia  and 
Austria that they  should  stick up for the rights  of the Black Mountain people 
(Tsernogorci)  to  burn  down  villages,  murder  the  inhabitants  and  carry  off 
the cattle.

Kossuth and General Pierce. 

The  present  "Count"  Pulski  has  arrived  in  Washington,  accompanied  by 
Count Vass,  and Mr. Asbot (formerly  Secretary of Kossuth) as ambassadors 
from  the  latter to  General Pierce,  the  President,  to make disclosures to him, 
relative  to  the  secret  plans  of  Russia  in  Turkey,  and  to  obtain  from Pierce 
a  realisation  of  Kossuth's  expectations.  The  "New  York  Herald,"  a  presi 
dential paper, has  already  stated that M. Pulski had better remained at home. 
The  inaugural  message  of  the  President  shows  how  unfounded  were  the 
expectations.  Another  secret  object  of  the  mission  is  to  win  back  General 
Vetter,  who,  wherever  he  has  been in America,  has  expressed  himself  very 
bitterly  in  relation  to  Kossuth. 

The  Refugees  and  the  London Police.—The  police  have  during  the  last few 
days  been  from  street  to  street  drawing  up  the  Statistics  of the  Refugees— 
principally  their inquiries were made of the neighbouring publicans.  In some 
cases  they  penetrated  into  private  houses  under  false  pretences—and  made 
researches.  The Austrian "Correspondent," the official paper, has  stated that 
the  "good Aberdeen"  had begged the  northern powers  to  save  appearances 
and  not press  publicly  in  relation  to  the fugitives,  as  he  would  then be  able 
to  do  their  will.  Napoleon  has  said,  in reply to  similar representations,  that 
"he  would  give  England  time  to  show  its  good  faith  in  the  matter."

We  are  astonished  that  in  the  current  discussion  of  the  Oriental  Question 
the  English  journals  have  not  more  boldly  demonstrated  the  vital interests 
which  should  render  Great  Britain  the  earnest  and  unyielding  opponent  of 
the  Russian  projects  of  annexation  and  aggrandizement.  England  cannot 
afford  to  allow  Russia  to  become  the  possessor  of  the  Dardanelles  and 
Bosphorus.  Both commercially and politically  such an event would be a deep 
if  not  a  deadly  blow  at British power.  This  will  appear from  a  simple  state 
ment  of  facts  as  to  her  trade  with  Turkey. 

Before the discovery of the  direct route to  India,  Constantinople was  the 
mart  of  an extensive commerce.  And now,  though the products of India find 
their  way  into  Europe  by  the  overland  route  through  Persia,  Turan  and 
Turkey,  yet  the  Turkish  ports  carry  on  a  very  important  and  rapidly  in 
creasing  traffic  both  with  Europe  and  the  interior  of  Asia.  To  understand 
this,  it is  only  necessary  to  look  at the  map.  From  the  Black  Forest to  the 
sandy  hights  of  Novgorod  Veliki,  the  whole  inland  country  is  drained  by 
rivers  flowing  into  the  Black  or  Caspian  Sea.  The  Danube  and  the  Volga, 
the  two  giant-rivers  of  Europe,  the  Dniester,  Dnieper  and  Don,  all form  so 
many  natural channels  for the  carriage  of inland produce  to  the Black Sea— 
for  the  Caspian  itself  is  only  accessible  through the  Black Sea. Two-thirds 
of  Europe—that is,  a part of Germany and Poland, all Hungary, and the  most 
fertile  parts  of Russia, besides Turkey in Europe, are thus naturally referred 
to  the  Euxine  for  the  export  and  exchange  of  their  produce;  and  the  more 
so,  as  all  these  countries  are  essentially  agricultural,  and  the  great  bulk  of 
their  products  must always  make water-carriage the predominant means  of 
transport.  The  corn of  Hungary,  Poland,  Southern Russia, the  wool  and the 
hides  of  the  same  countries  appear  in  yearly  increasing  quantities  in  our 
Western markets, and they all  are  shipped at Galatz, Odessa, Taganrog, and 

77 

Friedrich  Engels 

other  Euxine  ports.  Then  there  is  another  important branch of trade carried 
on  in  the  Black  Sea.  Constantinople,  and particularly Trapezunt,  in Asiatic 
Turkey,  are  the  chief  marts  of  the  caravan  trade  to  the  interior  of Asia,  to 
the  valley of the  Euphrates  and Tigris,  to  Persia,  and Turkestan. This trade, 
too,  is  rapidly  increasing.  The  Greek  and  Armenian  merchants  of  the  two 
towns  just  named  import  large  quantities  of  English  manufactured  goods, 
the  low  price  of  which  is  rapidly  superseding  the  domestic  industry  of  the 
Asiatic  harems.  Trapezunt is  better  situated  for  such a trade  than any other 
point.  It  has  in  its  rear  the  hills  of  Armenia,  which  are  far  less  impassable 
than  the  Syrian  desert,  and  it  lies  at  a  convenient  proximity  to  Bagdad,  10 
Schiraz,  and Teheran,  which latter place  serves  as  an intermediate  mart for 
the  caravans  from  Khiwa  and  Bokhara.  How  important  this  trade,  and the 
Black  Sea  trade  generally  is  becoming,  may  be  seen  at  the  Manchester 
Exchange,  where  dark-complexioned  Greek  buyers  are  increasing  in 
numbers and importance, and where Greek and South-Slavonian dialects are 
heard  along  with  German  and  English. 

5 

15 

The  trade  of  Trapezunt is  also becoming a matter of most serious political 
consideration,  as  it  has  been  the  means  of  bringing  the  interests  of  Russia 
and England  anew  into  conflict in Inner Asia. The Russians had, up to  1840, 
an  almost  exclusive  monopoly  of  the  trade  in  foreign  manufactured  goods  20 
to that region. Russian goods were found to have made their way, and in some 
instances  even  to  be  preferred  to  English  goods,  as  far  down as  the Indus. 
Up  to  the  time  of  the  Affghan war, the conquest of  Scinde and the Punjaub, 
it may be  safely asserted that the trade of England with Inner Asia was nearly 
null.  The  fact  is  now  different.  The  supreme  necessity  of  a never-ceasing  25 
expansion  of  trade—this  fatum  which,  specter-like, haunts  modern England, 
and, if not appeased  at once, brings on those terrible revulsions which vibrate 
from New-York to  Canton,  and from St. Petersburg to Sidney—this inflexible 
necessity  has  caused  the  interior  of  Asia  to  be  attacked  from  two  sides  by 
English trade: from the Indus and from the Black Sea; and although we know 
very  little  of  the  exports  of Russia to  that part of  the world, we  may  safely 
conclude  from  the  increase  of  English  exports  to  that  quarter,  that  the 
Russian trade in that direction must have  sensibly fallen off. The commercial 
battle-field  between  England  and  Russia  has  been removed from  the  Indus 
to  Trapezunt,  and  the  Russian  trade,  formerly  venturing  out  as  far  as  the  35 
limits  of England's  Eastern Empire,  is  now reduced to the  defensive  on the 
very verge of its own line of custom-houses. The importance of this fact with 
regard  to  any future  solution  of  the  Eastern  question,  and  to  the  part which 
both England and Russia may take in it, is evident. They are, and always must 
be,  antagonists  in the  East. 

30 

40 

But  let  us  come  to  a  more  definite  estimate  of  this  Black  Sea  trade. 

78 

The  Real  Issue  in  Turkey 

According  to  The  London  Economist,  the  British  exports  to  the  Turkish 
dominions,  including  Egypt  and  the  Danubian  Principalities,  were: 

5 

In 1840 
In 1842 
In 1844 
In 1846 
In 1848 
In 1850 
In 1851 

£1,440,592 
£2,068,842 
£3,271,333 
£2,707,571 
£3,626,241 
£3,762,480 
£3,548,959 

10 

Of these amounts, at least two-thirds must have gone to ports in the Black 
Sea, including Constantinople.  And all this rapidly increasing trade depends 
upon the  confidence that may be placed in the power which rules the Darda 
nelles  and  the  Bosphorus,  the  keys  to  the  Black  Sea.  Whoever holds these 
can  open  and  shut  at  his  pleasure  the  passage  into  this  last  recess  of  the 
15  Mediterranean.  Let  Russia  once  come  into  possession  of  Constantinople, 
who  will  expect  her  to  keep  open  the  door  by  which  England  has  invaded 
her  commercial  domain? 

20 

So  much  for  the  commercial  importance  of  Turkey,  and  especially  the 
Dardanelles.  It  is  evident  that  not  only  a very large trade, but the principal 
intercourse  of  Europe  with  Central  Asia,  and  consequently  the  principal 
means  of  re-civilizing  that  vast  region,  depends  upon  the  uninterrupted 
liberty  of  trading  through  these  gates  to  the  Black  Sea. 

25 

Now  for  the  military  considerations.  The  commercial  importance  of  the 
Dardanelles  and  Bosphorus  at once  make  them first-rate  military  positions, 
that is, positions of decisive influence in any war.  Such a point is Gibraltar, 
and  such is Helsingör in t he Sound. But the Dardanelles are, from the nature 
of  their  locality,  even more important. The cannon of Gibraltar or Helsingör 
cannot command the whole of the straits on which they are situated, and they 
require  the  assistance of a fleet in order to close them; while the narrowness 
30  of  the  strait  at  the  Dardanelles  and  of  the  Bosphorus  is  such  that  a  few 
properly-erected  and  well-armed  fortifications,  such  as  Russia,  once  in 
possession,  would not tarry an hour to erect,  might defy the combined  fleets 
of  the  world  if they attempted  a passage.  In that case, the  Black Sea would 
be  more  properly  a Russian lake than even the  Lake  of  Ladoga,  situated in 
35 its very heart. The resistance of the Caucasians would be starved out at once ; 
Trapezunt  would  be  a  Russian  port;  the  Danube  a  Russian  river.  Besides, 
when Constantinople  is  taken, the Turkish Empire is cut in two; Asiatic and 
•  European Turkey have no means of communicating with or supporting each 
other,  and  while  the  strength  of  the  Turkish  army,  repulsed  into  Asia,  is 
40  utterly harmless, Macedonia, Thessaly, Albania, outflanked and cut off from 
the  main  body,  will  not  put the  conqueror to  the  trouble  of  subduing them; 

79 

Friedrich  Engels 

they  will have  nothing  left but to  beg  for  mercy and for an army to maintain 
internal  order. 

5 

But  having  come  thus  far  on  the  way  to  universal  empire,  is  it  probable 
that this gigantic and  swollen power will pause in the career? Circumstances, 
if not her  own will, forbid  it.  With the annexation of Turkey and Greece she 
has  excellent  seaports, while the  Greeks furnish skillful  sailors for her navy. 
With Constantinople,  she  stands on the threshold of the Mediterranean; with 
Durazzo  and  the  Albanian  coast  from  Antivari  to  Arta,  she  is  in  the  very 
center  of  the  Adriatic,  within  sight of  the  British Ionian islands,  and within 
36 hours'  steaming of Malta. Flanking the Austrian dominions on the North,  10 
East  and  South, Russia will already count the Hapsburgs  among her vassals. 
And  then,  another  question  is  possible,  is  even probable.  The  broken  and 
undulating  western  frontier  of  the  Empire,  ill-defined  in  respect  of  natural 
boundaries,  would  call for  rectification,  and it would appear that the natural 
frontier  of  Russia runs  from  Dantzic  or  perhaps  Stettin  to  Trieste.  And  as  15 
sure  as  conquest  follows  conquest,  and  annexation  follows  annexation,  so 
sure  would  the  conquest  of  Turkey  by  Russia  be  only  the  prelude  for  the 
annexation  of  Hungary,  Prussia,  Galicia,  and for the ultimate realization of 
the  Slavonic  Empire  which certain fanatical  Panslavistic  philosophers  have 
dreamed  of. 

20 

Russia  is  decidedly  a  conquering  nation,  and  was  so  for  a  century,  until 
the  great  movement  of  1789  called  into  potent  activity  an  antagonist  of 
formidable  nature.  We  mean  the  European  Revolution,  the  explosive  force 
of  democratic  ideas  and  man's  native  thirst  for  freedom.  Since  that  epoch 
there have been in reality but two powers on the continent of Europe—Russia  25 
and  Absolutism,  the  Revolution  and Democracy.  For the moment the Revo 
lution  seems  to  be  suppressed,  but  it  lives  and  is  feared  as  deeply as  ever. 
Witness  the terror of the reaction at the news of the late rising at Milan.  But 
let  Russia  get  possession  of  Turkey,  and  her  strength  is  increased  nearly 
half,  and  she  becomes  superior to  all the rest of  Europe put together.  Such  30 
an event would  be  an unspeakable  calamity  to  the  revolutionary cause. The 
maintenance  of  Turkish  independence,  or  in  case  of  a  possible  dissolution 
of  the  Ottoman  Empire,  the  arrest  of  the  Russian  scheme  of  annexation is 
a  matter  of the  highest  moment.  In this  instance the interests  of the  revolu 
tionary Democracy and of  England go  hand  in hand. Neither can permit the  35 
Czar to  make Constantinople one of his  Capitals,  and we shall find that when 
driven  to  the  wall,  the  one  will  resist  him  as  determinedly  as  the  other.

5  Until this morning no further authentic news has been received from Turkey. 
The  Paris  Correspondent  of  The  Morning Herald,  of  to-day,  asserts  that  he 
has  been  informed  by  responsible  authority  that  the  Russians  have  entered 
Bucharest.  In  the  Courrier  de  Marseille  of  the  20th  inst.  we  read:  "We  are 
in  a  position to  convey  to  the  knowledge of our readers  the  substance  of the 
ι o note which has already been presented to the Sublime Porte by M. d'Oserof f 
immediately  after  the  departure  of  Count  Leiningen,  and  before  the  brutal 
'sortie'  of  the  Prince  Menchikoff  in  the  midst  of  the  Divan.  The  following 
are  the  principal  points  referred  to  in  this  diplomatic  note.  The  Count  de 
Nesselrode  complained  in  the  most  lively  terms  that  the  Porte,  in  spite  of 
its  formal  promise  not to  attack the Montenegrins,  had  carried  on  a  sangui­
nary  war  against  that  people,  which  had  given  the  greatest  dissatisfaction 
to the Cabinet of  St. Petersburgh. In order, now, to secure a sufficient protec­
tion  to  the  Montenegrins,  and  for  their  preservation  from  new  disasters, 
Russia  would  invite  the  Porte  to  recognize  the  independence  of  Montenegro. 
20  The note contained also a protest against the blockade of the Albanian Coast, 
and  in  conclusion  it  pressed  the  demand  upon  the  Sultan  to  dismiss  those 
ministers  whose  doings  had  always  occasioned  misunderstandings  between 
the two governments. On the receipt of this note Turkey is said to have shown 
a  disposition  to  yield,  although  with regret,  to  that one  point relating  to  the 
25  dismission  of  ministers,  particularly  of  Fuad  Effendi,  the  Sultan's  brother-
in-law,  who  has  actually been replaced by Rifaat Pasha,  a partisan  of Russia. 
The  Porte,  however,  refused  to  acknowledge  the  independence  of  Monte­
negro.  It  was  then  that  Prince  Menchikoff,  without  previously  paying  the 

81 

Karl  Marx 

usual  compliments  to  the  Minister  of  Foreign Affairs, presented  himself  in 
the Divan,  to the  neglect of  all diplomatic forms, and intimated in a bullying 
manner  to  that  body  to  subscribe  to  his  demands.  In  consequence  of  this 
demand  the  Porte  invoked  the  protection  of  England  and  France."

In  ancient  Greece,  an orator  who  was  paid  to  remain  silent,  was  said  to 
have  an  ox  on his  tongue. The  ox,  be  it remarked, was  a silver coin imported 
from  Egypt.  With  regard  to  The  Times,  we  may  say  that,  during  the  whole 
period  of  the  revived  Eastern  Question,  it had  also  an  ox  on  its  tongue,  if 
not  for  remaining  silent,  at least for  speaking.  At first,  this  ingenious  paper 
defended  the  Austrian  intervention in  Montenegro,  on  the  plea  of  Christi-  10 
anity.  But  afterwards,  when  Russia  interfered,  it  dropped  this  argument, 
stating  that the  whole question was a quarrel between the Greek and Roman 
Churches,  utterly  indifferent  to  the  "subjects"  of  the  Established  Church 
of  England.  Then,  it  dwelt  on  the  importance  of the Turkish commerce  for 
Great Britain,  inferring from  that very importance, that Great Britain could  15 
but  gain  by  exchanging  Turkish  Free-Trade  for  Russian  prohibition  and 
Austrian  protection.  It  next  labored  to  prove  that  England  was  dependent 
for her food upon Russia,  and must therefore bow in silence to the geographi 
cal ideas  of the  Czar.  A  gracious  compliment this  to the commercial system 
exalted  by  The  Times,  and  a  very  pleasant  argumentation,  that  to  mitigate 
England's  dependence  on  Russia,  the  Black  Sea  had  to  become  a  Russian 
lake,  and  the  Danube  a  Russian  river.  Then,  driven  from  these  untenable 
positions,  it fell back  on the  general  statement that the  Turkish Empire was 
hopelessly  falling  to  pieces,—a  conclusive  proof  this,  in  the  opinion of  The 
Times,  that  Russia  presently  must  become  the  executor  and  heir  of  that  25 
Empire.  Anon,  The  Times  wanted  to  subject  the  inhabitants  of  Turkey  to 
the  "pure  sway" and civilizing influence of Russia and Austria, remembering 
the  old  story  that  wisdom  comes  from  the  East,  and  forgetting  its  recent 
statement  that  "the  state  maintained  by  Austria  in  the  provinces  and king 
doms  of  her  own  Empire,  was  one  of  arbitrary  authority  and  of  executive  30 
tyranny, regulated by no laws  at all."  In conclusion and this is the strongest 
bit  of  impudence,  TZie  Times congratulates  itself  on  the  "brilliancy"  of  its 
Eastern  leaders! 

' 

20 

The  whole  London Press,  Morning Press  and Evening Press, Daily Press 
and Weekly Press  rose,  as  one  man against the "leading journal."  The Mor-  35 
ning Post mocks  at the  intelligence  of  its  brethren of  The  Times, whom  it  ac 
cuses  of  spreading  deliberately  false  and  absurd  news.  The Morning Herald 
calls  it  "our  Hebraeo-Austro-Russian  contemporary,"  The  Daily  News  more 
shortly  the  "Brunnow  organ."  Its  twin-brother,  The  Morning  Chronicle 
heaves  at  it  the  following  blow:  "The  journalists  who  have  proposed  to  40 
surrender  the  Turkish  Empire  to  Russia,  on  the  score  of  the  commercial 

82 

The  London  Press—Policy  of  Napoleon  on  the  Turkish  Question 

eminence of a dozen Anglo-Greek firms, are quite right in claiming for them 
selves  the  monopoly  of  brilliancy!"  The  Morning  Advertiser  says:  "The 
Times  is  right  in  stating  that  it  is  isolated  in  its  advocacy  of  Russian inter 
e s t s . .. It is printed in the English language. But that is the only thing English 

5  about it.  It  is,  where  Russia is  concerned,  Russian  all  over." 

10 

There  is  no  doubt that the  Russian bear will not draw  in his  paws, unless 
he  be  assured  of  a  momentary  "entente  cordiale"  between  England  and 
France.  Now  mark  the  following  wonderful  coincidence.  On  the  very  day 
when  The  Times was  trying  to  persuade  my lords  Aberdeen and Clarendon, 
that the  Turkish affair was a mere  squabble between France and Russia, the 
"roi  des  drôles"  as  Guizot used  to call him,  M. Granier de Cassagnac, hap 
pened  to  discover  in  the  Constitutionnel, that it was  all nothing but a quarrel 
between  Lord  Palmerston  and the  Czar.  Truly,  when  we  read  these  papers, 
we  understand  the  Greek  orators  with  Macedonian  oxen  on  their  tongues, 

15  at the  times  when  Demosthenes  fulminated his  Philippics. 

20 

As  for  the  British aristocracy represented by  the  Coalition Ministry, they 
would,  if  need be,  sacrifice  the national English interests  to their particular 
class  interests,  and  permit  the  consolidation  of  a  juvenile  despotism  in the 
East  in  the  hopes  of  finding  a  support  for  their  valetudinarian  oligarchy  in 
the  West.  As  to  Louis  Napoleon  he  is  hesitating.  All his predilections  are 
on  the  side  of  the  Autocrat,  whose  system  of  governing  he  has  introduced 
into France, and all his antipathies are against England, whose parliamentary 
system he has  destroyed there.  Besides,  if he permits  the  Czar's plundering 
in the  East,  the  Czar will perhaps permit him  to  plunder in the West. On the 
25 other hand he is as quite sure of the feelings of the Holy Alliance with regard 
to  the  "parvenu  Khan."  Accordingly  he  observes  an  ambiguous  policy,-
striving  to  dupe  the  great  powers  of Europe  as he  duped the parliamentary 
parties  of  the  French National  Assembly.  While  fraternizing ostentatiously 
with  the  English  ambassador  for  Turkey,  Lord  Stratford  de  Redcliffe,  he 
simultaneously cajoles the Russian Princess de Lieven with the most  flatter 
ing  promises,  and  sends  to  the  court  of  the  Sultan  M. De  la  Cour,  a  warm 
advocate  of  an  Austro-French  alliance,  in  contradistinction  to  an  Anglo-
French  one.  He  orders  the  Toulon  fleet  to  sail  to  the  Grecian  waters,  and 
then  announces  the  day  afterward,  in  the  Moniteur,  that  this  had been done 
35  without any previous communication with England.  While he orders one of 
his  organs,  the  Pays,  to  treat  the  Eastern  question  as  most  important  to 
France,  he  allows  the  statement  of  his  other organ, the  Constitutionnel, that 
Russian,  Austrian  and English interests are at stake in this question, but that 
France  has  only  a  very  remote  interest  in  it,  and  is  therefore  in  a  wholly 
independent position.  Which will outbid the other, Russia or England? That 
is  the  question  with  him.

The Turkish Question. 

5 

It is only of late that people in the West of Europe  and in America have been 
enabled  to  form  anything  like  a  correct  judgment of Turkish  affairs.  Up  to 
the  Greek  insurrection  Turkey  was,  to  all  intents  and  purposes  a  terra  in 
cognita, and the common notions floating about among the public were based 
more  upon  the  Arabian  Nights'  Entertainments  than  upon  any  historical 
facts.  Official  diplomatic  functionaries  having  been  on  the  spot,  boasted  a 
more  accurate  knowledge;  but  this,  too,  amounted  to  nothing,  as  none  of 
these  officials  ever  troubled  himself  to  learn  Turkish,  South  Slavonian,  or 
modern  Greek,  and  they  were  one  and  all  dependent  upon  the  interested  10 
accounts  of  Greek  interpreters  and  Frank  merchants.  Besides,  intrigues  of 
every  sort were always on hand to occupy the time of these lounging diploma 
tists,  among  whom  Joseph  von  Hammer,  the  German  historian  of  Turkey, 
forms  the  only  honorable  exception.  The  business  of  these  gentlemen was 
not with  the  people,  the  institutions,  the  social  state  of  the  country; it was  15 
exclusively  with  the  Court,  and  especially  with  the  Fanariote  Greeks,  wily 
mediators  between  two  parties  either  of  which  was  equally  ignorant of the 
real condition, power and resources of the other. The traditional notions  and 
opinions,  founded  upon  such  paltry  information,  formed  for  a  long  while, 
and  strange  to  say,  form  to  a great  extent even  now,  the  ground-work for  20 
all  the  action  of  Western  diplomacy  with  regard  to  Turkey. 

But while  England, France, and for a long time even Austria, were groping 
in  the  dark  for  a  defined  Eastern  policy,  another power  outwitted them  all. 
Russia  herself  semi-Asiatic  in  her  condition,  manners,  traditions  and  in 
stitutions,  found  men  enough  who  could  comprehend  the  real  state  and  25 
character  of  Turkey.  Her religion was  the  same  as  that of nine-tenths of the 
inhabitants  of  Turkey in Europe;  her language  almost identical with that of 
seven  millions  of  Turkish  subjects;  and  the  well-known facility with which 
a Russian  learns  to  converse  in,  if  not fully to  appropriate  a foreign tongue, 

84 

Ρ·1 

The Turkish Question 

made  it  an  easy  matter  for  her  agents,  well  paid  for  the  task,  to  acquaint 
themselves  completely  with  Turkish  affairs.  Thus  at  a  very  early period the 
Russian  Government  availed  itself  of  its  exceedingly  favorable  position  in 
the South-east of Europe. Hundreds of Russian agents perambulated Turkey, 
5  pointing out to the Greek Christians, the Orthodox Emperor as the head, the 
natural  protector,  and  the  ultimate  liberator  of  the  oppressed  Eastern 
Church,  and  to  the  South  Slavonians  especially,  pointing  out  that  same 
Emperor  as  the  almighty  Czar  who  was  sooner  or  later  to  unite  all  the 
branches  of  the  great  Slavic  race  under  one  sceptre,  and  to  make them  the 
ruling  race  of  Europe.  The  clergy  of  the  Greek  Church  very  soon  formed 
themselves  into  a  vast  conspiracy for the  spread of these  ideas.  The  Servian 
insurrection of  1804, the  Greek rising in 1821  were more or less directly urged 
on by  Russian gold  and Russian influence;  and wherever among the Turkish 
pachas  the  standard  of  revolt  was  raised  against  the  Central  Government, 
15  Russian  intrigues  and  Russian  funds  were  never  wanting;  and  when  thus, 
internal  Turkish  questions  had  entirely  perplexed  the  understanding  of 
Western  diplomatists  who  knew  no  more  about  the  real  subject than  about 
the man in the moon, then war was declared, Russian armies marched toward 
the  Balkan, and portion by portion the Ottoman Empire was dismembered. 

10

25 

It  is  true  that  during  the  last  thirty  years  much  has  been  done  toward 
general  enlightenment  concerning  the  state  of Turkey.  German philologists 
and  critics  have  made  us  acquainted with the  history  and literature, English 
residents  and  English  trade  have  collected  a great  deal  of  information  as  to 
the  social  condition  of  the  Empire.  But  the  diplomatic  wiseacres  seem  to 
scorn  all  this,  and  to  cling  as  obstinately  as  possible  to  the  traditions  en­
gendered  by  the  study  of  Eastern fairy-tales,  improved  upon  by the  no  less 
wonderful accounts given by the  most corrupt  set of Greek mercenaries  that 
ever  existed. 

And  what  has  been  the  natural  result?  That  in  all essential points  Russia 
30  has  steadily,  one  after  another,  gained  her  ends,  thanks  to  the  ignorance, 
dullness,  and  consequent  inconsistency  and  cowardice  of  Western  govern­
ments.  From  the  battle  of Navarino  to  the  present Eastern crisis, the action 
of  the  Western  powers  has  either  been  annihilated  by  squabbles  among 
themselves,  mostly  arising  from  their  common  ignorance  of  Eastern  mat-
ters,  and  from  petty  jealousies  which  must  have  been  entirely  incom­
prehensible  to  any  Eastern  understanding-or  that  action  has  been  in  the 
direct interest of  Russia  alone.  And  not only  do  the  Greeks,  both of Greece 
and  Turkey,  and  the  Slavonians,  look  to  Russia  as  their  natural  protector; 
nay,  even the  Government at Constantinople,  despairing, time after time, to 
40  make its actual wants and real position understood by these Western ambas­
sadors,  who  pride  themselves  upon  their  own  utter  incompetency  to  judge 

35 

85 

Friedrich  Engels 

by  their  own  eyes  of Turkish matters,  the very Turkish Government has  in 
every  instance  been  obliged  to  throw  itself  upon  the  mercy  of  Russia,  and 
to  seek  protection  from  that  power  which  openly  avows  its  firm  intention 
to  drive  every Turk  across  the Bosphorus  and plant the cross of St. Andrew 
upon  the  minarets  of the  Aya-Sofiyah. 

5 

10 

In  spite  of  diplomatic  tradition,  these  constant  and  successful  en 
croachments  of Russia have at last roused in the Western Cabinets in Europe 
a  very  dim  and  distant  apprehension  of  the  approaching  danger.  This  ap 
prehension  has  resulted  in  the  great  diplomatic  nostrum,  that  the  main 
tenance  of  the  status  quo  in  Turkey is  a  necessary  condition  of  the  peace 
of  the  world.  The  magniloquent  incapacity  of  certain  modern  statesmen 
could  not  have  confessed  its  ignorance  and  helplessness  more  plainly than 
in this  axiom which, from having always remained a dead letter, has, during 
the  short period  of twenty years, been hallowed by tradition,  and become as 
hoary  and  indisputable  as  King  John's  Magna  Charta.  Maintain  the  status  15 
quo! Why,  it was  precisely  to  maintain  the  status  quo  that Russia  stirred up 
Servia  to  revolt,  made  Greece  independent,  appropriated  to  herself  the 
protectorate  of  Moldavia  and  Wallachia,  and  retained  part  of  Armenia! 
England  and  France  never  stirred  an  inch  when  all  this  was  done,  and  the 
only time they did move was to protect, in 1849, not Turkey, but the Hungar-  20 
ian refugees.  In  the  eyes  of  European  diplomacy, and even of the European 
press,  the  whole  Eastern  question  resolves  itself  into  this  dilemma,  either 
the  Russians  at  Constantinople,  or  the  maintenance  of  the  status  quo— 
anything  beside  this  alternative  never  enters  their  thoughts. 

Look  at the  London press  for  illustration.  We  find  The  Times advocating  25 

the  dismemberment  of Turkey,  and proclaiming the unfitness  of the Turkish 
race to govern any longer in that beautiful corner of Europe. Skilfull as usual, 
The  Times boldly  attacks  the  old  diplomatic  tradition  of  the  status quo,  and 
declares  its  continuance  impossible.  The whole  of  the talent at the  disposal 
of  that  paper  is  exerted  to  show  this  impossibility under  different aspects,  30 
and  to  enlist  British  sympathies  for  a  new  crusade  against  the  remnant  of 
the  Saracens. The merit of such an unscrupulous attack upon a time-hallowed 
and  unmeaning  phrase  which,  two  months  ago,  was  as  yet  sacred  to  The 
Times,  is  undeniable.  But  whoever  knows  that paper,  knows  also  that  this 
unwonted  boldness is  applied directly in the interest of Russia and Austria.  35 
The  correct  premises  put  forth  in  its  columns  as  to  the  utter  impossibility 
of  maintaining  Turkey  in  its  present  state,  serve  no  other  purpose  than  to 
prepare  the  British public  and  the  world for  the  moment when  the principal 
paragraph of  the  will  of Peter the  Great, the conquest of the Bosphorus, will 
have become  an  accomplished fact. 

40 

The  opposite  opinion  is  represented  by  The Daily News,  the  organ  of the 

86 

The Turkish  Question 

5 

Liberals.  The  Times at least seizes  a new and correct feature of the question, 
in order  afterwards to pervert it to  an interested purpose.  In the columns of 
the  Liberal journal, on the  other hand,  reigns  the plainest sense, but merely 
a  sort  of  household  sense.  Indeed,  it  does  not  see  farther  than  the  very 
threshold  of  its  own  house.  It  clearly  perceives  that  a  dismemberment  of 
Turkey  under  present  circumstances  must  bring  the  Russians  to  Con 
stantinople,  and  that  this  would  be  a  great  misfortune  for  England;  that it 
would threaten the peace of the world, ruin the Black Sea trade, and necessi 
tate  new  armaments  in the  British  stations  and  fleets  of the  Mediterranean. 
10  And  in  consequence,  The Daily News exerts  itself to arouse the indignation 
and  fear  of  the  British  public.  Is  not  the  partition  of  Turkey  a  crime equal 
to  the  partition of Poland? Have  not the  Christians more religious  liberty in 
Turkey  than  in  Austria  and  Russia?  Is  not the Turkish  Government a  mild, 
paternal government, which allows  the different nations and creeds and local 
corporations to regulate their own affairs? Is not Turkey a paradise compared 
to  Austria  and Russia? Is not life and property  safe there? And is not British 
trade  with Turkey larger  than that with Austria and Russia put together, and 
does  it  not increase  every year? And then goes  on in dithyrambic  strain,  so 
far  as  The  Daily  News  can  be  dithyrambic,  an  apotheosis  of  Turkey,  the 
20  Turks  and  everything Turkish,  which  must  appear  quite  incomprehensible 

15 

to  most  of  its  readers. 

The key to this  strange enthusiasm for the Turks is to be found in the works 
of David Urquhart, Esq., M.P. This gentleman, of Scotch birth, with medieval 
and  patriarchal  recollections  of  home,  and  with  a  modern  British  civilized 
25  education,  after  having  fought  three  years  in  Greece  against  the  Turks, 
passed  into  their  country  and was the first thus to enamour himself of them. 
The  romantic  Highlander  found  himself  at  home  again  in  the  mountain 
ravines  of  the  Pindus  and  Balkan,  and  his  works  on  Turkey,  although  full 
of valuable information, may be summed up in the following three paradoxes, 
30  which are laid down almost literally thus: If Mr. Urquhart were not a British 
subject, he would decidedly prefer being a Turk; if he were not a Presbyterian^ 
Calvinist,  he  would  not  belong  to  any  other  religion  than  Islamism;  and 
thirdly,  Britain  and  Turkey  are  the  only  two  countries  in  the  world  which 
enjoy  self-government  and  civil  and  religious  liberty.  This  same  Urquhart 
35  has  since  become  the  great  Eastern  authority for  all  English  Liberals  who 
object  to  Palmerston,  and  it  is  he  who  supplies  The  Daily News  with  the 
materials  for  these  panegyrics  upon  Turkey. 

The  only  argument  which  deserves  a  moment's  notice,  upon  this  side  of 
the  question  is  this:  "It  is  said  that  Turkey  is  decaying;  but  where  is  the 
40  decay?  Is  not civilization rapidly  spreading in Turkey and trade  extending? 
Where you see nothing but decay, our statistics prove nothing but progress."

Now  it would  be  a great fallacy to  put down the  increasing Black  Sea trade 
to  the  credit  of  Turkey  alone,  and  yet  this  is  done  here  exactly  as  if  the 
industrial and commercial capabilities of Holland, the high road to the greater 
part  of  Germany,  were  to  be  measured  by  her  gross  exports  and  imports, 
nine tenths of which represent a mere transit. And yet, what every statistician 
would  immediately, in the  case of Holland, treat as a clumsy concoction,  the 
whole  of  the  liberal press  of  England,  including the  learned  Economist tries, 
in  the  case  of  Turkey,  to  impose  upon  public  credulity.  And then,  who  are 
the traders in Turkey? Certainly not the Turks. Their way of promoting trade, 
when  they  were  yet  in  their  original  nomadic  state,  consisted  in  robbing  10 
caravans,  and now that they  are  a little  more  civilized it consists  in all sorts 
of  arbitrary  and  oppressive  exactions.  The  Greeks,  the  Armenians,  the 
Slavonians  and  the  Franks  established  in  the  large  seaports,  carry  on  the 
whole  of  the  trade,  and certainly they have no reason to thank Turkish Beys 
and Pashas for being able to do so. Remove all the Turks out of Europe, and  15 
trade will have no reason to  suffer.  And as to progress in general civilization, 
who  are  they  that  carry  out  that progress  in all parts  of  European Turkey? 
Not  the  Turks,  for  they  are  few  and far  between,  and  can hardly be  said to 
be  settled anywhere except in Constantinople and two or three small country 
districts. It is the Greek and Slavonic middle class in all the towns and trading  20 
posts who are the real support of whatever civilization is effectually imported 
into  the  country.  That part of  the population are constantly rising in wealth 
and  influence, and the Turks are more and more driven into the background. 
Were  it not for  their  monopoly of  civil  and military power, they would soon 
disappear. But that monopoly has become impossible for the future, and their 
power  is  turned  into  impotence,  except  for  obstructions  in  the  way of pro 
gress.  The  fact  is,  they  must  be  got  rid  of.  To  say  that  they  cannot  be  got 
rid of except by putting Russians and Austrians in their place, means as much 
as  to  say,  that  the present political  constitution of  Europe will last forever. 
Who  will  make  such an assertion?

The  Berlin Conspiracy. 

Correspondence  of  The  N.Y.Tribune. 

London, Friday,  April  1,  1853. 

At length,  the fifth of  the  "Great Powers,"  Prussia, enjoys  the good fortune 
of  having  added  of  her  own  to  the  great  discoveries  made  by  the  Austrian 
Police, with respect to the "demagogical machinations" of the revolutionists. 
"The  Government,"  we  are  assured  by its  official  organs,  "having obtained 
proof  that  the  chiefs  of  the  Democratic party  held  continued relations  with 
the  revolutionary propaganda,  ordered  domiciliary  visits  to  be  made, on the 
29th  of  March,  at  Berlin,  and  succeeded  in  arresting 40 individuals,  among 
whom were Streckfuss, and the ex-members of the Prussian National Assem 
bly,  Berends,  Waldeck,  etc.  Domiciliary  visits  were  made  in  the  houses of 
eighty persons  suspected of participation  in  a conspiracy.  Arms and amuni-
tion  were  found."  Not  content  with publishing these  "startling facts"  in its 
official  papers,  the  Prussian  Government  thought  proper  to  forward  them 
by  telegraph  to  the  British  Foreign  Office. 

In  order  to  lay  bare  the  mystery  of  this  new  police  farce,  it  is  necessary 
to  go  somewhat  back.  Two  months  after  the  coup  d'état  of  Bonaparte, 
Mr. Hinckeldey,  the  Polizei Praesident of Berlin and his inferior, Mr.  Stieber, 
the  Polizei Rath,  conspired  together,  the  one  to  become  a Prussian  Maupas, 
and  the  other  to  become  a Prussian Pietri.  The  glorious  omnipotence  of  the 
French  police,  perhaps,  disturbed  their  slumbers.  Hinckeldey  addressed 
himself  to  Herr  von Westphalen,  the  Minister of the Interior, making unjust 
representation  to  that  wealaninded  and  fanatical  reactionist  (Herr  von 
Westphalen  being  my  brother-in-law  I  had  ample  opportunity of  becoming 
acquainted  with  the  mental  powers  of  the  man),  on  the  necessity  of  con 
centrating  the  whole  police  force  of  the  Prussian  State  in  the  hands  of the 

89 

Karl  Marx 

Polizei Praesident of  Berlin.  He  stated,  that in order to  accelerate  the  action 
of  the  police,  it  must  be  made  independent  of  the  Minister  of  the  Interior 
and  intrusted  exclusively  to  himself.  The  minister  von  Westphalen  re 
presents  the  ultra  Prussian  aristocracy  and  the  President  of  the  ministry, 
Herr  von  Manteuff  el,  represents  the  old  bureaucracy;  the  two  are  rivals,  and  5 
the  former  beheld  in  the  suggestion  of  Hinckeldey,  although  it  apparently 
narrowed the circle of his own department, a means of inflicting a blow on his 
rival, whose  brother, M.  von Manteuffel, was  the  director in the ministry of 
the Interior, and especially charged with the control of the entire police. Herr 
von  Westphalen  therefore  submitted  his  proposition  to  a  council  of  State,  10 
presided  over  by  the  King  himself. 

The  discussion  was  very  angry.  Manteuffel,  supported  by  the  Prince  of 
Prussia,  opposed  the  plan of  establishing  an independent ministry of police. 
The King inclined to the proposition of Herr von Westphalen, and concluded 
with  the  Solomonian  sentence,  that he  would  follow  the example of Bona-  15 
parte  and  create  a  ministry  of  police,  "if  the  necessity  of  that  step  were 
proved  to  him  by  facts."  Now,  the  affair  of  the  Cologne  Communists  was 
chosen  by  Hinckeldey  and  Stieber  to  furnish these facts.  You are  aware  of 
the  heroic  performances  of  those  men  in  the  Cologne  trials.  After  their 
conclusion  the  Prussian  Government  resolved  to  elevate  the  openly  perjured  20 
Stieber,  the  man  who  had  been  hissed  wherever  he  showed  himself  in  the 
streets  of  Cologne—to  the  dignity  of  a  Polizei-Director of  Cologne.  But M. 
de  Bethmann-Hollweg  and  other  well-meaning  conservative  deputies  of 
Rhenish Prussia,  intervened,  representing to the ministers that such an open 
insult  to  the  public  opinion  of  that province might have very ominous con-  25 
sequences at a moment when Bonaparte coveted the natural limits of France. 
The  Government  yielded,  contenting  itself  with  the  nomination  of  Stieber 
as  Polizei-Director  of  Berlin,  in  reward  for  his  perjuries  committed  at 
Cologne  and  his  thefts  committed  at  London.  There,  however,  the  affair 
stopped.  It was impossible to  accomplish the wishes  of Mr. Hinckeldey and  30 
to  create  for  him  an  independent  ministry  of  police  on  the  ground  of  the 
Cologne  trial.  Hinckeldey  and  Stieber  watched  their  time.  Happily  there 
came the  Milan insurrection.  Stieber  at once  made  twenty arrests  at Berlin. 
But the thing was too ridiculous to be proceeded with. But then came Libeny, 
and now the King was ripe.  Overwhelmed with fearful apprehensions he saw  35 
at  once  the  necessity  of  having  an  independent  ministry  of  police,  and 
Hinckeldey  saw  his  dreams  realized.  A  royal  ordinance  created  him  the 
Prussian  Maupas,  while  the  brother  of  Herr  von  Manteuffel  tendered  his 
resignation.  The  most  astounding  part  of  the  comedy, however,  was  yet to 
come.  Scarcely  had  Mr. Hinckeldey  rushed  into  his  new  dignity  when the  40 
"great  Berlin  conspiracy"  was  discovered  directly.  This  conspiracy,  then, 

90 

The  Berlin  conspiracy 

5 

was  made  for the  express  purpose  of proving the  necessity of Mr. Hinckel 
dey.  It  was  the  present  Mr. Hinckeldey  made  over  to  the  imbecile  King  in 
exchange  for  his  newly-gained  police-autocracy.  Hinckeldey's  adjunct,  the 
ingenious  Stieber,  who  had discovered at Cologne that whenever letters were 
found  terminating  with  the  words  "Gruss" and  "Bruderschaft," there  was 
unquestionably a Communist conspiracy, now made the discovery that there 
appeared  at  Berlin  for  some  time  since  an ominous  quantity of  "Calabrese 
hats,"  and that the  Calabrese hat was unquestionably the  "rallying  sign"  of 
the  revolutionists.  Strong  upon  this  important  discovery,  Stieber  made  on 
the  18th  of  March  several  arrests,  chiefly  of  workmen  and  foreigners,  the 
charge against whom was the wearing of Calabrese hats.  On the 23d ejusdem 
domiciliary  visits  were  made  in  the  house  of  Karl  Delius,  a  merchant  at 
Magdeburg  and  brother  of  a member of  the  Second  Chamber, who had also 
an  unhappy  taste  for  Calabrese  hats.  Finally,  as  I  informed  you  at  the  be-
15  ginning  of  this  letter,  on  the  29th  ultimo  the  great  coup  d'état against  the 
Calabrese  hats  was  struck  at  Berlin.  All  those  who  know  anything  of  the 
milk-and-water opposition of Waldeck, Berends, etc., will laugh at the "arms 
inoffensive 
and  munition" 
Brutusses.

But futile  as  this  police  comedy  may  appear  to  be  got  up,  as  it  were, by 
mere  personal  motives  of  Messrs.  Hinckeldey  &  Stieber,  it is  not  without 
significance.  The  Prussian  government  is  exasperated  at  the  passive  re 
sistance  it  meets  with in every direction.  It  smells  the  breath of Revolution 
in  midst  of  the  apparent  apathy.  It  despairs  at  the  want  of  a  tangible  form 
25 of that specter, and feels alleviated, as it were, from the nightmare every time 
the  police  affords  bodily  shapes  to  its  ubiquitous  but  invisible  antagonist. 
It  attacks,  it  will  go on attacking, and it will  successfully convert the passive 
resistance  of  the  people  into  an  active  one.

What is to Become of Turkey in Europe? 

We  have  seen  how  the  obstinate  ignorance,  the  time-hallowed  routine,  the 
hereditary  mental drowsiness of European statesmen,  shrinks from the very 
attempt  to  answer  this  question.  Aberdeen  and  Palmerston,  Metternich  and 
Guizot, not to mention their republican and constitutional substitutes of 1848 
to  1852—who  will  ever  be  nameless—all  despair  of  a  solution. 

And  all  the  while  Russia  advances  step  by  step,  slowly,  but  irresistibly, 
towards  Constantinople,  in  spite  of  all  the  diplomatic  notes,  plots  and 
manœuvres  of  France  and  England. 

5 

Now this steady advance of Russia, admitted by all parties, in all countries 
of  Europe,  has  never  been  explained  by  official  statesmen.  They  see  the 
effect,  they  see  even the  ultimate  consequence,  and  yet the  cause  is  hidden 
from  them,  although  nothing  is  more  simple. 

10 

The  great motive  power  which  speeds Russia on towards  Constantinople, 
is nothing but the very device, designed to keep her away from it; the hollow, 15 
the  never-enforced  theory  of  the  status  quo. 

What  is  this  status  quo?For  the  Christian  subjects  of  the  Porte,  it means 
simply the  maintenance for ever and a day, of Turkish oppression over them. 
As long as they are oppressed by Turkish rule, the head of the Greek Church, 
the  ruler of  sixty millions  of  Greek Christians,  be  he in other respects  what  20 
he  may,  is  their  natural  liberator  and protector.  Thus  it  is,  that  ten millions 
of Greek Christians  in European Turkey,  are  forced to appeal to Russian aid, 
by  that  very  diplomatic  scheme,  invented  in  order  to  prevent  Russian  en 
croachments. 

Look  at  the  facts  as  history  records  them.  Even  before  the  reign  of  25 

Catharine  Π.  Russia  never  omitted  an  opportunity  of  obtaining  favorable 
conditions  for  Moldavia  and  Wallachia.  These  stipulations,  at  last,  were 
carried  to  such  a  length  in  the  Treaty  of  Adrianople  (1829)  that the  above-
named  principalities  are  now  more  subject to  Russia than to Turkey. When, 

92 

What  is  to  Become  of Turkey  in  Europe? 

in  1804,  the  Servian  revolution  broke  out,  Russia  took  the  rebel  Rayahs  at 
once  under  her protection,  and  in two  treaties,  after having  supported them 
in  two  wars,  guaranteed  the  internal  independence  of  their  country.  When 
the  Greeks  revolted,  who  decided the  contest? Not the  plots  and  rebellions 
5  of  Ah  Pacha  of  Janina,  not  the  battle  of  Navarino,  not the  French army in 
the  Morea,  not  the  conferences  and protocols  of  London,  but the  march of 
Diebitch's  Russians  across  the  Balkan  into  the  vally  of  the  Maritza.  And 
while  Russia thus  fearlessly  set  about the  dismemberment  of  Turkey, west 
ern  diplomatists  continued  to  guarantee  and to  hold up  as  sacred  the  status 

10  quo and  the  inviolability  of  the  Ottoman territory! 

So  long  as  the  tradition  of  the  upholding,  at  any  price,  of  the  status  quo 
and  the  independence  of Turkey in her present  state is  the ruling maxim of 
Western diplomacy,  so  long will Russia be  considered, by nine tenths of the 
population  of  Turkey  in  Europe,  their  only  support,  their  liberator,  their 

15  Messiah. 

Now,  suppose  for  a  moment  that  Turkish  rule  in  the  Graeco-Slavonian 
peninsula  were  got  rid  of;  that  a government more  suitable  to  the  wants  of 
the  people  existed;  what  then  would  be  the  position  of Russia? The fact is 
notorious, that in every one of the States which have sprung up upon Turkish 
soil  and  acquired  either  total  or partial independence, a powerful anti-Rus 
sian party has formed itself. If that be the case at a time when Russian support 
is  their  only  safeguard  against  Turkish  oppression,  what,  then,  are  we  to 
expect,  as  soon  as  the  fear  of  Turkish  oppression  shall  have  vanished? 

But  to  remove  Turkish  authority  beyond  the  Bosphorus;  to  emancipate 
the  various  creeds  and nationalities  which populate  the  peninsula;  to open 
the  door  to  the  schemes  and  machinations,  the conflicting desires  and inter 
ests  of all the great powers  of Europe;—why is  not this provoking universal 
war?  Thus  asks  diplomatic  cowardice  and  routine. 

20 

25 

Of  course,  it  is  not  expected  that  the  Palmerstons,  the  Aberdeens,  the 
30  Clarendons, the Continental  Foreign Secretaries, will do  such a thing. They 
cannot  look  at  it  without  shuddering.  But  whosoever  has,  in  the  study  of 
history,  learned  to  admire  the  eternal  mutations  of  human  affairs  in which 
nothing is  stable but instability, nothing constant but change; whosoever has 
followed  up  that  stern  march of history whose wheels pass relentlessly over 
the  remains  of  empires,  crushing  entire  generations,  without  holding them 
worthy  even  of  a  look  of  pity;  whosoever,  in  short,  has  had  his  eyes  open 
to  the  fact  that there  was  never  a  demagogic  appeal or  insurgent proclama 
tion,  as  revolutionary  as  the  plain  and  simple  records  of  the  history  of 
mankind;  who  ever  knows  how  to  appreciate  the  eminently  revolutionary 
40  character  of  the  present  age,  when  steam  and  wind,  electricity  and  the 
printing  press,  artillery  and  gold  discoveries  cooperate  to  produce  more 

35 

93 

Friedrich  Engels 

changes  and  revolutions  in  a year  than were  ever before brought  about in  a 
century,  will  certainly  not  shrink from  facing  a  historical  question,  because 
of  the  consideration that its  proper  settlement  may bring  about  a European 
war. 

No,  diplomacy,  Government according to  the old fashion will never solve 
the  difficulty.  The  solution of the Turkish problem is  reserved,  with that of 
other  great  problems,  to  the  European  Revolution.  And  there  is  no  pre 
sumption in  assigning  this  apparently remote  question  to  the  lawful  domain 
of  that  great  movement.  The  revolutionary  landmarks  have  been  steadily 
advancing  ever  since  1789.  The  last  revolutionary  outposts  were  Warsaw,  10 
Debreczin,  Bucharest;  the  advanced  posts  of  the  next  revolution  must  be 
Petersburg  and  Constantinople.  They  are  the  two  vulnerable  points  where 
the  Russian  anti-revolutionary  colossus  must  be  attacked. 

5 

It  would  be  a  mere  effort  of  fancy  to  give  a  detailed  scheme  as  to  how 
the  Turkish  territory  in  Europe  might  be  partitioned  out.  Twenty  such  15 
schemes  could  be  invented,  every  one  as  plausible  as  the  other.  What  we 
have  to  do  is,  not  to  draw  up  fanciful  programmes,  but  to  seek  general 
conclusions from  indisputable facts. And from this point of view the question 
presents  a  double  aspect. 

Firstly, then, it is an undeniable reality that the peninsula, commonly called 20 

Turkey in Europe, forms the natural inheritance of the South-Slavonian race. 
That race furnishes  seven millions out of twelve of its inhabitants. It has been 
in  possession  of  the  soil  for  twelve  hundred  years.  Its  competitors—if  we 
except  a  sparse  population which  has  adopted the Greek language, although 
in  reality  of  Slavonic  descent—are Turkish or Arnaut barbarians, who have  25 
long  since been convicted  of  the most inveterate  opposition to  all progress. 
The  South-Slavonians,  on  the  contrary,  are,  in  the  inland  districts  of  the 
country,  the  exclusive representatives  of  civilization.  They  do  not yet form 
a  nation,  but  they  have  a  powerful  and  comparatively  enlightened  nucleus 
of nationality in Servia. The Servians have a history, a literature of their own. 30 
They  owe  their  present  internal  independence  to  an eleven years'  struggle, 
carried on valiantly against superior numbers. They have, for the last twenty 
years, grown rapidly in culture and the means of civilization. They are looked 
upon  by  the  Christians  of  Bulgaria,  Thrace,  Macedonia  and  Bosnia  as  the 
center,  around  which,  in  their  future  efforts  for  independence  and  nation-  35 
ality,  all  of them  must rally.  In fact,  it may be  said that, the more Servia and 
Servian  nationality has  consolidated itself,  the  more has  the  direct influence 
of  Russia on the  Turkish  Slavonians  been thrown into  the  back ground;  for 
Servia, in order to maintain its  distinct position as  a Christian State, has been 
obliged  to  borrow  from  the  West  of  Europe  its  political  institutions,  its  40 
schools,  its  scientific  knowledge,  its  industrial  appliances;  and  thus  is  ex-

94 

What  is  to  Become  of  Turkey  in  Europe? 

plained  the  anomaly,  that,  in  spite  of Russian protection,  Servia,  ever  since 
her  emancipation,  has  formed  a  constitutional  monarchy. 

5 

Whatever  may  be  the  bonds  which  consanguinity  and  common religious 
belief  may  draw  between  the  Russian  and  the  Turkish  Slavonians,  their 
interests will be  decidedly opposite from the day the latter are emancipated. 
The commercial necessities  arising from the geographical position of the two 
countries  explain  this.  Russia,  a  compact  inland  country,  is  essentially  a 
country  of  predominant  agricultural,  and  perhaps,  one  day,  manufacturing 
production.  The Graeco-Slavonian peninsula, small in extent, comparatively, 
10  with an enormous  extent of  shore on three  seas, one of which it commands, 
is  now  essentially  a  country  of  commercial  transit,  though  with  the  best 
capacities for independent production. Russia is monopolizing, South Slavo-
nia is  expansive.  They  are,  besides,  competitors  in  Central Asia; but while 
Russia has every interest to exclude all but her own produce, South Slavonia 
15  has,  even  now,  every  interest  to  introduce  into  the  Eastern  markets  the 
produce  of  Western  Europe.  How,  then,  is  it possible  for  the  two  nations 
to  agree?  In fact,  the Turkish South Slavonians  and Greeks have, even now, 
far  more  interests  in  common  with  Western Europe than with Russia.  And 
as  soon as  the  line of railway,  which now extends from Ostende, Havre and 
20 Hamburg to Pesth shall have been continued to Belgrade and Constantinople, 
(which is  now under consideration,) the influence of Western civilization and 
Western  trade  will  become  permanent  in  the  South-east  of  Europe. 

Again:  The  Turkish  Slavonians  especially  suffer  by  their  subjection to  a 
Mussulman  class  of  military  occupants  whom  they  have  to  support.  These 
25  military occupants unite in themselves all public functions, military, civil and 
judicial.  Now what is the  Russian  system of government,  wherever it is not 
mixed up with feudal institutions, but a military occupation, in which the civil 
and  judicial  hierarchy  are  organized  in  a  military  manner,  and  where  the 
people  have  to  pay  for  the  whole?  Whoever  thinks  that  such  a  system  can 
30  have a charm for the  South Slavonians, may study the history of Servia since 
1804.  Kara  George,  the  founder  of  Servian  independence,  was  abandoned 
by  the  people,  and  Milosh  Obrenovitch,  the  restorer of that independence, 
was  ignominiously  turned  out  of  the  country,  because  they  attempted  to 
introduce  the  Russian  autocratic  system,  accompanied with its concomitant 

35  corruption,  half-mihtary  bureaucracy  and  pasha-like  extortion. 

Here  then is  the  simple  and final solution of the question.  History and the 
facts  of the  present  day  alike point to the erection of a free and independent 
Christian State on the ruins of the Moslem Empire in Europe. The next effort 
of  the  Revolution  can  hardly  fail  to  render  such  an  event  necessary,  for  it 
40  can  hardly  fail  to  inaugurate  the  long-maturing  conflict  between  Russian 
Absolutism  and  European  Democracy.  In  that  conflict  England  must  bear 

95 

Friedrich  Engels 

a  part,  in  whatever  hands  her  Government  may  for  the  moment happen to 
be  placed.  She  can  never  allow  Russia  to  obtain  possession  of  Con 
stantinople.  She must then, take  sides with the enemies of the Czar and favor 
the  construction  of  an  independent  Slavonian  Government  in  the  place  of 
the  effete  and  overthrown  Sublime  Porte.  For the present, the duty of those 
who  would  forward the  popular  cause  in  Europe  is  to  lend  all  possible  aid 
to the development of industry, education, obedience to law, and the instinct 
of freedom  and  independence  in  the Christian dependencies of Turkey.  The 
future  peace  and  progress  of  the  world  are  concerned  in it.  If  there  it to  be 
a  harvest,  too  much  care  cannot be  given to  the preparation of the  soil  and  10 
the  sowing  of  the  seed.

The Berlin Conspiracy-
London Police—Mazzini—Radetzky. 

Correspondence  of  The  N.Y.Tribune. 

London,  Friday,  April 8,  1853. 

5  At  the  time  of  writing  my  last  letter  concerning  the  great  conspiracy  dis­
covered  by  Mr. Stieber,  I  could  not  anticipate,  that  my  views  on  that  affair 
would  be  more  or  less  confirmed  by  two  Conservative  Berlin  papers.  The 
Preussische  Wochenblatt,  the  organ  of  the  Conservative  faction  headed  by 
Mr.  von  Bethmann-Hollweg,  was  confiscated  on  April  2d for recommending 
its  readers  "not to  believe too hastily in the tales of the police respecting the 
late  arrests."  But  of  far  greater  importance  is  an  article  in  the  Zeit,  the 
semi-official journal belonging  to the  section of the Prussian Ministry headed 
by  M.  von  Manteuffel.  The  Zeit  is  compelled  to  make  the  following  ad­
mission: 

10 

15 

"Whosoever  is  not  struck  with  blindness,  cannot  but  be  aware  that  the 
numerous  and  inextricable  complications  presented by the general  situation 
of Europe must lead in a given time, to  a violent explosion, which the sincere 
endeavors  of  the  Great Powers  of  Europe  may  postpone  for  a while,  but to 
prevent  which  in  a permanent  way  they  are  utterly  unable,  notwithstanding 
20  all  human  exertions  . ..  It  is  for  us  the  accomplishment  of  a  duty  not  to 
dissimulate  any  longer,  that  discontent  is  spreading wider  and  wider  and  is 
the  more  dangerous  and  the more  deserving of serious  attention,  as it appears 
not  at  the  surface  but  conceals  itself more  and  more  in  the  depth  of men's 
minds.  This  discontent,  we  must  say  without  paraphrase,  is  created by  the 
efforts  to  bring  about  a  counter-revolution  in  Prussia latterly  paraded  with 
an  incredible  étourderie." 

25 

The  Zeit is  only  mistaken  in  its  conclusion.  The  Prussian  counter-revolu-

97 

Karl  Marx 

tion  is  not  now  about  to  be  commenced,  it  is  to  be  ended.  It  is  not  a  thing 
of  recent  growth,  but  began  on  March  20th,  1848,  and  has  been  steadily 
advancing ever  since that day. At this very moment the Prussian Government 
is  hatching  two  very  dangerous  projects,  the  one  of  limiting  the  free  sub 
division  of  real  property,  the  other  subjecting  public  instruction  to  the 
Church.  They  could  not  have  selected  two  objects  more  appropriate  to 
alienate  the  peasantry  of Rhenish Prussia and the middle classes throughout 
the  monarchy.  As  a  curious  incident,  I  may  also  mention  the  forced  dis 
solution  of  the  Berlin  Hygienic  Society,  (A  Mutual  Benefit  Sick  Club)  in 
consequence  of the "great discovery." This society was composed of nearly  10 
10,000  members,  all  belonging  to  the  working  classes.  The  Government,  it 
appears,  are  convinced,  that  the  present  constitution  of  the  Prussian  State 
is  incompatible  with  "hygienics." 

5 

The  London  press,  till  now  unconscious  of  the  doings  of  the  London 
police,  are  surprised by  statements  in  the  Vienna  Presse and the  Emancipa-  15 
tion,  the  leading  reactionary  journal  of  Belgium,  that the police  of  London 
have  drawn  up  a  list  of  all  the  political  refugees  in that city,  with a variety 
of  details  relating  to  their  private  circumstances  and  conduct.  "Once  such 
a  system  is  tolerated  with  regard  to  foreigners,"  exclaims  the  Morning 
Advertiser,  "it will be employed whenever deemed advisable by the Govern- 
ment,  or  any  member  of  it,  in  order  to  become  acquainted  with the  details 
of  the  private  lives  of  our  own  countrymen  . ..  Is  it not  saddening to think 
that  the  London  police  should  be  called  upon  to  play  the  infamous  part 
assigned  to  their  continental  colleagues?"  Besides these  statements  in  Bel 
gian and other papers, the London press is this day informed by telegraphic  25 
dispatch  from  Vienna,  "that  the  Refugee  question  is  settled:  the  British 
Government has  promised to keep  a strict guard on the refugees,  and to visit 
them with the full  severity of the law whenever it should be proved that they 
have  taken  part  in  revolutionary  intrigues." 

20 

"Never  before,"  remarks  the  Morning Advertiser,  "did  England  appear 
in  so  humiliating  a  situation  as  she  does  now,  in  having  prostrated  herself 
to  the  feet  of  Austria.  No  degradation could  equal this.  It was  reserved for 
the  Coalition  Cabinet." 

30 

I  learn  from  a  very  creditable  source  that  the  law  officers  of  the  Crown 
will  institute a prosecution against Mazzini as  soon as his  sojourn at London  35 
shall  be  ascertained.  On  the  other  hand  I  hear  that  the  Ministers  will  be 
interpellated  in  the  House  of  Commons  with  regard  to  their  scandalous 
transactions  with  Austria,  and  their  intentions  on  the  refugee  question  in 
general. 

I  have  stated  in  a  former  letter  that  Radetzky  was  glad  to  have  been  40 

afforded,  by  the  Milan  insurrection,  a  pretext  for  "obtaining  money  under 

98 

The  Berlin  Conspiracy—London  Police—Mazzini—Radetzky 

false  pretenses."  This  view  of  the  matter  has  since  been  confirmed  by  an 
act not to be  misunderstood.  In a recent proclamation Radetzky has declared 
null  and  void  all  loans  or  mortgages  contracted  since  1847  on  the  security 
of the  sequestrated estates of the Lombard emigrants.  This confiscation can 
have  no  other  possible  excuse  than  the  horror  vacui  of  the  Austrian  ex 
chequer.  The  sentimental bourgeoisie  have  everywhere  sacrificed  the revo 
lution  to  their  god  called  Property.  The  counter-revolution  now  repudiates 
that  god. 

A  sub-marine  telegraphic  dispatch  of  to-day  brings  the  news  that Prince 
Menchikoff  has  concluded  a  convention  with  the  Porte,  that  the  Russian 
armies  have  received  orders  to  retire  from  the  Turkish  frontiers,  and  that 
the  Eastern  question  is  once  more  settled.

Hirsch's  Selbstbekenntnisse. 

Hirsch's  „Selbstbekenntnisse"  haben,  wie  mir  scheint,  nur  so  weit  Werth, 
als  sie  durch  andre  Thatsachen  bestätigt  werden.  Schon  weil  sie  sich 
wechselseitig  widersprechen.  Von  seiner Mission nach Coin zurückgekehrt, 
erklärte  er  in  einer  öffentlichen  Arbeiterversammlung,  Willich  sei  sein 
Complice.  Es  wurde  natürlich  verschmäht,  dies  angebliche  Bekenntniß  zu 
protokolliren.  Verschiedene  Personen,  ich  weiß  nicht,  ob  mit  oder  ohne 
Auftrag  Hirsch's,  zeigten  mir  darauf  an,  Hirsch  sei  erbötig,  mir  ein  volles 
Geständniß  abzulegen.  Ich  lehnte  es  ab.  Später  erfuhr  ich,  er  lebe  im 
äußersten Elend.  Ich zweifle  daher nicht, daß  seine  „allerletzten" Bekennt- 
nisse  im  Interesse  der  Partei  geschrieben  sind,  die  ihn  augenblicklich  zahlt 
Sonderbar,  daß  es  Leute  giebt,  die  es  nöthig  finden,  sich  unter  den  Schutz 
eines  Hirsch's  zu  flüchten. 

5 

10 

Ich beschränke mich einstweilen auf einige Randglossen. Wir hatten mehr 
Selbstbekenntnisse  von Spionen, von Vidocq, Chenu,  Delahodde  u. s. w.  In  15 
einem  Punkt  stimmen  sie  überein.  Sie  alle  sind  keine  ordinairen  Spione, 
sondern  Spione  im  höhern  Sinn,  lauter  Fortsetzungen  des  „Cooper'schen 
Spions".  Ihre  Selbstbekenntnisse  sind nothwendig ebenso  viel  Selbstapolo-
gieen. 

So  sucht  auch  Hirsch  z. B.  anzudeuten,  nicht er, Hirsch,  sondern Oberst  20 

Bangya habe  den Tag  der Zusammenkunft meiner Parteigenossen  dem Greif 
denuncirt  und  durch  Greif  dem  Fleury.  Unsere  Zusammenkünfte fanden an 
einem Donnerstag statt, in den paar Sitzungen, denen Hirsch beiwohnte, aber 
an  einem  Mittwoch,  seit  Hirsch  aus  ihnen  ausgestoßen  war.  Die  falschen 
Sitzungsprotokolle,  vor  wie  nach  Hirsch's  Beiwohnen,  sind  von  einem  25 
Donnerstag  datirt.  Wer  außer  Hirsch  konnte  dies  „Mißverständniß"  be 
gehen! 

In  einem  andern  Punkt  ist  Hirsch  glücklicher.  Bangya  soll  wiederholt 

Ό1 τ*; ."V· ?•*·» ·*.«, 

Hirschs  Selbstbekenntnisse 

Daten in  Bezug auf meinen Briefwechsel mit Deutschland  angegeben haben. 
Da  alle  hierauf  bezüglichen  und  in  den  Kölner  Gerichtsakten  befindlichen 
Data falsch  sind,  so ist allerdings nicht zu entscheiden, wer  sie gedichtet hat. 
Nun  zu  Bangya. 

5 

Spion  oder  nicht  Spion,  Bangya  konnte  mir  und  meinen Parteigenossen 
nie  gefährlich  werden,  da ich  nie über  meine Parteiangelegenheiten  mit  ihm 
sprach  und  Bangya  selbst  —  wie  er  mir  in  einer  seiner  Rechtfertigungs 
schriften ins  Gedächtniß ruft, — es  durchaus  vermied, die Sprache auf diese 
Angelegenheiten  zu bringen.  Also  Spion oder  nicht  Spion.  Er  konnte  nichts 
10  verrathen,  w en er nichts wußte.  Die Kölner Akten haben dies bestätigt.  Sie 
haben bestätigt,  daß  die  Preußische Polizei, außer den in Deutschland selbst 
gemachten  Zugeständnissen  und  den  in  Deutschland  selbst  saisirten  Docu 
menten,  nichts  von  der  Partei  wußte,  der  ich  angehöre,  und  sich  daher 
genöthigt  sah,  die  albernsten  Ammenmährchen  aufzutischen. 

15 

Aber  Bangya  hat  eine  Brochure  von  Marx  „über  die  Emigranten"  der 

Polizei  verkauft? 

Bangya erfuhr von mir, in Gegenwart anderer Personen, daß Ernst Dronke, 
Friedrich  Engels  und  ich  eine  Publikation  über  die  Londoner  Deutsche 
Emigration  beabsichtigten,  die  in  mehreren  Heften  fortlaufen  sollte.  Er 
20  versicherte einen Buchhändler in Berlin verschaffen zu können. Ich forderte 
ihn  auf,  sich  sofort  umzusehen.  Acht bis  zehn Tage  später  zeigte  er  an,  ein 
Buchhändler,  Namens Eisermann, in Berlin sei erbötig, den Verlag des  ersten 
Hefts  zu  übernehmen,  mit  dem  Vorbehalt,  daß  die  Verfasser  anonym 
blieben,  da  er  sonst  Confiskation  befürchten  müsse.  Ich  ging  darauf  ein, 
stellte  aber  meiner  Seits  die  Bedingung,  daß 'das  Honorar  sofort  bei  Ein 
händigung  des  Manuscripts  gezahlt  werde,  da  ich  die  bei  der  Revue  der 
N. Rh. Zeitung gemachten Erfahrungen nicht wiederholen wolle, und daß das 
Manuscript  nach  Ablieferung  gedruckt  werde.  Ich  reiste  zu  Engels  nach 
Manchester,  wo  die  Brochure  ausgearbeitet  wurde.  In  der  Zwischenzeit 
30  brachte Bangya meiner Frau einen Brief von Berlin, worin Eisermann meine 
Bedingungen  annahm  mit  dem  Bemerken,  der  Verlag  des  zweiten  Hefts 
würde  von  dem Vertrieb  des  ersten abhängen.  Bei meiner Rückkehr  erhielt 
Bangya  das  Manuscript  und  ich  das  Honorar. 

25 

Aber  der  Druck  verzögerte  sich  unter  verschiedenen  plausibeln  Vor-
35  wänden.  Ich  schöpfte  Verdacht.  Nicht  daß  das  Manuscript der Polizei ein 
gehändigt  sei,  damit  sie  es  drucke.  Ich  bin  heute  bereit meine Manuscripte 
dem  Kaiser  von  Rußland  auszuliefern,  wenn  er  seiner  Seits  bereit  ist,  sie 
morgen  zu  drucken.  Umgekehrt.  Was  ich fürchtete war Unterschlagung des 
Manuscripts. 

40 

Die Tagesschreier waren hier angegriffen, natürlich nicht als staatsgefähr 

liche  Revolutionaire,  sondern  als  contrerevolutionaire  Strohwische. 

101 

Karl  Marx 

Mein  Verdacht  bestätigte  sich.  Georg  Weerth,  den  ich  gebeten  hatte,  in 
Berlin  Forschungen  über  Eisermann  anzustellen,  schrieb,  daß  kein  Eiser 
mann  aufzutreiben  sei.  Ich  begab  mich  mit  Drenke  zu  Bangya.  Eisermann 
war  nunmehr bloßer  Geschäftsführer bei Jacob  Collmann.  Da es  mir darum 
zu  thun  war,  Bangya's  Aussagen  schriftlich  zu  haben,  bestand  ich  darauf, 
daß  er  in  meiner  Gegenwart  in  einem  Brief  an  Engels  in  Manchester  seine 
Aussage wiederholte  und Collmann's  Adresse  angebe.  Ich richtete  zugleich 
einige  Zeilen  an  Bruno  Bauer  mit der Bitte,  sich zu  erkundigen,  wer in dem 
mir  von  Bangya  angegebenen  Hause  Collmann's  wohne,  erhielt aber  keine 
Antwort. Der angebliche Buchhändler antwortete auf meine Mahnbriefe, ich 1 o 
habe  keinen  bestimmten  Termin  des  Drucks  contracüich  abgemacht.  Er 
müsse  am besten  wissen, wann  der geeignete  Augenblick gekommen  sei. In 
einem  spätem  Briefe  spielte  er  den  Verletzten.  Schließlich  erklärte  mir 
Bangya,  der  Buchhändler  weigere  sich,  das  Manuscript  zu  drucken,  und 
werde  es  zurückschicken.  Er  selbst  verschwand  nach Paris. 

15 

5 

Die  Berliner  Briefe  und  Bangya's  Briefe,  die  die  ganzen  Verhandlungen 
enthalten,  nebst Rechtfertigungsversuchen  Bangya's befinden sich in meiner 
Hand. 

Aber  warum  machten  mich  die  Verdächtigungen  nicht  irre,  die  die 
Emigration  gegen  Bangya  ausgestreut  hatte?  Eben  weil  ich  die  „Vor-  20 
geschichte"  dieser  Verdächtigungen  kannte.  Ich lasse  diese  Vorgeschichte 
für  jetzt  im  gebührenden  Dunkel. 

Weil ich wußte, daß Bangya als Revolutionsoff icier im ungarischen Kriege 
Rühmliches  geleistet  hat.  Weil  er  mit  Szemere,  den  ich  achte,  in  Cor 
r e s p o n d es und mit General Perczel in freundschaftlicher Beziehung stand. 
WeD  ich  mit  eigenen  Augen  ein  Diplom  sah,  worin  Kossuth  ihn  zu  seinem 
in  partibus  ernennt,  gegengezeichnet  vom  Grafen 
Polizeipräsidenten 
Szirmay,  dem  Vertrauten  Kossuth's,  der  dasselbe  Haus  mit  Bangya  be 
wohnte.  Diese  seine  Stellung bei Kossuth erklärte auch seinen nothwendigen 
Umgang  mit  Polizisten.  Wenn  ich  nicht  irre,  ist  Bangya  noch  in  diesem  30 
Moment  Kossuth's  Agent  in  Paris. 

25 

Die  Ungarischen  Führer mußten ihren Mann  kennen.  Was riskirte  ich im 
Vergleich  mit ihnen?  Nichts,  als  die Unterschlagung  meiner Copie,  von der 
ich  das  Original  in  der  Hand  behielt. 

Später  frag  ich  bei  Buchhändler  Lizius  in  Frankfurt  a.M.  und  andern  35 

Buchhändlern  in  Deutschland  an,  ob  sie  das  Manuscript  drucken  wollten. 
Sie  erklärten es  unter  den gegenwärtigen Verhältnissen für unmöglich. Jetzt 
hat  sich in der letzten Zeit eine Aussicht eröffnet, es in einem nicht deutschen 
Lande  gedruckt  zu  erhalten. 

Nach  diesen  Aufschlüssen,  die  ich  natürlich  nicht  Herrn  Hirsch  gebe,  40 

sondern  meinen  Landsleuten  in  Amerika,  bleibt  nicht  „die  offene  Frage":

London,  Tuesday,  April  12,  1853. 

The  best  thing  perhaps  that  can  be  said  in  favor  of  the  Coalition  Ministry 
is  that it represents  impotency in power at a moment of transition, when not 
the reality,  but only the appearance of government, is possible, with evanes 
cent  old  parties  and  not  yet  consolidated  new  ones.

The  "administration  of  all  the  talents,"  what  has  it  accomplished  during 
its  first quarter's trial? Two readings  of the Jewish Disabilities Bill and three 
of the Canada Clergy Reserves Bin. The latter enables the Canadian Legisla- 1 o 
ture  to  dispose  of a certain portion of the proceeds  of the land-sales hitherto 
reserved  exclusively  for  the benefit of the favorite  churches  of England  and 
Scotland.  When first laid before the House by Lord John Russell, it consisted 
of  three  clauses,  the  third  clause  repealing  the  enactment  by  which  the 
consolidated fund  was  charged  to  supply  the  deficiency,  if  in  any year the  15 
Canada  land-sales  could  not  produce  £9,285.  This  bill  had  been  carried 
through  a  second  reading,  but  on  the  House  going  into  Committee  upon  it 
(March  18)  Lord  John  suddenly  moved  the  withdrawal  of  his  own  third 
clause.  Now,  if the  Canadian Legislature were to  secularize the  Clergy  Re 
serves,  about £10,000  per  annum  would  be  taken  out  of  the pockets of the  20 
British  people  for  the  maintenance  of  a  sect thousands  of  miles  away.  The 
Radical Minister, Sir W. Molesworth who disclaims all ecclesiastical endow 
ments,  appeared himself  to  have  become  a  convert to  Lord John's  doctrine 
"that  British  Colonies  were  not  to  be  freed  from  the  incubus  of  the  Estab 
lished Church,  except at the cost and risk of the British people at home." 

25 

Three  Radical  resolutions  were  proposed  during  the  first  quarter's  trial. 
Mr. Collier  moved  the  abolition  of  the  Ecclesiastical  Courts,  Mr. Williams 

104 

Achievements  of  the  Ministry

the extension of the legacy and probate-duty to real property, and Mr. Hume 
the  extinction  of  all  "strictly  protective"  duties.  The  Ministry,  of  course, 
opposed  all  these  "sweeping"  reforms.  But the  Coalition Ministry opposes 
them  in  quite  a  different  manner  from  the  Tories.  The  latter  resolutely 
announced  their  decision to  resist the  "encroachments of Democracy." The 
former  actually  do  the  same,  but  do  it  under  the  pretence  of  attending  to 
reform  measures  more  carefully.  They  live  on  reforms,  as  the  others lived 
on  abuses.  Apparently  eagerly  engaged  in  reforms  they  have  contrived  a 
perfect  system  of  postponing  them.  One  day  it  is  "advisable  to  await  the 
result of an impending inquiry." Then "a Commission has just been appoint 
ed  and  nothing can be  done  till it has given its decisions." Again "the object 
is  just  under  the  consideration  of  the  Government,"  who  expect  not  to  be 
interrupted  in  their  lucubrations.  Next,  "the  subject deserves  the  attention 
of  the  House—when  a  fitting  opportunity  shall  occur."  "The  proper  season 
15  has  not  yet  arrived."  "The  time  is  not  far  distant when  something must be 
done."  Particular  measures  must  be  postponed  in  order  to  readjust  entire 
systems, or entire  systems must be conserved in order to carry out particular 
measures.  The  "policy  of  abstention"  proclaimed  on  the  Eastern  question 
is  also  the  Ministerial  policy  at  home. 

10 

20 

When Lord John Russell first announced the programme of the Coalition 
Ministry,  and when it was received amid general consternation, his adherents 
exclaimed,  "We must have  something to be enthusiastic at. Public education 
shall  be  the  thing.  Our  Russell  is  breeding  a  wonderful  Education  scheme. 
You  will  hear  of  it." 

25 

Now  we  have  heard  of  it.  It  was  on  the  4th  of  April  that Russell  gave  a 
general  description  of  this  intended  Educational  Reform.  Its  principal  fea 
tures  consist  in  enabling  the  municipal  councils  to  levy  a  local  rate for  the 
assistance  of  existing schools  in  which  the  Church of  England doctrines  are 
required  to  be  taught.  As  to  the  Universities,  those pet-children of the  State 
30  Church,  those  chief  opponents  to  every reform,  Lord John hopes  "that the 
Universities  will  reform  themselves."  The  malversation  of  the  charities 
destined  for  educational  establishments  is  notorious.  Their  value  may  be 
guessed from the following:  "There are 24 of £2,000 a year and under £3,000, 
10 of £3,000 and under £4,000,4 of £4,000 and under £5,000,  2 of £5,000 and 
35  under  £6,000,  3  of  £8,000  and  under  £9,000,  and  single  ones  of  £10,000, 
£15,000, £20,000, £29,000, £30,000 and £35,000 a year each." It needs no great 
sagacity  to  conceive  why  the  oligarchs  living  on  the  malversation  of  these 
funds  are  very  cautions  in  dealing  with  them.  Russell proposes:  "Charities 
are  to  be  examined  into,  those  under  £30  per  annum  in the  County Courts, 
those  above by the  Master of  the Rolls. But no suit in either of those Courts 
is  to  be  instigated  without  the  permission  of  a  Committee  of  the  Council 

40 

105 

Karl  Marx 

appointed  for  the  purpose."  The  permission  of  a  committee  is  necessary 
to  institute  a  suit  in  the  Imperial  Courts  to  redress  the  plunder  of  the 
charities  originally  destined  for  the  education  of  the  people.  A permission! 
But  Russell,  even  with  this  reservation,  feels  not  quite  sure.  He  adds:  "If 
the  administration  of  a  school  is  found  to  be  corrupt,  nobody  but  the 
Committee  of  Council  shall  be  allowed  to  interfere." 

5 

This  is  a  true  Reform  in  the  old  English  sense  of  the  word.  It  neither 
creates  anything  new,  nor  abolishes  anything  old.  It  aims  at  conserving 
the  old  system,  by  giving  it  a  more  reasonable  form  and  teaching  it,  so 
to  say,  new  manners.  This  is  the  mystery  of  the  "hereditary  wisdom"  of  10 
in  making  abuses 
legislation.  It  simply  consists 
English  oligarchical 
hereditary,  by  refreshing  them,  as  it  were,  from  time  to  time,  by  an 
infusion  of  new  blood. 

If  everybody  must  confess  that  the  Jewish  Disabilities  Bill  was  a  little 
attempt  at  establishing  religious  tolerance,  the  Canada  Reserves  Bill  a  15 
little  attempt  at  granting  Colonial  Self-Government,  the  Education  Bill 
a  little  attempt  at  avoiding  public  education,  Gladstone's  financial  scheme 
is,  undoubtedly,  a  mighty little  attempt  at  dealing  with  that  giant  monster, 
the  National  Debt  of  Great  Britain. 

20 

On the 8th of April, before the promulgation of the budget, Mr. Gladstone 
laid  before  the  House  of  Commons  a  statement  of  several  resolutions 
dealing  with  the  public  debt,  and,  before  this  statement  had  been  made, 
The  Morning  Chronicle  had  made  a  special  announcement  that  resolutions 
of  the  utmost  importance  were  about to  be  proposed,  "heralded  by  rumors 
of  great  interest  and  magnitude."  The  funds  rose  on  this  rumor.  There  25 
was  an  impression  that  Gladstone  was  going  to  pay  off  the  National 
Debt;  but  on  the  8th  of  April,  the  moment  the  Committee  met  for 
deliberation  on  these  resolutions,  Mr. Gladstone  suddenly  altered  them, 
and  in  such  a  manner  as  to  divest  them both  of  "magnitude  and  interest." 
Now,  let  us  ask,  with  Mr. Disraeli,  "what was  all  this  pother  about?" 

30 

The  ultimate  aim  of  Mr. Gladstone's  propositions,  as  stated  by  himself, 
was  to  reduce  the  interest  on  the  public  stocks  to  the  standard  rate  of 
2V2 per  cent.  Now,  in the  years  1822-23-24-25,  1830-31,  1844-45, reduc 
tions  were  made  from  5  per  cent,  to  4V2  per  cent.,  from  4ll2  to  4 per  cent., 
from  4  to  3V2  per  c e n t,  from  3V2  to  3'per  cent,  respectively.  Why  35 
should  there  not be  a reduction from  3  per cent,  to  2V2 per c e n t? Mr. Glad 
stone's  proposals  are  as  follows: 

Firstly.  With  respect  to  various  stocks  amounting  to  £9,500,000,  and 
chiefly  connected  with  the  old  South  Sea  bubble,  to  bring  them  under one 
single denomination, and to reduce them compulsorily from 3 to 23U per cent.  40 
This  would  give  a  permanent  annual  saving  approaching  to  £25,000.  The 

106 

Achievements  of  the  Ministry 

invention  of  a  new  common  name  for  various  stocks,  and  the  saving  of 
£25,000  on  an  annual  expense  of £30,000,000,  is  certainly not to be boasted 
of. 

Secondly.  He  proposes the issue of a new financial paper called Exchequer 
5  Bonds, not exceeding in amount £30,000,000, transferable by simple delivery 
without costs of  any kind, bearing interest at 23/4 per cent,  up to Sept.  1,1864, 
and  then 2V2 per cent,  up  to  Sept. 1,  1894.  Now this  is  merely the  creation 
of  a  new  financial  instrument  limited  in  its  use by the  wants  of the  monied 
and  mercantile  classes.  But how can he keep £18,000,000 of Exchequer Bills 
10  at  IV2 per  cent,  in circulation, with Exchequer Bonds at 272 per cent.? And 
is  it not a loss to the country to pay  1  per cent,  more upon Exchequer Bonds 
than  upon  Exchequer  Bills?  Be  this  as  it  may,  this  second  proposition  has 
at  least  nothing  to  do  with  the  reduction  of  the  public  debt. 

Thirdly  and lastly.  We  come  to  the  chief  object,  the  only  important point 
15  of  Gladstone's  resolutions,  to  the  3  per  cent.  Consols  and  the  3  per cent. 
Reduced,  amounting  together  to  a  capital of nearly £500,000,000.  HicRhodus 
hie  salta! As  there  exists  a Parliamentary  provision forbidding  these  stocks 
to  be  reduced  compulsorily,  except on  twelve months  notice,  Mr.  Gladstone 
chooses  the  system  of voluntary commutation, offering various  alternatives 
to  the  holders  of  the  3  per cent.  Stocks for exchanging them  at option with 
other  stocks  to  be created under his resolutions. They are to have the option 
of  exchanging  every  £100  of  the  3  per  cent.  Stock  in  one  of  the  following 
ways: 

20 

1. They  may  exchange  every £100  of 3  per  cent.  Stock for  an Exchequer 
25  Bond  of  the  like  amount,  bearing  interest  at  the  rate  of  23/4  per  cent,  until 
1864,  and  then  at  the  rate  of  272  per  cent,  until  1894.  If  the  whole  of  the 
£30,000,000  Exchequer  Bonds  at  2V2  per  cent,  should  thus  replace 
£30,000,000  of  3  per  cent,  there  would  be  a  saving  in  the  first  ten  years  of 
£75,000,  and  after  the  first  ten  years  of  £150,000-together  £225,000;  but 
30  Government  would  be  bound  to  repay the whole of the £30,000,000. In any 

case  this  is  not  a  proposition  to  deal  largely  with  the  public  debt. 

2. The  second  proposal  is,  that the  holders  of  stock  shall obtain for every 
£100 in 3 per cent.  £82  10s.  in new  stock at 3l/2 per cent., which shall be paid 
at the rate of 3V2 per cent, until the 5th January, 1894. The result of this would 
35  be to give á present income to the persons accepting the 3V2 per cent, stock 
of  £2  17s.  9d.,  instead  of £3.  Here  then  is  a reduction of 2s.  3d.  annually in 
every  £100.  If  the  £500,000,000  were  all  converted  upon  this  proposal,  the 
result  would  be  that  instead  of  paying  as  at present £15,000,000  a-year,  the 
nation  would  only  pay  £14,437,500,  and  this  would  be  a  gain  of  £562,500 
a-year. But for this  small saving of £562,500 Parliament would tie up its hands 
for half  a century  and guaranty  a higher  interest  than  24/s  per cent,  at a time 

40 

107 

Karl  Marx 

of  transition  and of utter uncertainty as to the future standard rate of interest. 
On the  other  hand,  one  thing  at least would be  gained for Mr. Gladstone. At 
the  expiration of 40 years,  he would not be troubled with a 3 per cent,  stock, 
being  defended,  as  now,  by  a  twelve-months'  notice.  He  would  only  have 
to  deal  with  the  3 ' /2  per cent,  stock redeemable  at par by Parliament.  Glad- 
stone  proposes  not to  fix  any  limit  on his  3V2  per  cent,  stock. 

5 

3.  The  third  proposal  is  that the  holders  of every £100 3  per cent,  should 
receive  £110 in  a new  stock of  2'/2 per  cent,  until  1894. When Mr. Gladstone 
introduced  his  plan  in  the  House  of  Commons  on the  8th April,  he  had not 
limited  the  amount  (the  2ll2 per  cents.) to be  issued.  But Mr. Disraeli having  10 
pointed  out  that,  contrasting  this  proposal  with  the  two  other  modes 
proposed,  every man in his  senses would choose the conversion of £100 into 
2V2  per  cents.,  and  that  by  the  conversion  of  the  whole  £500,000,000  3  per 
cents,  into  the  new  stock,  the  country would gain on one side £1,250,000 per 
annum,  but  be  saddled  on  the  other  side  with  an  addition  to  the  capital of  15 
the  public  debt  of  £50,000,000.  Mr. Gladstone  on  the  following  day  altered 
this proposition and proposed to limit this new 2V2  stock to £30,000,000.  By 
this  alteration  the  whole  of  the  third  proposal  loses  its  significance  with 
respect  to  the  public debt. The  capital of that debt would be augmented only 
by £3,000,000. 

20 

Here  you have  "one of the most important and gigantic financial proposals 
that  has  ever  been  brought  forward."  There  exists  perhaps  in  general  no 
greater humbug than the so-called Finance. The most simple operations on the 
Budget  and the  Public  Debt  are  clothed by  the  adepts  of that occult  science 
in  an  abstruse  terminology,  concealing  the  trivial  manoeuvers  of  creating  25 
various  denominations  of  Stocks—the  commutation  of  old  stocks  into  new 
ones,  the  diminishing  the  interest and raising the nominal capital, the raising 
the  interest  and  reducing  the  capital,  the  installing  of  premiums,  of  bonus, 
priority-shares, the distinctions between redeemable and irredeemable annu 
ities,  the  artificial  graduation  in  the  facility  of  transferring  the  various  de-  30 
scriptions  of  paper—in  a  manner  which  quite  bamboozles  the  public  with 
these  detestable  stock-jobbing  scholastics  and  frightful  complexity  of  de 
tails, while the usurers obtain with every such new  scheme  an eagerly  seized 
opportunity for  developing their mischievous and predatory activity.  On the 
other  hand,  the  political  economist  finds  in  all  this  apparent  intricacy  of  35 
commutations,  permutations  and  combinations,  not  so  much  a  matter  of 
financial policy as  a simple question of arithmetic or of mere phraseology. 

Mr. Gladstone  is  certainly  a  master  in this  sort of financial alchymy,  and 
his  scheme cannot be better characterized, than in the words of Mr. Disraeli: 
"More  complicated  and  ingenious  machinery,  to produce  so  slight a result,  40 
appeared  to  him  never  to  have  been  devised  by  the  subtlety  and  genius  of 

108 

Achievements  of  the  Ministry 

5 

10 

the  most  skilful  casuist.  In  St. Thomas  Aquinas  there  was  a  chapter  that 
speculated  upon the  question  of  how  many  angels  could  dance  on the  point 
of  a  needle.  It  was  one  of  the  rarest  productions  of  human  genius;  and  he 
recognised  in  these  resolutions  something  of  that  master  mind." 

You will remember  that I  stated  that the  end  of Mr. Gladstone's  plan was 
the establishment of a "normal" 2l/2 per cent,  stock. Now, in order to achieve 
this end, he creates a very limited  2ll2 per cent, stock and an unlimited 3 72 per 
cent,  stock.  In  order  to  create  his  small  272  per cent,  stock,  he  reduces  the 
interest  by  V2 per cent.,  and gives  on the other hand a bonus  of  10 per cent. 
for  the  purpose  of  accomphshing  that  reduction.  In  order  to  rid himself  of 
the difficulty of the  3 per cent., being "defended" by a twelve-months notice, 
he  prefers  legislating  for  the  40  years  next  to  come,  and  in  conclusion  he 
would,  if  successful,  bereave  two  generations  of  all  possible  fortunate 
chances  in  their  financial  affairs. 

15 

The  position  of  the  Coalition  Ministry  in  the  House, is clearly  shown by 
the  statistics  of votes.  On the  question of  Maynooth in a large House, it had 
but the narrow majority of 30.  On the Jewish Disabilities bill, (not yet carried 
through the third reading,) in a House of 439 members, its majority amounted 
not  even  to  30  votes.  In  the  Canada  Reserves  bill,  when  Russell  withdrew 
20  his  own third clause,  the  Ministers  were  saved by the Tories from their own 
supporters.  Their  majority  was  almost  entirely  supplied  from  the  benches 
of  the  Conservatives. 

I shall not dwell on the internal dissensions of the Cabinet, which appeared 
in  the  debates  on  the  Canada  bill,  in  the  hot  controversy  of the  ministerial 
25  papers with regard  to the  Income-Tax, and above all, in their foreign policy. 
There  is  not  one  single  question  to  which  the  Coalition-Ministry  might not 
answer,  as  did  Gaysa,  the  Magyar  king,  who,  after  having  been  converted 
to Christianity, continued, notwithstanding, to observe the rites of his ancient 
superstition.  When questioned to which of the two faiths  he really belonged, 

30  he  replied:  "I  am  rich  enough  to  belong to  two  sorts  of faith."

The  People's  Paper. 
Nr. 50,  16. April  1853 

The  New Financial Juggle; 
or Gladstone and the Pennies. 

Our readers know, to their cost, and have learned, to the tune of their pockets, 
that  an  old  financial  juggle  has  imposed  a National  Debt of  £800,000,000  on 
the  people's  shoulders.  That  Debt  was  chiefly  contracted  to  prevent  the 
liberation of  the  American colonies, and to counteract the French Revolution 
of  the  last  century.  The  influence  of  the  increase  of  the  National  Debt  on 
the increase  of the national expenditure,  may be gathered from the following 
tabular  analysis:— 

1.  National  Debt.

The  People  well  know,  from  personal  pocket-experience,  what  is  the 
weight of taxation  resulting from the  National Debt—but many are not aware 
of the peculiar forms under which this Debt has been contracted, and actually 
exists.  The  "State,"  that jointocracy  of coalesced land and money mongers, 
wants  money  for  the  purpose  of  home  and  foreign  oppression.  It  borrows 
15  money  of  capitalists  and  usurers,  and  in  return  gives  them  a  bit  of  paper, 
pledging  itself  to  pay  them  so  much  money  in  the  shape  of  interest for each 
£100  they  lend.  The  means  of  paying  this  money  it  tears  from the  working 
classes  through  the  means  of  taxation—so  that  the  people  are  the  security 
for  their  oppressors  to the men who lend them the  money to cut the people's 
throats.  This  money  has  been  borrowed  as  a  debt  under  various  de­
nominations—sometimes  to  pay  3  per  cent.,  372  per  cent.,  4  per  cent.,  etc., 
and  according to that percentage  and other accidents the funds have various 
denominations,  as  the  3  per  cents.,  etc. 

20 

Every  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer,  with  the  exception  of  the  Whigs,  as 
25  not only the working classes, but the manufacturers and landlords also, have 
to  pay  a  portion  of  this  interest,  and  wish  to  pay  as  little  as  possible,  tries 
accordingly, in  some  way  or other, to alleviate the pressure of this incubus. 

30 

On the  8th of  April,  before  the  Budget of  the present Ministry was brought 
forward,  Mr.  Gladstone  laid  before  the  House  a  statement of  several resolu-
tions  dealing with the Public Debt—and before this  statement had been made 
the  "Morning  Chronicle"  announced  that  resolutions  of  the  utmost  im­
portance  were  to  be  proposed,  "heralded  by  rumours  of  great  interest  and 
magnitude."  The  funds  rose  on these rumours;  there was  an impression that 
Gladstone  was  going  to  pay  off  the  National  Debt.  Now,  "what  was  all  this 

35  bother about?" 

The  ultimate  aim  of  Mr. Gladstone's  proposals,  as  stated  by  himself,  was 
to  reduce  the  interest  on  the  various  public  stocks  to  2V2 per  cent.  Now,  in 
the  years  1822-3,  1824-5,1830-1,  1844-5,  there  had been reductions, from 
5  per  cent,  to  472,  from 472  to 4, from 4 to  372» from 3 7Σ to  3, respectively. 

40  Why  should  there  not  be  a  reduction  from  3  to  272? 

111 

Karl  Marx 

Now,  let  us  see  in  what  manner  Mr. Gladstone  proposes  to  achieve  this 

end. 

Firstly.  He  proposes  with  respect 

to  certain  stocks  amounting  to 
£9,500,000,  chiefly connected  with the  old  South  Sea Bubble,  to bring them 
under one  single denomination,  and to reduce them compulsorily from 3 per 
cent,  to  23/4  per  cent.  This  gives  a permanent annual  saving approaching to 
£25,000.  The  invention  of  a  new  general  name  of  various  stocks,  and  the 
saving  of  £25,000  on  an  annual  expense  £30,000,000,  does  not  merit  any 
particular  admiration. 

5 

10 

Secondly.  He proposes  to  issue  a new financial paper,  called  Exchequer- 
Bonds,  not  exceeding  the  amount  of  £30,000,000,  transferable  by  simple 
delivery, without cost of  any kind, bearing interest at 23/4 per cent., up to the 
1st  of  September,  1864,  and  then  2V2  per  cent,  up  to  the  1st of  September, 
1894.  Now  this  is  simply  the  creation  of  a new  financial  instrument for the 
comfort  of  the  monied  and  mercantile  class.  He  says  "without cost,"  that  15 
is,  without  cost  to  the  City  Merchant.  At  the  present  moment  there  are 
£18,000,000 of Exchequer Bills  at  IV2 per cent.  Is it not a loss to the country 
to pay  1  per cent,  more upon the  Exchequer Bonds than upon the Exchequer 
Bills?  At  all  events  the  second  proposition  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  re 
duction of the National Debt. The Exchequer Bills can circulate only in Great 
Britain,  but  the  Exchequer  Bonds  are  transferable  as  common  Bills,  there 
fore  it  is  a  mere  measure  of Convenience to  the  City  Merchants,  for which 
the  people  pay  a  high  price. 

20 

Now,  finally,  we  come  to  the  only  important  matter—to  the  3  per  cent, 
consols,  and  the  "3  per  cent,  reduced,"  amounting  together  to  a capital  of  25 
nearly  £500,000,000.  As  there  exists  a  Parliamentary  provision  forbidding 
these  stocks  to  be  reduced  compulsorily,  except  on  twelve  months  notice, 
Mr. Gladstone  chooses  the  system  of voluntary commutation, offering vari 
ous  alternatives  to  the  holders  of  the  3  per  cent,  stock for  exchanging them 
at option with other  stocks  to be  created under his resolutions.  The  holders  30 
of the  3  per cent,  stocks  shall have the option of exchanging each £100 3 per 
cent,  in  one  of  the  three  following  forms:— 

1.—Semi-Exchange,  every £100  of  the  3 per cent,  with an Exchequer bond 
for  the  like  amount  carrying  interest  at the  rate  of  £2  15 s.  until  1864,  and 
then  at  the  rate  of  £2  10s.  until  1894.  If  the  whole  of  the  £30,000,000  of  35 
Exchequer bonds  at 272 per  cent,  replaced £30,000,000 of 3 per cents., there 
would be  a saving in the first ten years of £75,000; and after the first ten years 
of £150,000; together £225,000; but the  Government would be bound to repay 
the whole of the £30,000,000,  after forty years.  In no respect is this a proposi 
tion dealing largely, or even at all, with the National Debt. For what is a saving  40 
of  £225,000  in  an  annual  expense  of  £30,000,000? 

112 

The  New  Financial  Juggle;  or  Gladstone  and  the  Pennies 

2.—The  second  proposal is,  that the  holders  of stock shall retain for every 
£100 in 3  per  cents.,  £82  10s. in new  stock of 3V2 Per cent., which would be 
paid at the rate of £3  10s.  per cent,  until the 5th of January,  1894. The result 
of that would be to  give a present income to the persons accepting the 3V2 per 
5  cent,  stock, of £2  17s.  9d., instead  of £3—reduction of 2s.  3d.  on the interest 
of  every  £100.  If  the  £500,000,000  were  all  converted  under  this  proposal, 
the  result  would  be  that,  instead  of  paying,  as  at  present,  £15,000,000  per 
annum,  the  nation  would  only  pay  £14,437,500,  and this would be  a gain of 
£562,500  a  year.  But  for  this  saving of £500,000 Parliament would tie up  its 
10  hands for half a century, and grant higher interest than 2 four-fifths per cent, 
at  a  time  of  transition  and  of utter insecurity  of  every rate  of interest!  One 
thing,  however,  would  be  gained  for  Gladstone—at  the  expiration  of  forty 
years there would be, in the place of the 3 per cent, stock being now defended 
by twelve  months'  notice,  a  2>ll2 per  cent,  stock redeemable  at par by parlia-

15  ment.  Gladstone proposes not to fix any limit on that 3 ' /2 per cent,  stock. 

3.—The  third proposal  is,  that  the  holders  of  every £100  3  per cent,  shall 
receive £110 in a new  stock of  2'/2 per  cent,  until  1894. When Mr. Gladstone 
first  introduced  his  plan  in  the  House  of Commons,  on the  8th of  April,  he 
had  not  limited  the  amount  of  the  new  2ll2  per  cent,  to  be  issued,  but 
20  Mr. Disraeli  having  pointed  out that, contrasting this proposal with the two 
other  ones,  every  man  in  his  senses  would  choose  the  conversion  of  £100 
3  per  cent,  into  £110  2V2  per  cent.;  and  that  by  the  conversion  of  the 
£500,000,000  3  per  cent,  into  the  new  stock,  the  nation  would  gain  on  one 
side, £1,250,000 per  annum, but be  saddled on the other hand with an addition 
to  the  Public  Debt  of  £50,000,000,  Mr. Gladstone,  on  the  following  day, 
altered his  proposition,  and proposed  to  limit the  new  2V2 per  cent,  stock to 
£30,000,000.  By  this  limitation,  his  proposal  loses  almost  all  effect  on  the 
great  stock of the Public Debt,  and augments its capital only by £3,000,000.

Now you know "one of the most important and gigantic financial proposals 
that  ever  has  been brought forward."  There  exists,  perhaps,  in general, no 
greater humbug  than  the  so-called  finance.  The  simplest  operations relating 
to  the  Budget  and  the  Public Debt,  are  clothed by the adepts of that "occult 
science"  in abstruse terminology, concealing the trivial manœuvres of creat 
ing various  denominations  of  stocks, the commutation of old  stocks for new 
35  ones, the dimmishing the interest, and raising the nominal capital—the raising 
the  interest  and  reducing  the  capital,  the  instalment of premiums, bonuses, 
priority  shares—the  distinction  between redeemable and irredeemable  annu 
ities—the  artificial  graduation  in  the  facility  of  transferring  the  various 
papers—in  such  a manner  that the  public understanding is quite bamboozled 
40  by  these  detestable  stock-jobbing  scholastics  and  the  frightful  complexity 
in  details;  while  with every  such new financial operation the  usurers  obtain 

113 

Karl  Marx 

an  eagerly-seized  opportunity  for  developing  their  mischievous  and preda 
tory  activity.  Mr. Gladstone  is,  without  any  doubt,  a  master in  this  sort of 
financial  alchemy,  and  this  proposal  cannot be  better  characterised  than by 
the  words  of  Mr. Disraeli:— 

"More  complicated  and ingenious machinery to produce so  slight a result, 
appeared  to  him  never  to  have  been  devised  by  the  subtlety  and  genius  of 
the  most  skilful  casuist.  In  Saint  Thomas  Aquinas  there was  a chapter  that 
speculated  upon the  question  of  how  many  angels  could  dance  on  the  point 
of  a  needle.  It  was  one  of  the  rarest productions  of  human  genius;  and  he 
recognised  in these  resolutions  something  of  that  master  mind."

You will remember that we have  stated that the ultimate end of Gladstone's 
plan was the  establishment of  a "normal"  2V2 per cent.  fund.  Now, in order 
to  achieve  this  end,  he  creates  a  very  limited  2V2  per  cent,  fund,  and  an 
illimited 3V2 per cent,  stock. In order to create his limited 2V2 per cent,  stock, 
he  reduces  the  interest  by  a  half  per  cent.,  and  augments  the  capital  by  a  15 
bonus  of  10 per  cent.  In order to rid himself of the difficulty of all legislation 
on  the  3  per  cents,  being  defended  by  twelve  months'  notice,  he  prefers 
legislating for  half  a century to  come; in conclusion, he would, if  successful, 
cut  off  all  chance  of  financial  liberation for  half  a century from the  British 
people. 

20 

Every  one  will  confess,  that  if  the  Jewish  Disabilities  Bill  was  a  little 
attempt at establishing religious  tolerance—the  Canada Reserves  Bill  a little 
attempt  at  granting  colonial  self-government—the  Education  Resolution  a 
little  attempt  at  avoiding  National  Education—Gladstone's  financial  scheme 
is a mighty little attempt at dealing with that giant-monster, the National Debt 25 
of  Britain.

Feargus  O'Connor—Ministerial  Defeats— 
The  Budget. 

Correspondence  of  The  N.Y.Tribune. 

London,  Tuesday,  April  19,  1853. 

5  The  Commission  which  met  last week  to examine into  the  state  of mind of 
Feargus  O'Connor, late  M.P.  for Nottingham, returned the following verdict: 
"We  find  that Mr. Feargus  O'Connor has been insane  since the  10th of June, 
1852,  without  any  lucid  intervals." 

As  a  political  character  O'Connor  had  outlived  himself  already  in  1848. 
10  His  strength  was  broken,  his  mission  fulfilled,  and  unable  to  master  the 
proletarian  movement  organised  by  himself,  he  had  grown  almost  a 
hindrance  to  it.  If  historical  impartiality  oblige  me  not  to  conceal  this  cir 
cumstance,  it  also  obliges  me  in  justice  to  the fallen man,  to lay before  the 
same  public,  the  judgment  given  on  O'Connor,  by  Ernest  Jones,  in  The 

15  People's  Paper: 

"Here  was  a  man  who  broke  away  from  rank,  wealth,  and  station;  who 
threw  up  a lucrative  and  successful practice; who  dissipated  a large fortune, 
not  in  private  self-denial,  but  in  political  self-sacrifice;  who  made  himself 
an  eternal  exile  from  his  own  country,  where  he  owned  broad  acres  and 
20 represented one of its largest Counties ; who was hated by his family because 
he  loved  the  human race;  whose  every  act  was  devotion to  the  people;  and 
who  ends  almost  destitute  after  a  career  of  unexampled  l a b o r . . ..  There  is 
his  life.  Now  look  at  his  work:  At  a  time  of  utter  prostration,  of  disunion, 
doubt  and  misery, he  gathered  the  millions  of  this  country together,  as  men 
25  had never yet been gathered.  O'Connell rallied the Irish, but it was with the 
help  of  the  priests;  Mazzini roused  the  Italians, but nobles and traders were 
on his  side;  Kossuth gathered the  Hungarians, but Senates and armies were 

115 

Karl  Marx 

at  his  back;  and  both  the  Hungarians  and  Italians  were  burning  against  a 
foreign conqueror.  But O'Connor, without noble, priest or trader, rallied and 
upheld  one  downtrodden  class  against  them  all!  without  even  the  leverage 
of  national  feeling to  unite  them!  La Fayette  had the  merchants,  Lamartine 
had the  shopkeepers.  O'Connor had the people!  But the people in the nine- 
teenth century,  in Constitutional  England,  are  the weakest of  all.  He taught 
them  how  to  become  the  strongest."

Last week was  a week  of  defeats  for  the  Coalition Cabinet.  It met for the 
first  time  with  a  Coalition  Opposition.  On  Tuesday  the  12th  inst.,  Mr. Butt 
moved to maintain for the Irish soldiers the Asylum of Kilmainham Hospital. 
The  Secretary  at  War  opposed  the  motion;  but  it  was  carried  against  the 
Government by  198 against  131. On this occasion it was beaten by a Coalition 
of  the  Irish  Brigade  with  the  Conservative  Opposition.  On  the  following 
Thursday  it  was  defeated  by  a  Coalition  of  the  Conservatives  and  the 
Manchester  school.  Mr. Milner  Gibson having brought in his yearly motion  15 
for  the  abolition of the  "Taxes  on  Knowledge," the repeal of the Advertise 
ment  Duty  was  voted,  notwithstanding  the  protestations  of  Gladstone, 
Russell  and  Sidney.  They  lost,  by  200  against  169.  Bright,  Gibson  and 
MacGregor voted side by side with Disraeli, Pakington, etc., and Mr. Cobden 
made the formal declaration,  "that he accepted the assistance of Mr. Disraeli  20 
and  his  friends with all his heart."  But by far the greatest defeat the  Govern 
ment has  sustained was  brought upon it,  not by  a division  in the House, but 
by  an  act  of  its  own. 

Of  the  Kossuth rocket  affair full particulars will already have reached the 
readers  of  The  Tribune,  but  in  order  to  prove  that  the  whole  of  it  was  a  25 
premeditated affair between Palmerston and the Foreign Powers, it is merely 
necessary  to  state  what his  own official journal,  The Morning Post,  contains 
with  regard  to  the  occurrence: 

"The promptitude  and vigilance of the course adopted by Government will 
give  confidence  to  those  foreign  powers  who  have  doubted the  efficacy  of  30 
our  laws  in  repressing  mischief  among  our  troublesome  guests." 

This business will have its serious consequences for the Coalition Ministry. 
Already,  and  this  is  of great  significance,  it has  demasked  old Palmerston's 
revolutionary  dandyism.  Even  his  most  credulous  but honest  admirer,  The 
Morning  Advertiser,  openly  disavows  him.  Palmerston's  star  began to  pale 
at the time when he bestowed  his  sympathies on the hero of the 2d December 
and  of  the  plain of  Satory;  it has  vanished,  since he became  professedly  an 
"Austrian  Minister."  But,  the  mission of the  Coalition Ministry  is  precisely 
the  demoralization  of  all  the  current  talents  and  renommées  of  the  old 
Oligarchy.  And this  problem  it is  resolving with an admirable perseverance.  40 
Should  Palmerston's  Ministry  survive  this  catastrophe, then he  may indeed, 

35 

116 

Feargus  O'Connor—Ministerial  Defeats—The  Budget 

with a slight alteration of the  saying of Francis I, jocosely proclaim "Nothing 
is  lost  except  honor." 

I  come  now  to  the  event  of  the  day—Mr. Gladstone's budget—laid before 
the House of Commons in its yesterday's  sitting, in a speech which occupied 
5  no  less  than  five  hours.  It  is  a  Coalition-Budget,  elaborated  in  an  en 

cyclopedical  manner,  exceedingly  fitted  for  an  article  in  Ersch  &  Gruber's 
voluminous  Dictionary  of  Arts  and  Sciences.  You  know  that  the  era  of 
encyclopedists  arrives  always  when  facts  have  become  bulky,  and  genius 
remains  proportionably  small. 

10 

In every budget the principal question is the relation between income and 
expenditure, the balance in the  shape of a surplus  or a deficiency prescribing 
the  general  conditions  of  either  a relaxation or  an increase to be established 
in the taxation of the country.  Mr. Disraeli had estimated the revenue for the 
year  1852-53  at  £52,325,000,  and  the  expenditure  at  £51,163,000.  Now, 
15  Mr. Gladstone informs us that the actual revenue has been £53,089,000, and 
the real expenditure only £50,782,000. These features  show an actual surplus 
of  income  over  expenditure  amounting  to  £2,460,000.  Thus  far,  Mr. Glad 
stone would  seem to have improved Mr. Disraeli. The latter could only boast 
of  a  surplus  of  £1,600,000;  Gladstone  comes  with  a  saving  of  £2,460,000. 
20  Unfortunately,  unlike  Disraeli's  surplus,  that  of  Mr. Gladstone,  on  nearer 
examination,  dwindles  down  to  the  moderate  amount  of  £700,000,  the 
millions  having  already  found  their  way  out  of  his  pocket  by  various  votes 
of  the  House  of  Commons  and  other  extraordinary  expenditure;  and,  as 
Mr. Gladstone  cautiously  adds:  "It  must  be  remembered that £220,000, out 
25  of  the  £700,000,  is  derived  from  occasional  and  not  permanent  sources  of 
income." Then, the only basis of operations left to Mr. Gladstone is a surplus 
of  £480,000.  Accordingly  any  proposed  remission  of  old  taxes  beyond  this 
amount  has  to  be  balanced  by  the  imposition  of  new  ones. 

30 

Mr.Gladstone  opened  his  speech  with  the  "question  brûlante"  oí  the 
Income  Tax.  He  said  that  it  was  possible  to  part  with  that  tax at once, but 
that  the  Government were  not prepared  to  recommend  its  immediate  aban 
donment.  The first thing to which he called attention was, that "we draw from 
this tax £5,500,000. " Next he attempted a "brilliant" vindication of the effects 
of this  tax,  on the  history  of  which he expended a good deal of breath.  "The 
Income  Tax"  he remarked,  "has  served in a time of vital  struggle  to  enable 
you  to  raise  the  income  of  the  country  above  its  expenditure  for  war  and 
civil  government  . ..  If  you  do  not  destroy  the  efficacy  of  this  engine,  it 
affords  you  the  means,  should  unhappily  hostilities  again  break  out,  of  at 
once  raising  your  army  to  300,000  men,  and  your  fleet  to  100,000,  with  all 
40  your  establishments  in  proportion."  Further  Mr. Gladstone  observed,  that 
the  Income  Tax  had  not  only  served  in  carrying  on  the  Anti-Jacobin  war, 

35 

117 

Karl  Marx 

but  also  the  free  trade  policy  of  Sir  Robert  Peel.  After  this  apologetic  in 
troduction we  are  suddenly  startled  by  the  announcement that  "the  Income 
Tax  is  full  of  irregularities."  In  fact,  Mr. Gladstone  admits,  that in order to 
preserve  the  tax,  it  must  be  reconstructed  so  as  to  avoid  its  present  in 
equalities  ;  but  that  in  order  to  remove  these  inequalities,  you  must  break  up  5 
the whole  set.  Strangely contradicting himself, he is afterwards at great pains 
to  show that there  exists  no  such inequalities at all, and that they are merely 
imaginary.  As to the question of realized  and precarious incomes, he reduces 
it to  a question of  "land and of trade,"  and tries to persuade people, through 
some  awkward  calculations,  that land actually pays  9d.  in the pound, while  10 
trade  only  pays  Id.  He  then  adds:  "that the  assessment  on land  and  houses 
does  not  depend  on the  returns  of the  owners,  whereas  in trade  the  returns 
of  income  are  made  by  the  holders  themselves,  and  in  many  cases  in  a 
fraudulent manner."  With regard  to fundholders, Mr. Gladstone  asserts that 
to  tax  the  capitalised value of their income, would be  a gross breach of the  15 
public faith. Any distinction, in short, between realized or precarious income, 
as proposed by Mr. Disraeli, is flatly rejected by Mr. Gladstone. On the other 
hand  he  is  ready  to  extend  the  Income-Tax to Ireland, and an income above 
£100,  the  limit  of  its  area  having  hitherto  been  at  £150 a year.  Quite incon 
sistently, however, with his just pronounced doctrine, that "it is  impossible  20 
to  distinguish  between  the  respective  value  of  intelligence,  labor  and 
property,  and  to  represent  these  relations  in  arithmetical  results,"  he  pro 
poses to  subject incomes between £100  and £150 to  a rate  of  only  5d.  in the 
pound.  Lastly,  in order to reconcile his  admiration for the Income-Tax, with 
the  avowed necessity  of its abolition, Mr. Gladstone proposes "to renew the  25 
tax for  two  years, from  April,  1853,  at 7d.  in the pound; for two  years more, 
from  April,  1855,  at  the  rate  of  6d.  in the  pound;  and for three  years  more, 
from  April,  1857,  at  the  rate  of  5d.  in the pound; under which proposal the 
tax  would  expire  on  5th  April,  1860." 

Having  thus  conferred,  what  he  imagines  to  be  a  boon  on  the  landed  30 

aristocracy  and the  fundholders, by his  refusal to acknowledge the principle 
of  distinction  between  realized  and  precarious  incomes,  Mr. Gladstone,  on 
the  other  hand,  is  careful to hold  out a similar bait to the  Manchester School 
by  the  adjustment  of  the  legacy  duty,  extending  it  to  all  kinds  of  property, 
but declining to deal with the probates. "I have no doubt," he remarked, "that  35 
this  tax,  if  adjusted by  the  House, will  add  £500,000 more  to  our permanent 
means  in  1853-54;  will  add  £700,000  more  in  1854-'55;  £400,000  in 
1855-56;  and  £400,000  more  in  1856-'57;  making  a  total  addition  to  the 
permanent  means  of  the  country  of  £2,000,000."  Respecting  Scotland, 
Mr. Gladstone proposed, that Is. should be added to the present Spirits' Duty 40 
of  3s.  8d.  (The  gain would be £318,000),  and also an increased impost on the

licenses  of  tea-dealers,  brewers,  malsters,  tobacco-manufacturers  and 
dealers,  and  soap-boilers. 

The  whole  amount  of  the  increased taxes  available  for the  year  1853—'54

Now,  what  are  the  propositions  of  Mr. Gladstone  with  respect  to  the 
remission  of  old  taxes?  I  shall  restrain  myself,  of  course,  from  entering  too 
15  deeply  into  this labyrinth.  It cannot be fathomed  in a moment.  Accordingly 

I  shall  touch  merely  on  the  principal  points,  which  are: 

1. The  abolition of the  duty on Soap, the gross  amount of which is actually 

£1,397,000. 

2.  Gradual  reduction  of  the  duties  on  Tea,  when  the  descent  from  2s. 

20  2'/4d.  to  Is.  is to be  brought about in about three  years. 

3. Remission  of  the  duties  upon  a  large  number  of  minor  articles. 
4. Relaxation  of  the  £4,000,000  owed  by  Ireland  in  the  shape  of  Con 

solidated  Annuities. 

5. Reduction  of  the  Attorney's  Certificate  Duty  by  one-half, according to 

25 

the  motion  of  Lord  R. Grosvenor,  which  abolished  the  whole. 

6. Reduction  of  the  Advertisement  Duty  to  6d.,  according  to  the  motion 
of  Mr. Gibson  (the  House  having,  however,  already  noted  its  entire  aboli 
tion). 

Lastly: 
7.  Abolition of the  Stamp Duty on Newspaper Supplements (a huge pièce 

30 

de  réjouissance  for  The  Times,  the  only  paper  issuing  Supplements). 

These  are,  in  short,  the  principal  features  of  the  budget which Mr. Glad 
stone  has  been  hatching now for  more than four  months.  The debate in the 
House  of  Commons,  fixed  for  Monday  next,  will  afford me  the opportunity 

35  of  further  commenting  upon  that  coalition  product.

Riot at Constantinople-
German Table Moving— 
The  Budget. 

Correspondence  of  The  N.Y.Tribune. 

London,  Friday, April 22,  1853. 

5 

A  telegraphic  dispatch has  been received  to  the  effect that on the  12th  inst. 
there was  a great tumult  at Constantinople and the vicinity, fifteen Christians 
having  been  killed  or  wounded  by  the  fanatic  Turkish  mob.  "Order  was 
immediately  restored  by  means  of  the  military  force." 

Another dispatchfrom Copenhagen states that the Chamber or Volksthing  10 

has  rejected  the  ministerial  message  on  the  proposed  succession  of  the 
Danish Crown. This we may consider as an important check to the diplomacy 
of Russia, whose interests the message represented, according to the London 
protocol  acknowledging  Russia  as  ultimate  heir  of  the  Danish  kingdom. 

From  the  Hague  we  learn  that  an  agitation  similar  to  that which visited  15 

England  two  years  ago  in  the  shape  of  "Roman  Catholic  aggression,"  has 
now  taken  hold  of  the  Netherlands,  and  led  to  the  formation  of  an  ultra-
Protestant  ministry.  Concerning  Germany,  or  rather  that  portion  of  it 
formerly  known under  the  name  of the  Empire, nothing can be more  signifi 
cant of the present state of mind prevailing through the educated middle-class 20 
than  a  declaration  of  the  editor  of  The  Frankfort  Journal,  under  date  of 
April 20.  For the  edification of your readers  I give you  a translation of it: 

"The  communications  we  receive  by  every post,  on the  subject of  table-
moving  (Tisch-Rücken) are  assuming  an  extent  to  which,  since  the  memor 
able 'Song on the Rhine,' by Nie. Becker, and the first days of the revolution  25 
of  March,  1848,  we  have  seen  nothing  equal.  Satisfactory  as  these  com-

120

munications  are,  since  they  prove  better  than  any  political  raisonnement,  in 
what  harmless  and  innocent  times  we  again  find  ourselves,  we  regret  that 
we  cannot  take  further  notice  of  them,  fearing  that  they  might  entirely 
overwhelm  our  readers  and  ourselves,  and  absorb  in  the  end  all  the  space 

5  of  this  journal." 

"An  Englishman" has  addressed  a  letter  to  The  Times,  and  Lord  Palmer 

ston,  on  the  latest  Kossuth  affair,  at  the  conclusion  of  which  he  says: 

"When  the  Coalition-Cabinet  is  gathered  to  its  fathers,  or  its  uncles,  or 
grandfathers,  we  would  delicately  hint to the noble lord a new edition of Joe 
10  Miller.  In fact we  opine we  shall hear no more of Joe. Palmerston will be the 
word.  It  is  long.  That  is  a fault.  We  believe,  however,  it  has  already  been 
improved  into  the  Anglo-Saxon  Pam.  This  will  suit  verse  as  well  as  prose, 
and  rhyme  with  'sham,  flam,  and  cram'." 

In my  letter  of  Tuesday  last  I  gave  you  a rough sketch of Mr. Gladstone's 
15 budget. I have now before me an official publication, filling 50 pages in folio : 
"The  Resolutions  to  be  proposed  by  the  Chancellor of the  Exchequer," and 
"An  expository  Statement  to  accompany the  Resolutions,"  but I  shall  only 
touch  on  those  details  which  would  be  of  interest  to  foreign readers  in the 
event  of  their  becoming  the  law  of  Great  Britain. 

20 

The  most important resolutions  are  those  concerning the Customs. There 
is a proposal to abolish the duties on 123 minor articles, yielding about £55,000 
per  annum,  and  including  all  furniture  woods  with four  exceptions,  as  well 
as  fixtures  and  frames,  bricks  and  tiles.  There  is  to  be  a  reduction,  firstly, 
on the  tea duties from 2s. 2V4d. to  Is.  lOd. till 5th April,  1854;  secondly, on 
25  12  articles  of  food.  The present duty on almonds is to be reduced to 2s.  2d. 
per  cwt.;  upon cheese from  5s.  to  2s.  6d.  per  c w t;  on cocoa from  2d.  to  Id. 
per lb. ; on nuts from 2s. to 1 s. per bushel ; on eggs from lOd. to 4d. a hundred ; 
on  oranges  and  lemons  to  8d.  a  bushel;  on butter from  10s.  to  5s. per cwt.; 
on raisins  from  15s.  9d.  to  10s.  per  cwt.;  and  on  apples  from 2s.  to  3d.  per 
30  bushel.  The whole  of these  articles yield,  at present,  a revenue of £262,000. 
There  is,  in the third place, to be  a reduction on  133 articles of food, yielding 
a revenue  of £70,000.  Besides,  a  simplification is  to  be  applied  on  a number 
of  articles  by  the  levy  of  specific  instead  of  ad  valorem  duties. 

35 

As  to  the  Excise,  I  have  already  stated the proposed abolition of the  soap 
tax,  and  the  increase  in  the  scale  of  licenses  to  brewers  and dealers  in tea, 
coffee,  tobacco  and  soap. 

As  to  the  Stamps, besides  the  reduction on  attorneys'  certificates,  and in 
the  advertisement  duty,  there  is  to be  a reduction of the  duty  on life  assur 
ances,  on  receipt  stamps,  on  indentures  of  apprenticeship,  and  on hackney 

40  carriages. 

As  to  Assessed  taxes,  there  is  to  be  a reduction of  the  taxes  on  men-ser-

121 

Karl  Marx 

vants, private carriages, horses, ponies, and dogs,  and areductionof  Π ' / Σ Ρ ^Γ 
cent,  in  the  charge  for  redemption  of  land  tax. 

As  to  the  Post-Office,  there  is  to  be  a  reduction  of  colonial  postages  to 

a  uniform  rate  of  6d. 

A  general  feature  of  the  budget  deserving  note,  is  the  circumstance  of 
most  of  its  provisions  having  been  forced  on  the  Coalition  Ministry,  after 
an  obstinate  opposition  to  them  in  the  course  of  the  present  session.

Mr. Gladstone  proposes  now to  extend  the  legacy  duty  to  real  property; 
but  on  the  1st  of  March  he  still  opposed  Mr. Williams's  motion,  that  real 
property  should  be  made  to  pay  the  "same  probate  and  legacy  duties  as are  10 
now  payable  on  personal  property!"  He  affirmed  on  that  occasion,  as  the 
Tory journals do at this very moment, that the exemption was only apparent, 
and  counterbalanced  by  other  duties  peculiar  to  real  property.  It is  equally 
true, that on the  same  1st of March,  Mr. Williams  threatened Mr. Gladstone 
with  "being  replaced  by  Mr. Disraeli,  if  he  were  not  to  give  way  on  that  15 
point." 

Mr. Gladstone  proposes  now to  abolish  or reduce  the protective  duties  on 
about 268 minor articles ; but on the 3d of March he still opposed Mr. Hume's 
motion,  of  "speedily  repealing  the  strictly  protective  duties  on  about 
285  articles."  It  is  also  true  that  Mr. Disraeli  declared  on that day that "we  20 
could  not  cling  to  the  rags  and  tatters  of  the  Protective  System." 

Mr. Gladstone proposes  now to reduce the advertisement duty by one half ; 
but  only  four  days  before  he  brought  out  his  Budget  he  opposed  Mr. Milner 
Gibson's  motion,  to  repeal  that  duty.  It  is  true  that  he  was  defeated  by  a 
division  of the  House. 

25 

It  would  be  easy to  augment this  enumeration of concessions  made by the 
Coalition  ministry,  to  the  Manchester  school.  What  do  these  concessions 
prove?  That  the  industrial  bourgeoisie,  weakly  represented  as  it  is  in  the 
House,  are yet the real masters of the situation, and that every Government, 
whether  Whig,  Tory,  or  Coalition,  can  only  keep  itself  in  office,  and  the  30 
bourgeoisie  out  of  office,  by  doing  for  them  their  preliminary  work.  Go 
through  the  records  of  British  legislation  since  1825,  and  you will  find  that 
the  bourgeoisie  is  only  resisted  politically  by  concession  after  concession 
financially.  What  the  Oligarchy  fail  to  comprehend,  is  the  simple  fact  that 
political  power is  but the  offspring  of  commercial  power,  and  that the  class 
to  which they  are  compelled  to  yield  the  latter,  will  necessarily  conquer the 
former  also.  Louis  XIV.  himself,  when  legislating  through  Colbert  in  the 
interest  of  the  manufacturers,  was  only  preparing  the  revolution  of  1789, 
when  his  "l'état  c'est  moi"  was  answered  by  Sieyès  with  "le  tiers  état  est 
tout. " 

35 

40 

Another  very  striking  feature  of  the  budget  is  the  strict  adoption  of  the 

122 

Riot  at  Constantinople—German  Table  Moving—The  Budget 

policy  of  Mr. Disraeli,  "that reckless  adventurer" who  dared to affirm in the 
House  that  the  necessary  result  of  commercial  free-trade  was  a  financial 
revolution,  that  is  to  say,  the  gradual  commutation  of  indirect  into  direct 
taxation.  Indeed,  what  does  Mr. Gladstone  propose?  He  strengthens  and 
5  extends  the  system  of  direct  taxation,  in  order  to  weaken  and  to  contract 

the  system  of  indirect  taxation. 

On  the  one  side  he  renews  the  income-tax unaltered  for  seven years.  He 
extends  it to  a whole  people, to the Irish.  He  extends  it by copying Mr. Dis 
raeli,  to  a  whole  class,  to  the  holders  of  incomes  from  £100  to  £150.  He 
10  accepts, partially, the extension of the house-tax, proposed by Mr. Disraeli, 
giving it the name of an altered license-tax and raising the charge for licenses 
in proportion to the  size of the premises.  Lastly, he augments direct taxation 
by £2,000,000, by subjecting real property to  the legacy duty, which was  also 
promised  by  Mr. Disraeli. 

15 

On  the  other  side  he  attacks  indirect  taxation  under  the  two  forms  of 
Customs  and  of  Excise;  in  the  former  by  adopting  Disraeli's  reduction  of 
the  tea duties,  or by  abolisliing, reducing,  or  simplifying the  customs  duties 
on  286  articles;  in  the  latter  by  entirely  abonshing  the  soap-tax. 

The only difference  between his  budget and  that of his predecessor is this, 
that the  one  was  the author,  and that the other is the plagiary; that Disraeli 
removed  the  excise-duties  in  favor  of  the  land-interest,  and  that Gladstone 
removes  them  in  favor  of  the  town-interest;  that  Disraeli  proclaimed  the 
principle,  but was  forced  by his  exceptional position to  falsify the  practice, 
while Gladstone, opposed to the principle, is enabled by his coalition charac-
ter  to  carry  details  through  a  series  of  compromises. 

20 

25 

What  will  be  the  probable  fate  of  the  Coalition  budget,  and what will be 

the  probable  attitude  assumed  by  the  respective  parties? 

There  are,  in general, but three  points  on which the battle can be fought— 

the  Income-Tax,  the  Legacy-Duty,  and  Ireland. 

30 

The  Manchester  school  has  pledged  itself  to  oppose  any prolongation of 
that  "horrid  inequality,"  the  present  Income-Tax.  The  oracle  of  Printing-
house-square,  The  Times,  has  thundered  for  ten  years  against  that  same 
"monstrosity,"  and  the  public  prejudice  of  Great  Britain  in  general  has 
doomed  the  present  system  of  charging  equally  all descriptions of  income. 
35  But on this one point Mr. Gladstone repudiates compromise. As Mr. Disraeli, 
when  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer,  proposed  to  modify the Income-Tax by 
establishing a distinction between precarious revenues and realized property, 
charging the former with 5d.  and  the  latter with là.  in the pound, the Income-
Tax  would  seem to become  the  rallying point for the common opposition of 
the  Conservatives,  the Manchester  school and  the  "general opinion" repre 
sented  by  The  Times. 

40 

123 

Karl  Marx 

But  will  the  Manchester men redeem  their  pledge?  This  is  very  doubtful. 
They  are  in  the  commercial  habit  of  pocketing  the  present  profits,  and  of 
letting  principles  shift  for  themselves.  And  the  present  profits  offered  by 
Mr. Gladstone's  budget  are  by  no  means contemptible.  Already the tone  of 
the Manchester organs has become very moderate and very conciliatory with 
regard to  the  Income  Tax.  They  begin to  comfort themselves  with the pros 
pect  held out by Mr. Gladstone,  that "the whole  Income  Tax  shall expire  in 
seven  years,"  forgetting  at  the  opportune  moment  that,  when  the  late  Sir 
Robert Peel introduced it in  1842, he promised its expiration by the year 1845, 
and  that  the  extension  of  a tax  is  a very  awkward  way  toward  its  ulterior  10 
extinction. 

5 

As  to  The  Times,  that  is  the  only  journal  which  will  profit  by  Mr. Glad 
stone's  proposal  of  aboUshing the  stamp  on newspaper  supplements.  It has 
to  pay  for  double  supplements  every  day  that  it  publishes  them  during the 
week  40,000  pence,  or  £166  13s.  The  whole  of  the  40,000d.  remitted  by  15 
Mr. Gladstone will go into its coffers. We can then conceive that the Cerberus 
will  be  soothed  down  into  a  lamb,  without  Mr. Gladstone  being  metamor 
phosed  into  a Hercules.  It would  be  difficult to  find  in all the Parliamentary 
history  of  Great  Britain,  a more undignified act than this  of  Mr. Gladstone, 
buying up  the  support  of  a  journal  by  inserting  a  special provision for it in  20 
the budget.  The  abolition of the  Taxes  on  Knowledge  was  chiefly asked for 
with  a  view  to  break down the  monopoly of  the  newspaper-leviathans.  The 
"unctuous"  Mr. Gladstone  adopts  only  so  much  of  that  measure  as  tends 
exactly  to  double  the  monopoly  of  The  Times. 

In  principle,  we  contend  that  Mr. Gladstone  is  right  in  rejecting  all  dis-  25 

tinctions  between  the  sources  from  which  income  is  derived.  If  you  dis 
tinguish  between  the  quality of incomes  you must also  distinguish between 
quantity,  as  in 99 cases  out of  100,  the  quantity of an income  constitutes its 
quality.  If  you  distinguish between  their  quantities  you  arrive  unavoidably 
at  progressive  taxation,  and  from  progressive  taxation  you tumble  directly  30 
into  a  very  trenchant  sort  of  Socialism,  a  thing  certainly  abhorred  by  the 
opponents  of  Mr. Gladstone.  With  the  narrow  and interested interpretation 
of  the  difference  between  fixed  and  precarious  incomes,  as  made  by  the 
Manchester  School,  we  arrive  at  the  ridiculous  conclusion that the  income 
of  the  richest  class  of  England,  the  trading  class,  is  only  a precarious  one.  35 
Under  the  pretence  of  philanthropy  they  aim  at  changing  a  portion  of  the 
public burdens from their own shoulders to the backs of the land-owners and 
fund-holders. 

As  to  the  extension of the  legacy  duty to  real property the  country party, 
as  cannot  be  doubted,  will  vehemently  resist  it.  They  naturally  desire  to  40 
receive  their  successions  as  heretofore,  untaxed; but Mr. Disraeli,  as  Chan-

124 

Riot  at  Constantinople—German  Table  Moving—The  Budget 

cellor  of  the  Exchequer,  has  acknowledged  the  injustice  of  that exception, 
and  the  Manchester  men  will  vote  as  one  man  with  the  Ministers.  The 
Morning  Advertiser  in  its  number  of  yesterday  informs  the  country  party 
that  should  they  be  imprudent enough to take their  stand on the legacy duty, 
they  must abandon all idea of being  supported by the Liberals. There exists 
hardly  any  privilege  to  which  the  British  middle  class  are  more  bitterly 
opposed, and there exists  also no more  striking instance of oligarchic legisla 
tion.  Pitt  introduced  in  1796 two bills, the  one  subjecting personal property 
to  the  probate  and  legacy  duty,  and  the  other  imposing  the  same  duties  on 
real  property.  The  two  measures were  separated because Pitt apprehended 
a  successful  opposition  from  members  of  both  houses  to  subjecting  their 
estates to those taxes.  The first bill passed the House with little or no opposi 
tion.  Only  one  division  took  place,  and  only  16  members  voted  against  it. 
The  second  bill  was  proceeded  with  through  all  its  stages,  until  it  came  to 
the third reading, when it was lost by a division of 30 against 30. Pitt, seeing 
no  chance  of  passing  the  bill  through either  house, was  forced to  withdraw 
it.  If the probate and legacy duties had been paid on real property since 17%, 
by  far  the  greater  portion  of  the  public  debt might  have  been paid  off.  The 
only  real  objection  the  country  party  could  now  make  is  the  plea  that  the 
fundholders  enjoy  a  similar  exemption,  but  they  would,  of  course,  not 
strengthen  their  position  by  rousing  against them the  fundholders,  who  are 
gifted  with  a  particular  taste  for  fiscal  immunities.

There  remains  then but one probable chance of  successfully opposing the 
Coalition  budget,  and  this  is  a  coalition  of  the  country  party  with the  Irish 
25  Brigade. It is true Mr. Gladstone has endeavored to induce the Irish to submit 
to  the  extension  of  the  Income  Tax  to  Ireland,  by  making  them  the  gift  of 
four millions  and a half of Consolidated Annuities. But the Irish contend that 
three  out  of  these  four  and  a  half  millions,  connected  with  the  famine  of 
1846—47,  were  never intended to  constitute  a national debt,  and  have  never 

30  been  acknowledged  as  such by  the  Irish  people. 

The  ministry itself  seems  not to be  quite  sure of success,  since it menaces 
an  early dissolution  of  the  House, unless  the budget be  accepted as  a whole. 
A  formidable  suggestion  this  for  the  great  majority  of  members  whose 
"pockets  have been  materially  affected by the  legitimate expenses of the last 
35  contest,"  and  for  those  Radicals  who  have  clung  as  closely  as  possible  to 
the  old  definition  of  an  Opposition;  namely,  that it does,  in the  machine  of 
Government, the duty of the safety-valve in a steam-engine. The safety-valve 
does not stop the motion of the engine, but preserves it by letting off in vapor 
the  power which might otherwise blow up  the whole  concern.  Thus they let 
40  off  in  vapor  the  popular  demands.  They  seem  to  offer  motions  only  to 
withdraw  them  afterward,  and  to  rid  themselves  of  their  superfluous  elo 
quence. 

125

A  dissolution  of  the  House  would  only  reveal  the  dissolution  of  the  old 
parties. Since the appearance of the Coalition ministry, the Irish Brigade has 
been  split  up  into  two  factions—one  governmental,  the  other  independent. 
The  country-party  is  likewise  split  up  into  two  camps—the  one  led  by 
Mr. Disraeli,  the  other  by  Sir John Pakington;  although now, in the  hour of 
danger,  they  both  rally  again  around  Disraeli.  The Radicals  themselves  are 
broken  up  into  two  sets—the  Mayfair-men  and the  Manchester-men.  There 
is  no  longer  any  power  of  cohesion  in  the  old parties, but at the  same  time 
there is no power of real antagonism. A new general election would not mend, 
but only  confirm this  state  of things.

By  the  election-disclosures  the  Lower  House  is  sunk  as  low  as  it  can 
possibly  go.  But  simultaneously,  week  after  week,  it  has  denounced  the 
rottenness  of  its  foundation,  the  thorough  corruption  of  the  constituencies 
themselves.  Now  after  these  disclosures,  will  the  ministry  venture  on  an 
appeal  to  these  branded  constituencies—an  appeal  to  the  country?  To  the  15 
country  at  large  they  have  nothing  to  offer,  holding  in one  hand  the  refusal 
of  parliamentary reform, and  in the other an Austrian patent, installing them 
as  general  informers  of  the  continental  police.

Political Position of this  Republic. 

Correspondence of The Ν. Y. Tribune. 

London,  May  1,  1853. 

Royal families formerly used to employ whipping-boys, who had the honor 
5  of receiving condign punishment on their profane backs, whenever any of 
the  scions  of  royalty  had  committed  an  offense  against  the  rules  of  good 
behavior. The modern European political system continues this practice, in 
a certain degree, in the erection of small intermediate States, which have to 
act  the  scapegoat  in  any  domestic  squabble  by  which the harmony  of the 
io  "balance of power" may be  troubled.  And  in order to enable these smaller 
States  to  perform  this  enviable  part with suitable  dignity, they are, by the 
common  consent  of  Europe  "in  Congress  assembled,"  and  with  all  due 
solemnity,  declared  "neutral."  Such  a  scapegoat,  or  whipping-boy,  is 
Greece—such is Belgium and Switzerland. The only difference is this—that 
15  these  modern  political  scapegoats, from the  abnormal conditions  of their 
existence,  are  seldom  quite  undeserving of  the  inflictions they are favored 
with. 

The  most  conspicuous  of  this  class  of  States  has  of  late  been  Switzer­

land, 

20 

Quidquid  délirant reges,  plectuntur— 
the  Swiss.  And  wherever  the  people of  any  European  State  come into colli 
sion  with  their  rulers,  the  Swiss  were  equally  sure to come in for their share 
of the trouble ; until since the beginning of this year, Switzerland, after having 
made  itself  gratuitously  contemptible  to  the  revolutionary  party,  has  been 
25  placed  in  a  sort of  interdict by the rulers  of  Continental Europe.  Squabbles 
about  refugees  with  the  Emperor  Bonaparte,  for  whose  sake  Switzerland 
once  came  very  near  risking  a  war;  squabbles  with  Prussia  on  account  of 

127 

Friedrich  Engels 

Neuchâtel;  squabbles  with  Austria  about  Tessinese  and  the  Milan  in 
surrection;  squabbles  with  the  minor  German  States  about  subjects  which 
nobody  cares  for;  squabbles  on  all  hands,  threatening  notes,  expulsions, 
passport chicanes,  blockades,  raining  down upon poor  Switzerland  thick as 
hailstones  in  a  storm,  and  yet,  such  is  human  nature,  the  Swiss  are happy, 
contented  and  proud  in  their own way, and feel more at home in this  shower 
of  abuse  and insult,  than if the  political horizon  was cloudless and bright. 

5 

This  honorable  political  position  of  Switzerland  is,  by  the  popular  mind 
of  Europe,  rather  vaguely  and  clumsily  expressed  in  the  common  saying: 
Switzerland  has  been  invented  by  the  rulers  of  Europe  in  order  to  bring  10 
republican governments into contempt; and certainly, a Metternich or Guizot 
may  have often  said:  If  Switzerland  did  not exist,  we  should  have to  create 
it.  To  them,  a  neighbor  like  Switzerland,  was  a  real  god-send. 

We  cannot be  expected  to repeat the multifarious  charges brought of late, 
against  Switzerland  and  Swiss  institutions,  by  real or would-be revolution-  15 
ists.  Long  before  the  movements  of  1848,  the  organs  of  the  revolutionary 
Communist  party  of  Germany  analyzed  that  subject,  they  showed  why 
Switzerland,  as  an  independent  state,  must  ever  be  lagging  behind  in  the 
march  of  European  progress,  and  why  that  country,  with  all its  republican 
shows, will ever be reactionary at heart. They were even violently attacked,  20 
at that time, by divers  democratic  spouters and manufacturers of clandestine 
declamation, who celebrated Switzerland as their "model-republic," until the 
model  institutions  were  once  tried  upon  themselves.  The  subject is  now  as 
trite  as  can be;  nobody  disputes  the  fact,  and a few words will  suffice to put 
the  matter in its  true  light. 

25 

The  mass  of  the  Swiss  population  follow  either  pastoral  or  agricultural 
pursuits;  pastoral,  in  the  high  mountains,  agricultural  wherever  the  nature 
of  the  ground  admits  of  it.  The  pastoral tribes, for tribes you may call them, 
rank among  the  least civilized populations  of  Europe.  If  they  do  not cut off 
heads and ears like the Turks and Montenegrians, they perform acts of hardly  30 
less  barbarity  by  their  judicial  assemblies;  and  what  cruelty  and  beastly 
ferocity  they  are capable of, the  Swiss mercenaries  at Naples  and elsewhere 
have  proved.  The  agricultural population is  quite  as  stationary  as the pasto 
ral;  they  have  nothing  in  common  with  the  agricultural  population  of  the 
American  Far  West,  whose  very  aliment  is  change,  and  who  clear  every  35 
twelvemonth  an  amount  of  land  far  larger  than  all  Switzerland.  The  Swiss 
peasant tills  the patch of ground his  father  and grandfather tilled before him; 
he  tills  it  in  the  same  slovenly  way  as  they  did;  he  earns  about as  much as 
they  did;  he Uves  about as  they  did,  and consequently he thinks very nearly 
in the  same way as  they did. Had it not been for feudal burdens and imposts  40 
levied upon them,  partly by aristocratic families,  partly by patrician corpora-

128 

Political  Position of the Swiss  Republic

tions  in  the  towns,  the  Swiss  peasantry  would  always  have  been  quite  as 
stationary  in  their  political  existence  as  their  neighbors,  the  cowherds,  are 
up to the present day. The third component of the Swiss people, the industrial 
population,  although  necessarily  far  more  advanced in civilization than the 
two  classes  mentioned  before,  yet live  under  circumstances  which  exclude 
them in  a great degree from the progressive giant impulse which the  modern 
manufacturing  system  has  imparted  to  Western  Europe.  Steam  is  hardly 
known  in  Switzerland;  large  factories  exist  in  a  few  localities  only;  the 
cheapness of labor, the  sparseness of the population, the  abundance of small 
1 o mountain-streams fit for mills ; all these and many other circumstances tend 
to  produce  a petty and  sporadic  sort of manufactures mixed up with agricul 
tural  pursuits,  the  most  eligible  industrial  system  for  Switzerland.  Thus 
watch-making,  ribbon-weaving,  straw-plaiting,  embroidery, etc.  are carried 
on  in  several cantons,  without ever creating  or even increasing  a town;  and 
15  Geneva  and  Basle,  the  richest,  and with  Zurich,  the most industrial  towns, 
have  hardly  increased  for  centuries.  If,  then,  Switzerland  carries  on  her 
manufacturing  production  almost  exclusively  upon  the  system  in  practice 
all  over  Europe  before  the  invention  of  steam,  how  can  we  expect  to  find 
other  than  corresponding  ideas  in  the  minds  of the producers;  if  steam  has 
20  not revolutionized  Swiss  production and intercommunication, how could it 

overthrow  the  hereditary  ways  of  thinking? 

The  Hungarian  Constitution bears  a certain resemblance  to  that  of  Great 
Britain,  which  circumstance  has  been  turned  to  good  account  by  Magyar 
politicans,  who  thence  would  make  us  jump  to  the  conclusion  that  the 
25  Hungarian  nation  is  almost  as  advanced  as  the  English;  and  yet  there  are 
many  hundreds  of  miles  and  of  years  between  the  petty  tradesman  of Buda 
and  the  Cotton  lord  of  Lancashire,  or  between  the  traveling  tinker  of  the 
Puszta  and  the  Chartist working-man of  a British manufacturing metropolis. 
Thus,  Switzerland  would give itself the  airs  of  a United  States  on a  smaller 
30 scale ; but barring the superficial resemblance of political institutions, no two 
countries  are  more  unlike  than  ever-moving,  ever-changing  America,  with 
a  historical  mission  whose  immensity  people  on  both  sides  of  the  Atlantic 
are  but  just beginning  to  divine,  and  stationary  Switzerland,  whose  never-
ending  petty  distractions  would  result  in the  perpetual round-about  motion 
35  within the  narrowest circle,  were  she not in spite of herself dragged forward 

by  the  industrial  advance  of  her  neighbors. 

Whoever  doubts this, will be  satisfied after a perusal of the history of Swiss 
railways.  Were  it  not  for  the  traffic  from  south  to  north  moving  round 
Switzerland  on both  sides,  not  a railroad  would  ever  have been constructed 
in that country.  As  it is,  they  are  made  twenty  years  too  late.

occasion  to  the peasantry to throw off their feudal burdens; to the manufac 
turing  and  trading  population  to  throw  off  the  mediaeval  yoke  of  patrician 
and  corporative  control.  With  this  progress  the  revolution  of  Cantonal 
Government  was  completed.  The  more  advanced  Cantons  had  obtained 
constitutions  to  suit their  interests.  This  Cantonal  revolution reacted  upon 
the  Central  Representation Assembly  and  Executive. The party vanquished 
in the individual Cantons was here strong; the struggle was fought over again. 
The  general  political  movement  of  1840—'47,  which  everywhere  in  Europe 
brought  about  preUminary  conflicts,  or prepared  decisive  collisions,  was  in 
all second and third-rate States—thanks to the jealousies of the great powers— 10 
favorable  to  the  opposition,  which  may  be  described  as  the  middle-class 
party.  It was the  case, too,  in  Switzerland; the moral  support of Britain, the 
indecision  of  Guizot,  the  difficulties  which  kept  Metternich  at bay in Italy, 
carried  the  Swiss  over the  Sonderbund war; the party which had been victo 
rious  in the liberal Cantons in  1830 now conquered the Central Powers. The  15 
revolutions  of  1848  made  it  possible  for  the  Swiss  to  reform  their  feudal 
constitutions  in  accordance  with  the  new  political  organization  of  the  ma 
jority  of  the  Cantons;  and  now  we  may  say  that  Switzerland  has  attained 
the  highest  political  development  of  which  she,  as  an independent State, is 
capable.  That the  new federal constitution is  quite  adequate to the wants of  20 
the  country,  the  constant  reforms  in  the  monetary  system,  the  means  of 
communication,  and  other  legislative  matters  affecting  the  industry  of  the 
country,  abundantly  show;  but,  alas!  these reforms  are  of a nature that any 
other  State  would  be  ashamed  of,  on  account  of  the  mass  of  traditionary 
nuisances,  and the  antediluvian state of society, the existence of which, up  25 
to  that  date  they  disclose. 

What,  at most,  can  be  said  in  favor  of  the  Swiss  Constitution  of  1848  is 
this:  that by  its  enactment  the  more civilized portion of the  Swiss  declared 
themselves  willing  to  pass,  to  a  certain  extent,  from  the  middle  ages  into 
modern society.  Whether, however, they will at any time be able to do away  30 
with  privileged  trades'  corporations,  guilds,  and  such-like  mediaeval  ameni 
ties,  must  remain  very  doubtful  to  any one  who has  the least knowledge  of 
the  country,  and who has  seen in a single instance the  strenuous  efforts with 
which respectable  "vested interests"  oppose even the most matter-of-course 
reform. 

35 

Thus  we  see  the  Swiss, true to  their  character, moving on quietly in then-
own restricted domestic circle  while the  year  1848  uprooted  all the  stability 
of the  European Continent around them. The revolutions of Paris, of Vienna, 
of  Berlin,  of  Milan,  were  by  them  reduced  to  as  many  levers  of  Cantonal 
intrigue.  The  European earthquake had even for the radical Swiss no other  40 
interest but  this—that it  might vex  some  conservative  neighbor by upsetting 

130 

Political  Position  of  the  Swiss  Republic 

his  crockery.  In  the  struggle  for  Italian  independence  Sardinia  solicited  an 
alliance  with  Switzerland,  and  there  is  no  doubt  that  an  addition  to  the 
Sardinian  army  of  20  or  30,000  Swiss  would  have  very  soon  driven  the 
Austrians  out  of  Italy.  When  15,000  Swiss  in  Naples  were  fighting  against 
Italian  liberty  it  certainly  might  be  expected  that  Switzerland,  in  order  to 
maintain  her  boasted  "neutrality, " should  send  an  equal number  to  fight for 
the  Italians;  but  the  alliance  was  rejected  and  the  cause  of  Italian  inde 
pendence  was  lost  as  much  through  Swiss  as  through  Austrian  bayonets. 
Then  came  the  disasters  of  the  revolutionary  party,  and  the  wholesale 
emigration from Italy,  from France, from Germany, to the neutral Swiss  soil. 
But there  neutrality ceased;  Swiss  radicalism  was  satisfied  with what it had 
achieved,  and  the  very  insurgents,  who,  by holding in check the  tutors  and 
natural  superiors  of  Switzerland,  the  absolutist  governments  of  the  Con 
tinent, had enabled the  Swiss to carry out their internal reform undisturbed— 
these  very  insurgents  were  now  treated  in  Switzerland with every  possible 
insult  and  turned  out  of  the  country  at the  first bidding of their persecutors. 
Then  began  that  series  of  degradation  and  insult  which  one  neighboring 
government  after  another  heaped  upon Switzerland,  and  which  would  make 
the  blood  of  every  Swiss  boil  if  Swiss  nationality  had  any  foundation  and 
Swiss  independence  any  existence  other  than  in  boast  or  fame. 

Never  has  such  treatment  been  offered  to  any  people  as  the  Swiss  have 
been made  to  submit to by  France,  Austria,  Prussia,  and the  minor  German 
States.  Never  were  demands  half  as  humiliating  made  upon  any  country, 
without  being  resented  by  a  struggle  for  life  or  death.  The  surrounding 
Governments, by their agents, presumed to exercise the office of Police upon 
the  Swiss  territory;  they  exercised  it  not  only  over  the  refugees,  but  over 
the  Swiss Police officers  also.  They laid complaints  against subaltern agents, 
and demanded their dismissal; they even went so far as to hint at the necessity 
of changes in the Constitutions of several Cantons. As for the Swiss Govern 
ment,  to  every  bolder  demand,  it  gave  an  humbler  reply;  and whenever its 
words  breathed  a  spirit  of  opposition,  its  acts  were  sure  to  make  up  for  it 
by  increased  subserviency.  Insult  after  insult was pocketed,  command after 
command  was  executed,  until  Switzerland  was  brought  down to  the  lowest 
level  of  European contempt,—till  she  was  more  despised than  even her  two 
"neutral"  rivals,  Belgium  and  Greece.  And  now,  when  the demands  of her 
chief  assailant,  Austria,  have  reached  that  hight  of  impudence  which  even 
a  statesman of  the  temper  of  M. Druey  could  hardly  swallow, without some 
show  of resistance—now,  in  her  most recent,  most  spirited  notes  to  Vienna, 
she  shows  how  far  she  is  reduced. 

The  champions  of  Italian independence,—men who, far from  showing any 
wicked  Socialist  or  Communist  tendencies,  would,  perhaps,  not even go to 

131 

Friedrich  Engels 

the  length  of  wishing  for  Italy  the  same  Constitution  as  that  under  which 
Switzerland  Uves—men  who  have  and  make  no  claim  to  the  demagogical 
celebrity  even  of  Mazzini,  are  there  treated  as  assassins,  incendiaries, 
brigands,  and upsetters of all social order.  As to  Mazzini,  the language is of 
course  far  stronger;  and  yet  everybody  knows  that  Mazzini,  with  all  his 
conspiracies  and insurrections,  is  as  much a supporter of  social order,  as  at 
present  constituted,  as  M.Druey  himself.  Thus,  the  result  of  the  whole 
exchange  of  notes  is,  that,  in  principle,  the  Swiss  give  in  to  the  Austrians. 
How,  then,  is  it  to  be  expected  they  will  not  give  in  in practise? 

5 

The  fact  is  this:  Any  bold  and  persistent  Government  can  get  from  the  10 

Swiss  what  it likes.  The isolated  life  which the  mass  of them lead,  deprives 
them  of  all  sense  of  their  common  interest  as  a  nation.  That  a village,  or a 
valley,  or  a canton  should  stick together is no wonder. But, to  stick together 
as  a  Nation  for  a  common  purpose,  be  what  it  may,  they  never  will.  In  all 
invasions, as  soon as the danger becomes  serious, as in  1798, one Swiss has  15 
betrayed  the  other,  one  Canton  abandoned  the  next.  The  Austrians  have 
expelled  18,000  Tessinese  from  Lombardy,  without  any  cause.  The  Swiss 
make  a  great  outcry  about  it  and  collect  money  for  their  unfortunate  con 
federates.  Now,  let  Austria hold out,  and continue to prohibit the return of 
these  Tessinese,  and  in  a  very  short time  you  will  see  a wonderful  change  20 
in  Swiss  opinion.  They will get tired of collecting  money, they will  say that 
the  Tessinese  always  meddled  in  Italian  politics  and  deserved no better;  in 
fact  they  are  no  true  Swiss  confederates  (Keine guten  Eidgenossen).  Then 
the  expelled  Tessinese  will  settle  in  the  other  cantons  of  Switzerland  and 
"turn  the  natives  out  of  employment."  For  in  Switzerland  a  man  is  not  a  25 
Swiss,  but  a native of  such and  such a canton. And when that comes to pass, 
then  you  will  see  our  brave  confederates  muster  up  their indignation, then 
you  will  see  intrigues  of  all  sorts  directed  against  the  victims  of  Austrian 
despotism, then you will see the Tessinese Swiss as much hated, persecuted, 
calumniated  as  the  foreign refugees  were  during their  time  in Switzerland,  30 
and  then  Austria  will  obtain  everything  she  wants  and  a great deal  more  if 
she  takes  the  trouble  to  ask  for  it. 

When  the  nations  of  Europe  have  recovered  their  faculty  of  free  and 
normal  action they  will take into consideration what is to be done with these 
petty  "neutral" States,  which while  subservient to  counter-revolution when  35 
it is ascendant, are neutral and even hostile to every revolutionary movement 
and  yet pass  themselves  off  as free  and  independent Nations.  But, perhaps, 
by  that  time,  not  a  trace  will be  left  of  these  excrescences  of  an  unsound 
body.

The  Rocket  Affair—The  Swiss  Insurrection. 

Correspondence  of  The  Ν. Y. Tribune. 

London,  Friday,  April  29,  1853. 

The  notorious  Polizei-Director Stieber,  accompanied  by  the  Police  Lieuten-
5  ant,  Goldheim,  and the  Criminal-Rath, Nòrner, arrived here a few days ago, 
from  Berlin,  on  the  special  mission  of  connecting the  Rotherhithe  gunpow 
der-plot  with  the  Calabrian  hat-conspiracy  at  Berlin.  I  know,  from  private 
information,  that  they  met  at  Kensington,  in  the  house  of  Fleury,  and that 
the  ex-clerk  Hirsch  was  also  present  at  that  meeting.  A  day  later the  same 
10  Hirsch had a secret interview with Mr. Kraemer, thé Russian consul. If your 
readers  recollect  my  letter  on  the  Cologne  trials,  they  must  be  aware,  that 
the  identical  personages  who  concocted  that  plot,  are  again  at  work. 

On  Saturday,  23d  inst.,  proceedings  were  commenced, before Mr. Henry, 
the Bow-st. Police  Magistrate, against Mr. Hale, the proprietor of the Rother-
15  hithe  rocket  manufactory,  where  the  Government  seizure  had  been  made. 
On that day, the question discussed was  merely relating to the point, whether 
the  explosive material under  seizure was gunpowder, or not.  Mr. Henry who 
had  reserved  his  decision  until  yesterday,  has  now  pronounced,  contra 
dictorily  Mr. Ure,  the  celebrated  chemist's  opinion,  that it  was  gunpowder. 
20  Accordingly,  he  fined  Mr. Hale  2s.  for  every pound of gunpowder, beyond 
the  legal  allowance,  found  in  his  possession,  which  quantity  amounted  to 
57 lbs.  W. Hale, R. Hale, his  son,  and J. Boylin, then appeared at the side bar 
to  answer the  charge  of having,  at various  intervals, between  Sept.  13,1852 
and  April  13,  1853,  made  or  caused  to  be  made  divers  large  quantities  of 
rockets.  Mr. Bodkin,  the  Government solicitor,  stated that Mr. W. Hale  had 
made  several  unsuccessful  applications  to  the  British  Government  with 
regard  to  his  rockets, that from  October,  1852,  a great number  of  workmen 
had  been  employed  by  him,  some  of whom were  foreign refugees;  that the 

25 

133 

Karl  Marx/Friedrich  Engels 

whole  of  their  proceedings  had  been  carried  on  in  the  greatest  possible 
secrecy,  and  that  the  shipping  records  at  the  Customs  refuted  Mr. Hale's 
statement of having been an exporter through the Customs. At the conclusion 
he  said:  "The  cost  of  the  rockets  found  in  possession  of  Mr. Hale,  was 
estimated  at  from  £1,000  to  £2,000.  Where  did  the  money  come  from? 
Mr. Hale  was  only  lately  a  bankrupt,  and  superseded  his  bankruptcy  by 
paying only 3s.  in  the  pound."  J. Sanders,  a  sergeant of the Detective Police 
stated,  that he took possession of "1,543 loaded rockets, 3,629 rocket heads, 
2,489  rocket bottoms,  1,955  empty  rockets,  22  iron  shot,  2  instruments  for 
firing rockets." A witness,  Mr. Usener,  next appeared, who said that he had  10 
been  for  15  years  an  officer  in  the  Prussian  artillery,  and  served  in  the 
Hungarian  war  as  Major  of  the  staff.  He was employed by the Messrs.  Hale 
in  making  rockets  at  Rotherhithe.  Before  going  to  the  factory  he  had been 
in  prison  for  theft  for  five  or  six  months  at  Maidstone,  to  which  step  he 
declared  he  had  been  driven by  utter  destitution.  The  most important part  15 
of  his  deposition  was  literally  as  follows: 

5 

"I was  introduced  to  the  Hales  by M. Kossuth;  I first  saw  M. Kossuth on 
the  subject  last  summer,  on  his  return  from  America;  about  the  middle  of 
September  I  saw  the  elder  Mr. Hale  in  the  company  of  M. Kossuth,  at  the 
house  of  the  latter;  a Hungarian,  the  adjutant,  was  also  there;  M. Kossuth  20 
said to Mr. Hale,  'This  person was in the Hungarian service, and a late officer 
of  the  Prussian  artillery,  and  I  can recommend  him  to  your employ to assist 
in making ourrockets, or your rockets,' I don't remember which was the word 
he  said;  M. Kossuth  said my wages  should be  18s.  per week,  and he recom 
mended  me  to  keep  the  affair  quite  secret;  Mr. Hale,  he  said,  would  point  25 
out  what  I  was  to  do;  M. Kossuth  spoke partly in the  Hungarian  and partly 
in the  English language;  I believe Mr. Hale does not understand the German 
language.  The  word  secret was  said  to  me  in  German;  I  was  sent to  Pimlico 
by R. Hale  to  see M. Kossuth; I saw M. Kossuth at Pickering Place; W. Hale 
and  another  Hungarian were  there;  we  went to  try  a firing  machine; when  30 
we were  all together,  the machine was  set up,  and  a trial was  made with the 
rockets;  the  conversation took place partly in English, and chiefly about the 
quality  of  the  rockets  etc.;  we  were  there  an  hour  and  a  half,  and  when  it 
was all over, M. Kossuth and Mr. Hale desired us to leave the house carefully, 
one by one, and Mr. Hale joined us at the corner of the street; on this occasion  35 
M. Kossuth  repeatedly  told  us  to  keep  his  connection  with  the  rockets  se 
cret." 

W.Gerlach,  another  German,  was  then examined  through  an interpreter. 
He  was  employed  at  Mr. Hale's  factory,  in  making  rockets.  There  were, 
besides  him,  three  Hungarians.  He  was  recommended  to  Mr. Hale  by  40 
M. Kossuth,  but  he  never  saw  them  in  company  together. 

134 

The  Rocket  Affair—The  Swiss  Insurrection 

Mr. Henry, who had the alternative of committing summarily in the penalty 
of £5,  or  sending the  case before  the Assizes,  adopted the latter course, but 
was  willing  to  accept bail  for  each  of  the  Hales.  Mr. W. Hale  declared  that 
he  would  not  ask  any friend to become bail, either for himself or for his  son, 
and  accordingly  the  defendants were removed to  Horsemonger-lane Jail. 

5 

The  depositions  of  the  witnesses,  it  is  clear,  are  in  strong  contradiction 
with  the  letter  of Mr. Hale, Jr.;  the  substance  of which I have  already com 
municated  to  you,  and,  with  the  letters  addressed  by  Kossuth  to  Captain 
Mayne  Reid  and  Lord  Dudley  Stuart,  wherein  he  affirmed  he knew nothing 
10  either of Mr. Hale, or his rockets. It would be unjust, however, to draw any 
inference  from  this  circumstance,  before  further  explanations  shall  have 
been given by M. Kossuth. As to Mr. Usener, is it not a shame that a talented 
countryman  of  ours  in  exile,  and  a  man  most  willing  to  labor,  as  is  proved 
by  the  fact  of  his  agreeing to become  an  ordinary workman at  18s.  a week, 
should have  been driven by mere  destitution to  theft, while certain German 
refugees,  notorious  idlers,  assume  the  privilege  of  squandering  the  small 
funds  destined for the revolutionists, in self-imposed missionary trips, ridicu 
lous  plots,  and  public  house  conciliabules!

On  Friday,  the  22d  inst.,  an  insurrection  broke  out  again  at  Fribourg,  in 
20  Switzerland,  the  fifth,  already,  since  the  late  Sonderbund  war.  The  in 
surrection  was  to  be  commenced  simultaneously  all  over  the  surface  of  the 
canton;  but  at  the  given  moment,  the  majority  of  the  conspirators  did  not 
come forward. Three  "colonnes," who had promised their cooperation in the 
affair,  remained behind.  The insurgents, who actually entered the town, were 
chiefly  from  the  district  of  Farvagny,  and  from  the  communes  of  Autigny, 
Prez,  Torny,  Middes,  and  other  neighborhoods.  At  4ll2  a.m.  the  body  of 
400  peasants,  all  wearing  the  colors  of  the  Sonderbund,  and  carrying  the 
emblem of the Virgin on their standard, moved towards Fribourg, on the road 
from  Lausanne,  headed  by  Colonel  Perrier,  and  the  notorious  peasant 
30  Carrard,  the  chief  of  the  insurrection of  1851,  who  had been amnestied by 
the  Grosse-Rath.  About  5  o'clock they entered the town,  by the  "Porte  des 
Etangs,"  and  took  possession  of  the  College  and  the  Arsenal,  where  they 
seized  150  guns.  Alarm  having  been  beaten,  the  town  council  immediately 
declared the  state  of  siege,  and  Major  Gerbex  assumed the command of the 
35 assembled civic guard. While he ordered the streets at the back of the college 
to be occupied with cannon, he pushed a body of riflemen forward, to  attack 
the  insurgents  in  front.  The  riflemen  advanced  up  the  two  flights  of  steps, 
leading  to  the  college,  and  soon  dislodged  the  peasants  from  the  windows 
of  the  buildings.  The combat had lasted for about an hour, and the assailants 
40  already  numbered  eight  dead  and  eighteen wounded,  when  the  insurgents, 
attempting  in  vain  to  escape  through  the  back  streets,  where  they  were 

135 

Karl  Marx/Friedrich  Engels 

received  with grape  shot,  sent forth a priest with a white flag, declaring then-
readiness  to  surrender. 

A  Committee  of  the  Civic  Guard instantly formed  a Courtmartial, which 
condemned  Col.Perrier  to  thirty  years'  imprisonment,  and  which  is  still 
sitting. The number of prisoners is about two hundred, among whom Messrs. 
Wuilleret,  Week  and  Chollet.  M. Charles,  the  president  of  the  well-known 
Committee  at Posieux,  has been seen at the gate of Romont, but not captured. 
Besides  the  parson of Torny le  Grand,  two  other priests  are  included in the 
number  of  prisoners.  As  to  the  expenses  of  the  affair,  the  canton  appears 
to  be  safe,  half  the  property  of  the  patrician,  Mr. Week,  being  sufficient for 
that  object.

Affairs  in  Holland—Denmark-
Conversion of  the  British Debt-
India, Turkey and Russia.

Correspondence  of  The  N.Y.Tribune. 

London,  Tuesday,  May 24,  1853. 

The  general  elections  in  Holland,  necessitated by  the  late  dissolution of  the 
States-General,  are  now  completed,  and  the  result has been the  return of a 
majority  of  12  in  favor  of  the  Ultra-Protestant  and  Royalist  ministry. 

Denmark is  by  this  time inundated with anti-governmental pamphlets, the 
10  most  prominent  of  which  are  the  "Dissolution  of  Parliament  explained  to  the 
Danish  People, " by  Mr. Grundvig,  and  one  anonymous  entitled  "The  disr 
puted  question  of  the  Danish  succession;  or  what is  to  be  done  by  the Powers 
of  Europe."Both  these  pamphlets  aim  at  proving  that  the  abolition  of  the 
ancient law  of  succession  as  demanded by the ministry and stipulated in the 
15  London protocol, would turn to the ruin of the  country, by converting it, in 
the  first  instance,  into  a  province  of  Holstein,  and  later  into  a dependency 
of  Russia. 

Thus,  it  appears,  the  Danish  people  have  at  last  become  aware  of  what 
their blind opposition to  the  demands for independence raised by the duchies 
20  of  Schleswig-Holstein  in  1848  has  brought  over  them.  They  insisted  upon 
their country's permanent union with Holstein, for which purpose they made 
war  on the  German revolution—they won in that war, and they have retained 
Holstein.  But,  in  exchange  for  that conquest,  they are now doomed to lose 
their  own  country.  The  Neue Rheinische  Zeitung in  '48  and  '49  never  ceased 
to warn the Danish Democrats of the ultimate consequences of their hostility 
to  the  German  revolution.  It  distinctly  predicted  that  Denmark,  by  con-

25 

137 

Karl  Marx 

tributing  to  disarm  revolution  abroad,  was  tying  itself forever  to  a  dynasty 
which,  as  the  legitimate  course  of  succession had obtained its  sanction  and 
validity  through  their  own  consent,  would  surrender their  nationality  to  the 
"bon plaisir"  of the Russian czar.  The Danish democracy refused to act upon 
that advice, and are now receiving the  same price for their short-sighted folly 
as  the  Bohemian  Sclaves  did,  who,  in  order  to  "preserve  their  nationality 
against the  Germans,"  rushed to the destruction of the Viennese revolution 
ists,  their  only  possible  liberators  from  that  German  despotism  which they 
hated.  Is  not this  a grave  lesson  which  is  now  being received by these  two 
peoples,  who  allowed  themselves  to  be  arrayed  in self-destructive warfare  10 
against  the  cause  of  the  revolution,  by  the  intrigues  of  the  counter-revolu 
tion?

Now  that Mr. Gladstone's  scheme  for the reduction of the public debt has 
passed  through  Parliament,  and  is  undergoing  its  practical  test,  his  apolo 
gists—and  almost the  entire  London press  seemed highly to  approve of that  15 
famous  scheme—have  all  of  them  become  mute  at  once.  Mr. Gladstone's 
three  alternatives  for  voluntarily  converting  the  five  hundred  millions  of  3 
per cents.,  turn out so  very  innocent, that none  of them has  as  yet met with 
an  acceptation  worth  mentioning.  —As  to  the  conversion  of  the  South  Sea 
stock,  up to the  evening of May  19 only £100,000 out of the £10,000,000 had  20 
been  converted  into  new  stock.  It  is  a general  rule  that  such operations, if 
not  effected  in  the  first weeks,  lose  every  day  something  of  the  probability 
of  their  being  carried  out  at all.  Besides, the rate  of  interest is  just rising in 
slow  but  steady  progression.  It  is,  therefore,  almost  an  exaggeration  to 
suppose that ten millions of old paper will be converted into new stock within  25 
the  time  fixed  for  that  operation.  But  even  in  this  case,  Mr. Gladstone  will 
have  to  repay  at least eight millions of pounds to those holders of  South Sea 
Funds,  who  are unwilling to  convert them into his new stock. The only fund 
he  has  provided  for  such  an  eventuality  is  the  public  balance  at  the  Bank 
of  England,  amounting  to  about  eight  or  nine  millions.  As  this  balance,  30 
however,  is  no  excess  of income  over expenditure, but is  only lodged in the 
Bank, because the public income is paid a few months in advance of the time 
when  it  is  necessary to  expend  it, Mr. Gladstone will find himself at a future 
moment in a very heavy financial embarrassment, which will produce, at the 
same  time,  a  most  serious  disturbance  in  the  monetary transactions  of  the  35 
Bank and in the money market in general, the more so as a presumed deficient 
crop  will  cause  a  more  or  less  extensive  drain  of  bullion. 

The  charter of the East India Company expires in  1854.  Lord John Russell 
has  given  notice  in  the  House  of  Commons,  that  the  Government  will  be 
enabled to state, through Sir Charles Wood, their views respecting the future 40 
Government  of  India,  on the 3d of June.  A hint has been thrown out in some 

138 

Holland—Denmark—Conversion  of  the  British  Debt—India,  Turkey  and  Russia 

ministerial  papers,  in  support of the  already credited  public rumor,  that the 
coalition have found the means of reducing even this colossal Indian question 
to  almost  Liliputian  dimensions.  The  Observer  prepares  the  mind  of  the 
English  people  to  undergo  a new  disenchantment.  "Much less,"  we read in 
that  confidential  journal  of  Aberdeen,  "than  is  generally  supposed  will 
remain to be done in the new organization for the Government of our Eastern 
Empire."  Much less even than is  supposed, will have to be done by my lords 
Russell  and  Aberdeen.

The  leading features of the proposed change appear to consist in two very 
small  items.  Firstly,  the  Board  of  Directors  will  be  "refreshed"  by  some 
additional  members,  appointed  directly  by  the  Crown,  and  even  this  new 
blood  will  be  infused  "sparingly  at  first."  The  cure  of  the  old  directorial 
system  is  thus  meant to  be  applied,  so that the portion of blood now infused 
with  "great  caution"  will  have  ample  time  to  come  to  a  standstill  before 
15  another  second  infusion  will  be  proceeded  upon.  Secondly,  the  union  of 
Judge  and  of  Exciseman  in one  and the  same person,  will be put an end  to, 
and  the  Judges  shall  be  educated  men.  Does  it  not  seem,  on  hearing  such 
propositions,  as  if  one  were  transported back into  that earliest period of the 
middle-ages,  when the feudal lords began to be replaced  as  Judges, by law-
20  yers  who  were  required,  at  any  rate,  to  have  a knowledge  of  reading  and 

writing? 

25 

The  "Sir  Charles  Wood"  who,  as  President of  the  Board  of  Control, will 
bring  forward  this  sensible  piece  of  reform,  is the  same timber who, under 
the late Whig Administration, displayed such eminent capacities of mind,  tiiat 
the  Coalition  were  at  a dreadful loss  what to  do  with him,  till they hit upon 
the  idea  of  making  him  over  to  India.  Richard the  Third  offered  a  kingdom 
for a horse—the  Coalition offers an ass for a kingdom.  Indeed, if the present 
official  idiocy  of  an  Oligarchical  Government  be  the  expression  of  what 
England can do now, the time of England's ruling the world must have passed 

30  away. 

35 

On former  occasions  we  have  seen that the Coalition had invariably some 
fitting  reason  for  postponing  every,  even  the  smallest  measure.  Now, with 
respect  to  India  their  postponing  propensities  are  supported  by  the  public 
opinion  of two worlds.  The people of England and the people of India simul-
taneously  demand  the postponement of  all the legislation on Indian affairs, 
until the voice  of  the  natives  shall have  been heard, the necessary materials 
collected,  the  pending  inquiries  completed.  Petitions  have  already  reached 
Downing-st, from the three Presidencies, deprecating precipitate legislation. 
The  Manchester  School  have  formed  an  "Indian  Society"  which  they  will 
40  put immediately into motion, to get up public meetings in the metropolis and 
throughout  the  country,  for  the  purpose  of  opposing  any legislation on the 

139 

Karl  Marx 

subject  for  this  session.  Besides,  two  Parliamentary  Committees  are  now 
sitting  with  a  view  to  report  respecting  the  state  of  affairs  in  the  Indian 
Government.  But  this  time  the  Coalition  Ministry  is  inexorable.  It  will  not 
wait  for  the  publication  of  any  Committee's  advice.  It  wants  to  legislate 
instantly  and directly for  150 millions of people, and to legislate for 20 years 
at  once.  Sir  Charles  Wood  is  anxious  to  establish  his  claim  as  the  modern 
Manu.  Whence,  of  a  sudden,  this  precipitate  legislative  rush  of  our  "cau 
tious"  political  valetudinarians? 

5 

They want to  renew  the  old  Indian Charter for  a period  of 20 years. They 
avail  themselves  of  the  eternal  pretext  of  Reform.  Why?  The  English  oli-  10 
garchy  have  a  presentiment  of  the  approaching  end  of  their  days  of  glory, 
and they have a very justifiable desire to conclude such a treaty with English 
legislation,  that even in the case of England's escaping soon from their weak 
and rapacious hands, they shall still retain for themselves and their associates 
the  privilege  of plundering India for  the  space  of 20 years.

On Saturday last dispatches  were received by telegraph from Brussels and 
Paris,  with  news  from  Constantinople  to  May  13.  Immediately  after  their 
arrival  a  Cabinet-Council was  held  at the  Foreign-Office,  which  sat  3  hours 
and  a half.  On the  same  day orders were  sent by Telegraph to the Admiralty 
at Portsmouth, directing the departure of two steam-frigates, the London 90, 20 
and  Sanspareil  71,  from  Spithead  for  the  Mediterranean.  The  Highflyer 
steam-frigate  21,  and  Odin  steam-frigate  16,  are  also  under  orders  for 
sea. 

What  were  the  contents  of  these  dispatches  which  threw  ininisters  into 

so  sudden  an  activity,  and  interrupted  the  quiet  dulness  of  England? 

25 

You  know  that  the  question  of  the  Holy  Shrines  had  been  settled  to  the 
satisfaction  of  Russia,  and  according  to  the  assurances  of  the  Russian 
Embassy  at  Paris  and  London,  Russia  asked  for  no  other  satisfaction than 
a priority share in those holy places. The objects of Russian diplomacy were 
merely  of  such  a  chivalric character,  as were  those  of  Frederic  Barbarossa  30 
and Richard Cœur de Lion. This, at least, we were told by  The Times. "But," 
says  the  Journal  des  Débats,  "on  the  5th  of  May  the  Russian  steam-frigate 
Bessarabia  arrived  from  Odessa,  having  on  board  a  Russian  Colonel  with 
dispatches  for  Prince  Menschikoff,  and  on  Saturday,  7th  inst.,  the  Prince 
handed  to  the  Ministers  of the Porte the  draught of a convention or  special  35 
treaty,  in which the new demands and pretensions were  set forth. This is the 
document  called  the  ultimatum,  since  it  was  accompanied  by  a  very  brief 
note,  fixing  Tuesday,  10th  May,  as  the  last day on which the  refusal or the 
acceptance  of  the  Divan  could  be  received.  The  note  terminated  in  nearly 
the  following words:  'If  the  Sublime  Porte  should  think  proper  to  respond  40 
by  refusal,  the  Emperor  would be  compelled  to  see  in that  act the complete 

140 

Holland—Denmark—Conversion  of  the  British  Debt—India,  Turkey  and  Russia 

want of respect for his person, and for Russia, and would receive intelligence 
of  it  with  profound  regret.'" 

The  principal  object of  this  treaty was to  secure to the Emperor of Russia 
the  Protectorate  of  all  Greek  Christians  subject  to  the  Porte.  By the  treaty 
5  of  Kutchuk-Kainardji,  concluded  at  the  close  of  the  18th century,  a Greek 
chapel  was  allowed  to  be  erected  at  Constantinople,  and  the  privilege  was 
granted  to  the  Russian  Embassy  of  interfering  in  instances  of  collision  of 
the  priests  of that chapel with the Turks. This privilege was confirmed again 
in  the  treaty  of  Adrianople.  What  Prince  Menchikoff  now  demands,  is  the 
conversion of that exceptional privilege into the general Protectorate of the 
whole  Greek  Church  in  Turkey,  i.e.,  of  the  vast majority of the population 
of Turkey in Europe. Besides, he asks that the patriarchs of Constantinople, 
Antiochia,  Alexandria,  and  Jerusalem,  as  well  as  the  metropohtan  arch 
bishops,  shall  be  immovable,  unless  proved  guilty  of high-treason,  (against 
the Russians,) and then only upon the consent of the  Czar—in other words, 
he  demands  the  resignation  of  the  Sultan's  sovereignty  into  the  hands  of 
Russia. 

15 

10 

This was the news brought by the telegraph on Saturday: firstly, that Prince 
Menschikoff  had  granted  a  further  delay  until  14th  i n s t,  for  the  answer to 
20  his  ultimatum ;  that  then  a  change  in the  Turkish  Ministry ensued,  Reshid 
Pasha,  the  antagonist of Russia, being appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs, 
and  Fuad  Effendi  reinstated  in  his  office;  lastly,  that the  Russian  ultimatum 
had  been  rejected. 

It would have been impossible for Russia to make more extensive demands 
25  upon  Turkey,  after  a  series  of  signal victories.  This is the best proof of the 
obstinacy with which she  clings to her inveterate notion, that every interreg 
num  of  the  counter-revolution in  Europe  constitutes  a right for her to exact 
concessions  from  the  Ottoman Empire.  And,  indeed,  since  the  first  French 
revolution,  Continental  retrogression  has  ever  been  identical  with  Russian 
30  progress in the East. But Russia is mistaken in confounding the present state 
of  Europe  with  its  condition  after  the  congresses  of  Laybach  and  Verona, 
or  even  after  the  peace  of  Tilsit.  Russia herself  is more  afraid of the revolu 
tion  that  must  follow  any  general  war  on  the  Continent,  than  the  Sultan  is 
afraid  of  the  aggression  of  the  Czar.  If  the  other  powers  hold firm,  Russia 
is  sure  to  retire  in  a  very  decent  manner.  Yet,  be  this  as  it  may,  her  late 
maneuvers  have,  at  all  events,  imparted  a  mighty  impetus  to  the  elements 
engaged in disorganizing Turkey from within. The only question is this : Does 
Russia  act  on  her  own free  impulse,  or  is  she  but  the  unconscious  and  re 
luctant  slave  of  the  modern  fatum,  Revolution?  I  believe  the  latter  alterna-

The  presence  of  M.Mazzini  in  England  is  now,  at  last,  confirmed  by  a 
quasi-official  announcement  in  a  London  paper  connected  with  him.

The  trial  of  the  Messrs.  Hale,  on  account  of  the  "gunpowder-plot,"  will 
not be brought before the present assizes, but will take place in August next, 
the  Coalition-Government being  anxious  to  let  time  and oblivion interpose 
between its  "discoveries"  and the judicial  discussion of  their value.

Count Karnicky, the Austrian  Chargé  d'Affaires  at Berne, received orders 
from  his  Government,  on  the  21st  inst.,  to  quit  his  post  immediately,  and 
return to Vienna,  after notifying the President of  the Helvetic Confederation 
of  the  rupture  of diplomatic relations between Austria and Switzerland. The 
Bund,  of  the  23d,  states,  however,  that  the  Austrian  Envoy  had  already  15 
previously received permission to take a discretionary congé when he should 
think  proper.  The  ultimatum  of  Count  Karnicky  is  declared  by  the  same 
journal  to  be  the  answer  of  Austria to  the  note  of the  Bundesrath, of  May 4. 
That  the  ultimatum  contained  something  beside  a  mere  answer,  may  be 
inferred from the fact, that the Bundesrath has just called upon the Fribourg 
Government  to  account  for  their  "extreme"  measures  recently  taken 
against  the  defeated  rebels.  The  English journals  publish the  following dis 
patch  from  Berne,  dated  May  23: 

20 

"In  consequence  of  the  notification made by the  Austrian Chargé  d'Affai 
res  to  the  President  of  the  Helvetic  Confederation  of  the  rupture  of diplo-  25 
matic  relations  between  Austria  and  Switzerland,  the  Federal  Council  has 
decided  on  putting  an  immediate  end  to  the  functions  of  the  Swiss  Envoy 
at  Vienna." 

142 

Mazzini—Switzerland  and  Austria—The  Turkish  Question 

The  substance of this dispatch is, however, refuted by the following article 

in  La  Suisse,  dated  May  23: 

5 

10 

"We  are  about  in  the  same  situation  as  Piedmont.  The  negotiations  be 
tween  the  two  countries  are  interrupted...  The  Austrian  Legation remains 
at Berne for the disposal of the ordinary current of business. The  'Bund'says 
that the  recall  of  the  Swiss Chargé d'Affaires  at Vienna was desirable,  since 
he  drily  managed  there  his  own affairs on pretext of transacting those of the 
nation,  for  he  was  merely  engaged  in  the  silk  trade.  Mr. Steiger  is  but  a 
diplomatist of the  second-hand order, and  we  happen to  know that he under-
stands  a great  deal  more  about  silkworms  than  about his  official  business. 
There  was,  then, no  necessity for recalling  such  a diplomatist,  since he  had 
never been commissioned, but was already at Vienna on his own account." 

Let nobody imagine, therefore, that the Swiss are recalling to their memory 
thé  celebrated  motto  with  which  Loustalot adorned, in  1789 his  Révolutions 

15  de Paris: 

Les  grands  ne  sont  pas  grands, 
Que  parce  que  nous  sommes  à genoux. 
—Levons  nous! 

The mystery of the  Swiss courage is sufficiently explained by the presence 
20  of  the  Duke  of  Genoa  at  Paris,  and that  of  the  King  of  Belgium  in  Vienna 
and  perhaps  no  less  by  an  article  in the  French  Moniteur of  May  25th.  "No 
other  nation  must ever  interpose  between  France and Switzerland;  all other 
considerations  must  subside  before  this fundamental condition." The hopes 
of  the  Prussian  King  for  the  recovery  of  Neufchâtel,  thus  obtain  no  great 
encouragement.  A  rumor prevails,  even of the formation of  a French  corps 
d'observation  on  the  frontiers  of  Switzerland.  Louis  Napoleon,  of  course, 
would  be  but  too  glad  of  having  an  opportunity  to  revenge  himself  on  the 
Emperors  of  Russia and  Austria,  and the  Kings  of  Prussia  and Belgium, for 
the  contempt  and  ridicule  with which they have loaded him during the latter 

25 

30  months. 

The  intelligence  I  transmitted  to  you  in  my  last,  of  the  rejection  of  the 
Russian  ultimatum  and  of  the  formation  of  an  anti-Russian  Ministry  at 
Constantinople  has  since  been  fully confirmed.  The  most  recent  dispatches 
are  from  Constantinople,  of  May  17. 

35 

"On  assuming  office,  Reshid  Pasha requested from  Prince  Menchikoff  a 
delay  of  six  days.  Menchikoff refused declaring diplomatic relations broken 
off,  and  adding  that he  would  remain  at  Constantinople  three  days  more, to 
make the necessary preparations for his departure, and he exhorted the Porte 
to  reflection  and  to  profit  by  the  short  time  he  should  be  detained." 

40 

Under  date  of  Constantinople,  May  19,  we  further  learn: 

143 

Karl  Marx 

"On  the  17th,  a  meeting  of  the  Divan was  held,  at  the  issue  of  which  it 
was  definitively  resolved  that  the  convention,  as  proposed by Prince  Men-
chikoff,  could not be  accepted.  Nevertheless, on this being notified to Prince 
Menchikoff,  he  did  not quit Constantinople.  On the contrary, he has opened 
new  communications  with  Reschid  Pasha.  The  day  of  the  departure  of  the 
Russian  Embassy  is  no  longer  fixed." 

Contradictorily  to  the  latter  dispatch,  the  French  government  evening 
organ,  La  Patrie,  positively  announces  that  the  government  has  received 
intelligence  that Prince  Menchikoff  has  taken his departure for Odessa, and 
that  the  occurrence  had  occasioned  but  little  sensation  at  Constantinople. 
The  Pays  agrees  with  this  statement,  but  is  contradicted  by  the  Presse. 
Girardin  adds,  however,  that  if  the  news  was  correct,  it  might  easily  be 
accounted  for. 

"If  Prince  Menchikoff really departed from Bujukdere for Odessa, the fact 
is  that,  having  failed  in  his  mission,  (manqué  son effet),  no  alternative  was 
left  to  him  but  to  withdraw,  from  station  to  station." 

Some  papers  assert  that  the  fleet  of  Admiral  Delasusse,  has  passed  the 
Dardanelles,  and  is  now  at anchor in the  Golden  Horn,  but this  assertion is 
contradicted  by  the  Morning  Post.  The  Triester Zeitung assures  its  readers 
that, before giving an answer to Prince Menchikoff, the Porte had asked Lord 
Redcliffe  and  M.  de  la  Cour  whether  it  could  eventually  count  upon  fheir 
support.  To  this  The  Times  gives  its  solemn  contradiction. 

I  now give  you  a literal translation from the Paris  Siècle, containing some 
curious  details  with  respect  to  the  negotiations  from May 5  to  12th  at  Con 
stantinople—an  exposure  of  the  ridiculous  behavior  of  Prince  Menchikoff, 
who, in the whole of this transaction, has combined in a most disgusting style, 
Northern  barbarity  with  Byzantine  duplicity,  and  has  succeeded  in making 
Russia the  laughing-stock of Europe. This  "Grec du Bas-Empire" presumed 
to  conquer  the  sovereignty  pver  a  whole  empire  by  mere  theatrical  per 
formances.  For  Russia  there  remains  no  step  from  the  sublime  to  the  ridi 
cule—a  ridicule  which  can  only  be  wiped  out  by  blood.  But  these  days  of 
stockjobbing  moneyocracy  are  not the  days of chivalrous tournaments. The 
article  in  the  Siècle  runs  thus:— 

"On Thursday,  the  5th of  May,  the  day of departure of the French steam-
packet,  the  Sublime  Porte  communicated  copies  of  the  firman resolving the 
question  of  the  Holy  Places  to  M.  de la Cour  and  Prince  Menschikoff.  The 
day passed  away  without any  declamation, without any démarche on the part 
of  Prince  Menchikoff,  and  all  the  ambassadors,  thinking  that  question to be 
settled,  profited  by the  departure  of  the  French  steamer,  for  the  announce 
ment  of  the  happy  turn  of  affairs  to  their  respective  governments.  Prince 
Menchikoff,  however,  who  had just accepted the firman respecting the Holy 

144 

Mazzini—Switzerland  and  Austria—The  Turkish  Question 

10 

Places,  dispatched,  as  soon  as  midnight  had  arrived,  a  common  cavas,  i.e. 
a gens d'armes to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, with an ultimatum in which 
he  demanded  a  sened (treaty)  containing  the  solution  of  the  Holy  Shrines' 
question  and  the  future  guaranty  of  the  privileges  and  immunities  of  the 
5  Greek  Church,  i.e.  the  most  extensive  protectorate  of  that  Church for  the 
benefit of Russia,  such as would establish two distinct Emperors in Turkey— 
the  Sultan for  the Mussulmans,  and the Czar for the Christians. For answer 
ing this  ultimatum,  the Prince allowed only four days to the Porte, requiring, 
besides,  an  immediate  acknowledgment  of  the  receipt  of  his  ultimatum  by 
a government  officer.  The  Minister  of  Foreign Affairs  returned him a kind 
of  receipt  by  his  aga,  an  inferior  officer  of  the  gendarmery.  The  Prince 
dispatched  a  steamer  for  Odessa in the course of the  same night.  On Friday, 
6th,  the  Sultan,  having  been  informed  of the presentation of the  ultimatum 
by  such  an unusual  proceeding,  called together  the  Divan,  and gave  official 
15  notice  to  Lord  Redcliffe  and  M.  de  la  Cour  of  what  had  happened.  Those 
two  ambassadors  immediately  concerted  measures  for  a  common  policy, 
advising  the  Porte  to  reject  the  ultimatum  with  the  greatest  moderation in 
language  and  terms.  M.  de  la  Cour,  besides,  is  said to  have  most formally 
declared  that  France  should  oppose  every  Convention  infringing  the  rights 
secured  to  her  by  the  treaty  of  1740,  respecting  the  Holy  Places.  Prince 
Menchikoff,  in the mean  time,  had  retired  to  Bujukdere  (like Achilles to his 
tent.)  Mr. Carming,  on the 9th,  there requested an interview with the Prince 
with  a  view  of  engaging  him  to  a more  moderate  conduct.  Refused.  On the 
10th  the  Ministers  of  War  and  of Foreign Affairs, were at the Grand Vizir's, 
25  who  had  invited  Prince  Menchikoff  to  join  him  there  for  the  purpose  of 
attempting  to  arrive  at  a  reasonable  arrangement.  Refused.  Nevertheless, 
Prince  Menchikoff  had  intimated  to  the  Porte  that he  was  inclined  to  grant 
a further  delay  of  three  days.  Then,  however,  the  Sultan and his  Ministers 
replied,  that  their  resolutions  were  taken  and  that  time  would  not modify 
them.  This  negative  answer  of  the  Porte  was  sent toward  midnight  on the 
10th,  to  Bujukdere,  where  the whole of the Russian Embassy was collected, 
and  where  demonstrations  for  an  approaching  departure  had been made for 
several  days past. The Turkish Ministry, informed of this circumstance, was 
just  about  to  yield,  when  the  Sultan  dismissed  it  and  formed  a  new  Ad-

20 

30 

35  ministration." 

I  conclude  my  report  on  Turkish  affairs  by  an  excerpt  from  the  Cons 
titutionnel,  showing  the  conduct  of  the  Greek clergy  during  all these  trans 
actions. 

40 

"The  Greek clergy,  so  deeply interested  in this question, had pronounced 
in  favor of the  status  quo, i.e.,  in favor of the Porte.  They are protesting  en 
masse  against  the  protectorate  threatened  to  be  imposed  on  them  by  the 

145 

Karl  Marx 

Emperor  of  Russia.  Generally  speaking,  the  Greeks  desire  the  support  of 
Russia,  but  only  on condition of not being  subject to  her  direct domination. 
It is  repulsive to their minds to think that the Oriental Church,  which is the 
mother of the Russian Church,  should ever become  subordinate to the latter, 
a  thing  which  of  necessity  would  happen,  if the  designs  of  the  Petersburgh 
Cabinet  should  be  accepted."

Revolution in China and in Europe. 

A  most  profound yet fantastic  speculator on the principles which govern the 
movements  of  Humanity,  was  wont  to  extol  as  one  of the ruling  secrets  of 
nature,  what  he  called  the  law  of  the  contact  of  extremes.  The  homely 
proverb  that  "extremes  meet"  was, in his view,  a grand and potent truth  in 
every  sphere  of  life;  an  axiom  with  which  the  philosopher  could  as  little 
dispense  as  the  astronomer  with  the  laws  of  Kepler  or  the great discovery

Whether  the  "contact  of  extremes"  be  such  a  universal principle  or not, 
a  striking  illustration  of  it  may be  seen in  the  effect the  Chinese  revolution 
seems likely to  exercise upon the civilized world. Itmay seem a very strange, 
and  a  very  paradoxical  assertion  that  the  next  uprising  of  the  people  of 
Europe,  and  their  next  movement  for  republican  freedom  and  economy  of 
Government,  may  depend  more  probably  on  what  is  now  passing  in  the 
Celestial Empire,—the  very  opposite  of  Europe,—than on  any other political 
cause  that  now  exists,—more  even  than  on  the  menaces  of  Russia  and  the 
consequent likelihood  of  a  general  European war.  But yet it is  no paradox, 
as  all  may  understand  by  attentively  considering  the  circumstances  of  the 
case. 

Whatever  be  the  social  causes,  and  whatever  religious,  dynastic,  or  na 
tional shape they may assume, that havebrought about the chronic rebellions 
subsisting  in  China  for  about  ten  years  past,  and  now  gathered  together  in 
one formidable revolution, the occasion of this  outbreak has unquestionably 
been  afforded  by  the  English cannon forcing upon China that soporific drug 
called opium.  Before  the British arms the authority of the Manchou dynasty 
fell  to  pieces;  the  superstitious  faith  in the  eternity of the  Celestial  Empire 
broke  down;  the  barbarous  and  hermetic  isolation from the  civilized world 
was infringed;  and  an opening was made for that intercourse which has since 
proceeded so rapidly under the golden attractions of California and Australia.

At  the  same  time  the  silver  coin  of  the  Empire,  its  lifeblood,  began  to  be 
drained  away  to  the  British  East  Indies. 

5 

Up to  1830,  the  balance of trade being continually in favor of the Chinese, 
there  existed  an uninterrupted importation of  silver from India,  Britain  and 
the United States into China. Since 1833, and especially since 1840, the export 
of  silver from China to India has become almost exhausting for the Celestial 
Empire.  Hence  the  strong decrees  of the  Emperor  against the  opium trade, 
responded  to  by  still  stronger  resistance  to  his  measures.  Besides  this  im 
mediate  economical  consequence,  the  bribery  connected  with opium  smug 
gling  has  entirely  demoralized  the  Chinese  State  officers  in  the  Southern  10 
provinces.  Just  as  the  Emperor  was wont to  be  considered  the father  of all 
China,  so  his  officers  were  looked  upon  as  sustaining  the  paternal relation 
to their respective districts.  But this patriarchal authority, the only moral link 
embracing  the vast  machinery  of the  State,  has  gradually been corroded by 
the  corruption  of  those  officers,  who  have  made  great gains  by  conniving  15 
at  opium  smuggling.  This  has  occurred  principally  in  the  same  Southern 
provinces  where  the  rebellion commenced.  It is  almost needless  to  observe 
that,  in the  same  measure in which opium has obtained the sovereignty over 
the  Chinese,  the  Emperor  and  his  staff  of  pedantic  mandarins  have become 
dispossessed of their own  sovereignty.  It would  seem as though history had  20 
first  to  make  this  whole people drunk before it could rouse them  out of their 
hereditary  stupidity. 

Though  scarcely  existing  in  former  times,  the  import of  English cottons, 
and  to  a  small  extent  of  English  woollens, has  rapidly risen  since  1833, the 
epoch when the monopoly of trade with China was transferred from the East  25 
India Company to private commerce, and on a much greater scale since 1840, 
the  epoch when other  nations, and especially our own, also obtained a share 
in  the  Chinese  trade.  This  introduction  of  foreign  manufactures  has  had  a 
similar  effect  on  the  native  industry  to  that  which  it  formerly  had  on  Asia 
Minor,  Persia  and  India.  In  China the  spinners  and  weavers  have  suffered  30 
greatly  under  this  foreign  competition,  and  the  community  has  become 
unsettled  in  proportion. 

The  tribute  to  be  paid  to  England  after  the  unfortunate  war  of  1840, the 
great  unproductive  consumption of opium,  the  drain  of  the  precious  metals 
by  this  trade,  the  destructive  influence  of  foreign  competition  on  native  35 
manufactures,  the  demoralized  condition  of  the  public  administration, 
produced two things:  the old taxation became more burdensome and harass 
ing,  and new taxation was added to the old. Thus in a decree of the Emperor, 
dated Pekin, Jan.  5,1853, we find orders given to the viceroys and governors 
of  the  southern  provinces  of  Woo-Chang and  Han-Yang to remit and  defer  40 
the payment of  taxes,  and especially not in any case  to  exact more than the 

148 

Revolution  in  China  and  in  Europe 

regular  amount;  for  otherwise,  says  the  decree,  "how  will  the  poor people 
be  able  to  bear  it?"  "And  thus, perhaps,"  continues  the  Emperor,  "will my 
people,  in  a  period  of  general  hardship  and  distress,  be  exempted from  the 
evils  of  being  pursued  and  worried  by  the  tax-gatherer."  Such language  as 
this,  and  such  concessions  we  remember  to  have  heard  from  Austria,  the 
China  of  Germany,  in  1848. 

5 

All  these  dissolving  agencies  acting together on the finances, the morals, 
the industry,  and political  structure of China, received their full development 
under  the  English  cannon  in  1840,  which  broke  down  the  authority  of  the 
10  Emperor,  and  forced the  Celestial  Empire  into  contact with the  terrestrial 
world.  Complete isolation was the prime condition of the preservation of Old 
China.  That isolation having come to a violent end by the medium of England, 
dissolution must follow  as  surely as that of  any mummy carefully preserved 
in a hermetically  sealed  coffin,  whenever it is  brought into  contact with the 
15  open  air.  Now,  England  having brought  about  the  revolution  of China, the 
question  is  how  that  revolution  will  in  time  react  on  England,  and through 
England  on  Europe.  This  question  is  not  difficult  of  solution. 

The  attention  of  our  readers  has  often  been  called  to  the  unparalleled 
growth  of  British  manufactures  since  1850.  Amid the  most  surprising pros-
20  perity,  it  has  not  been  difficult  to  point  out the  clear  symptoms  of  an ap-
proacriing  industrial  crisis.  Notwithstanding  California  and  Australia,  not 
withstanding  the  immense  and  unprecedented  emigration,  there  must ever, 
without  any  particular  accident,  in  due  time  arrive  a  moment  when  the 
extension of the markets is unable to  keep pace with the extension of British 
25  Manufactures,  and this  disproportion  must bring about a new crisis with the 
same  certainty  as  it  has  done  in  the  past.  But,  if  one  of  the  great  markets 
suddenly  becomes  contracted,  the  arrival  of  the  crisis  is  necessarily  ac 
celerated thereby. Now, the Chinese rebellion must, for the time being, have 
precisely this  effect upon  England.  The  necessity  for opening new markets, 
30  or for extending the old ones, was one of the principle causes of the reduction 
of  the  British  tea-duties,  as,  with  an  increased  importation  of  tea,  an  in 
creased  exportation  of  manufactures  to  China  was  expected  to  take  place. 
Now,  the  value  of  the  annual  exports  from  the  United  Kingdom  to  China 
amounted,  before  the repeal in  1833  of the  trading monopoly possed by the 
35  East  India  Company,  to  only  £600,000;  in  1836,  it  reached  the  sum  of 
£1,326,388;  in  1845, it had risen to £2,394,827; in  1852, it amounted to  about 
£3,000,000.  The quantity of tea imported from China did not exceed, in  1793, 
16,067,331  lbs.;  but  in  1845,  it  amounted  to  50,714,657lbs.;  in  1846,  to 
57,584,561 lbs.;  it is  now  above  60,000,000lbs. 

40 

The  tea  crop of the last season will not prove  short, as shown already by 
the  export  lists  from  Shanghai,  of  2,000,000 lbs.  above  the  preceding  year.

Karl Marx 

This  excess  is  to  be  accounted for by two  circumstances.  On one  hand,  the 
state  of  the  market  at  the  close  of  1851  was  much depressed,  and the large 
surplus  stock left has been thrown into the export of 1852. On the other hand, 
the  recent  accounts  of  the  altered British legislation with regard to  imports 
of tea, reaching China, have brought forward all the available teas to a ready 
market,  at greatly enhanced prices.  But with respect to the coming crop, the 
case  stands  very  differently.  This  is  shown  by  the  following  extracts  from 
the  correspondence  of  a  large  tea-firm  in  London: 

"In  Shanghai  the  terror  is  extreme.  Gold has  advanced upward of 25 per 
cent.,  being  eagerly  sought for hoarding;  silver  has  so  far  disappeared  that 
none  could be  obtained to  pay  the  China  dues on the British vessels requiring 
port  clearance;  and  in  consequence  of  which  Mr. Alcock  has  consented  to 
become responsible to the  Chinese authorities for the payment of these dues, 
on  receipt  of  East India Company's  bills,  or  other  approved  securities.  The 
scarcity of the precious metals is  one  of the most unfavorable features, when 
viewed in reference to  the immediate future of commerce, as this abstraction 
occurs  precisely  at that period when their  use  is  most needed,  to  enable the 
tea and silk buyers to go into the interior and effect their purchases, for which 
a  large  portion  of bullion  is paid in  advance,  to  enable  the producers  to  carry 
on  their operations 
arrangements  for the  new  teas,  whereas  at present  nothing is talked of but 
the  means  of  protecting  person  and  property,  all  transactions  being  at  a 
stand  . ..  If the means  are  not applied  to secure the leaves in April and May, 
the  early  crop,  which  includes  all  the  finer  descriptions,  both  of  black and 
green  teas,  will  be  as  much lost  as  unreaped  wheat  at  Christmas." 

At this  period of the  year it is usual to begin making  20 

25 

Now  the  means  for  securing the  tea leaves, will  certainly  not be  given by 
the  English,  American  or  French  squadrons  stationed  in  the  Chinese  seas, 
but  these  may  easily,  by their interference, produce  such  complications,  as 
to  cut  off  all  transactions  between  the  tea-producing  interior  and  the  tea-
exporting  sea ports.  Thus,  for the present crop, a rise in the prices must be  30 
expected—speculation  has  already  commenced  in  London—and  for  the crop 
to come a large deficit is as good as certain. Nor is this all. The Chinese, ready 
though they may be, as are all people in periods of revolutionary convulsion, 
to  sell off to the foreigner all the bulky commodities they have on hand, will, 
as  the  Orientals  are  used to do in the apprehension of great changes,  set to  35 
hoarding, not taking much in return for their tea and silk, except hard money. 
England  has  accordingly  to  expect  a  rise  in  the  price  of  one  of  her  chief 
articles  of  consumption,  a  drain  of  bullion,  and  a  great  contraction  of  an 
important  market  for  her  cotton  and  woolen  goods.  Even  The  Economist, 
that  optimist  conjuror  of  all  things  menacing  the  tranquil  minds  of  the  40 
mercantile  community,  is  compelled  to  use  language  like  this: 

150 

Revolution in China and  in Europe 

"We  must  not  flatter  ourselves  with finding as extensive a market for our 
exports  to  China  as  hitherto  . ..  It is  more  probable that  our  export trade to 
China  should  suffer,  and  that  there  should  be  a diminished  demand  for  the 
produce  of  Manchester  and  Glasgow." 

5 

It must  not  be  forgotten  that the  rise  in the  price  of  so  indispensable  an 
article  as  tea,  and  the  contraction  of  so  important  a  market  as  China,  will 
coincide  with  a  deficient  harvest  in  Western  Europe,  and,  therefore,  with 
rising  prices  of  meat,  corn,  and  all  other  agricultural  produce.  Hence  con 
tracted markets for manufactures, because  every rise in the prices of the first 
10  necessaries  of  life  is  counterbalanced,  at  home  and  abroad,  by  a  cor 
responding  deduction  in  the  demand for manufactures.  From  every  part of 
Great  Britain  complaints  have  been received  on the  backward  state of most 
of  the  crops.  The  Economist  says  on  this  subject: 

"In  the  South  of  England  not  only  will  there  be  left  much land  unsown, 
15  until too  late  for  a crop  of  any  sort,  but  much  of  the  sown land will prove 
to  be foul,  or  otherwise  in  a bad  state for corn-growing.  On the  wet or poor 
soils  destined  for  wheat,  signs  that  mischief  is  going  on  are  apparent.  The 
time  for planting mangel-wurtzel may now be  said to have passed away, and 
very little has  been planted,  while  the  time  for  preparing land for the turnip 
is rapidly going by, without any adequate preparation for this important crop 
having been  accomplished  . ..  Oat-sowing has been much interfered with by 
the  snow  and  rain.  Few  oats  were  sown  early,  and  late  sown  oats  seldom 
produce  a large  crop  . ..  In  many  districts  losses  among the breeding flocks 
have  been  considerable." 

20 

25 

The  price  of  other farm-produce  than  corn is from 20 to 30, and  even 50 
per  cent,  higher  than  last  year.  On  the  Continent,  corn  has  risen  com 
paratively more  than in  England.  Rye  has  risen in  Belgium  and  Holland full 
100  per  cent.  Wheat  and  other  grains  are  following  suit. 

Under  these  circumstances,  as  the  greater part  of  the  regular commercial 
30 circle has already been run through by British trade, it may safely be augured 
that  the  Chinese  revolution  will  throw  the  spark  into  the  overloaded  mine 
of the present industrial  system and cause the explosion of the long-prepared 
general  crisis, which,  spreading  abroad, will be  closely followed by political 
revolutions  on the  Continent.  It would be  a curious  spectacle,  that of China 
sending  disorder  into  the  Western  World  while  the  Western  powers,  by 
English,  French  and  American  war-steamers,  are  conveying  "order"  to 
Shanghai,  Nankin,  and  the  mouths  of  the  Great  Canal.  Do  these  order-
mongering  powers,  which would attempt to  support the wavering Mantchou 
dynasty,  forget  that  the  hatred  against  foreigners  and  their  exclusion from 
the Empire, once the mere result of China's geographical and ethnographical 
situation,  have  become  a  political  system  only  since  the  conquest  of  the 

35 

40 

151 

Karl Marx 

country  by  the  race  of  the  Mantchou  Tartars?  There  can  be  no  doubt  that 
the  turbulent dissensions  among the  European nations who,  at the later end 
of the  17th century,  rivaled each other in the trade with China, lent a mighty 
aid  to  the  exclusive  policy  adapted  by  the  Mantchous.  But  more  than  this 
was  done by the fear of the new dynasty, lest the foreigners might favor the 
discontent existing  among a large  proportion of  the  Chinese  during the first 
half  century  or  thereabouts  of  their  subjection  to  the  Tartars.  From  these 
considerations, foreigners were then prohibited from all communication with 
the  Chinese,  except  through  Canton,  a town  at  a great  distance  from Pekín 
and  the  tea-districts,  and  their  commerce  restricted to intercourse with the  10 
Hong merchants, licensed by the Government expressly for the foreign trade, 
in  order  to  keep  the  rest of its  subjects from  all  connection with the  odious 
strangers.  In  any  case  an  interference  on the  part  of  the  Western  Govern 
ments  at this time  can only  serve  to render the revolution more violent, and 
protract the  stagnation of trade. 

5 

15 

At the  same  time  it is  to  be  observed  with regard to India, that the British 
Government  of  that country  depends  for full one  seventh of its  revenue  on 
the  sale  of  opium  to  the  Chinese,  while  a  considerable  proportion  of  the 
Indian  demand  for  British  manufactures  depends  on the  production  of  that 
opium  in  India.  The  Chinese,  it is  true,  are  no  more  likely  to  renounce the  20 
use  of  opium  than  are  the  Germans  to  forswear  tobacco.  But  as  the  new 
Emperor  is  understood  to  be  favorable  to  the  culture  of the  poppy  and  the 
preparation  of  opium  in  China  itself,  it  is  evident that  a  death-blow is  very 
likely to be  struck at once at the business of opium-raising in India, the Indian 
revenue,  and  the  commercial  resources  of  Hindostán.  Though  this  blow  25 
would  not  immediately  be  felt  by  the  interests  concerned,  it would  operate 
effectually  in  due  time,  and  would  come  in  to  intensify  and  prolong  the 
universal  financial  crisis  whose  horoscope  we  have  cast  above. 

Since  the  commencement  of  the  eighteenth  century  there  has  been  no 
serious  revolution in Europe  which had not been preceded by  a commercial  30 
and financial crisis. This applies no less to the revolution of  1789 than to that 
of  1848.  It  is  true,  not  only  that  we  every  day  behold  more  threatening 
symptoms  of conflict between the ruling powers  and their  subjects, between 
the  State  and  society,  between  the  various  classes;  but  also the  conflict of 
the  existing powers  among  each other  gradually  reaching  that  hight  where  35 
the  sword  must  be  drawn  and  the  ultima ratio of princes  be  recurred to.  In 
the  European  capitals,  every  day  brings  dispatches  big with universal war, 
vanishing  under  the  dispatches  of  the  following  day,  bearing the  assurance 
of  peace  for  a  week  or  so.  We  may be  sure, nevertheless,  that to  whatever 
hight the conflict between the European powers may rise, however threaten-  40 
ing  the  aspect  of  the  diplomatic  horizon  may  appear, whatever  movements 

152 

Revolution  in  China  and  in  Europe 

may  be  attempted  by  some  enthusiastic  fraction  in  this  or that country,  the 
rage  of princes  and  the fury of  the people  are  alike  enervated by the breath 
of  prosperity.  Neither  wars  nor  revolutions  are  likely to put Europe by the 
ears,  unless  in  consequence  of  a  general  commercial  and  industrial  crisis, 
the  signal of which has,  as usual, to be given by England, the representative 
of  European  industry  in  the  market  of  the  world. 

5 

It is  unnecessary to  dwell on the political consequences  such a crisis must 
produce  in  these  times,  with  the  unprecedented  extension  of  factories  in 
England, with the utter dissolution of her official parties, with the whole State 
10  machinery  of  France  transformed  into  one  immense  swindling  and  stock 
jobbing concern,  with Austria on the eve of bankruptcy, with wrongs every 
where  accumulated  to  be revenged  by  the  people, with the conflicting inter 
ests  of  the  reactionary  powers  themselves,  and  with  the  Russian  dream  of 
conquest  once  more  revealed  to  the  world.

Russian  Aggrandizement. 

Correspondence  of  The  N.Y.Tribune. 

London, Tuesday,  May  31,  1853. 

Admiral Corry's fleet has been seen in the Bay of Biscay on the way to Malta, 
where it is to reinforce the squadron of Admiral Dundas. The Morning Herald 
justly  observes: 

5 

"Had  Admiral  Dundas  been  permitted  to  join  the  French  squadron  at 
Salamis,  several  weeks  ago,  the  present  state  of  affairs  would be  quite  dif 
ferent." 

10 

Should  Russia  attempt,  were  it  only  for  the  salvation  of  appearances, to 
back  up  the  ridiculous  demonstrations  of  Menchikoff by  actual  maneuvers 
of  war,  her  first  two  steps  would  probably  consist  in the  re-occupation  of 
the  Danubian  principalities,  and  in  the  invasion  of  the  Armenian  province 
of  Kars  and  the  port of Batoum, territories  which  she made  every effort to  15 
secure  by  the  treaty  of  Adrianople.  The  port of  Batoum being the  only  safe 
refuge  for  ships  in  the  eastern part  of  the  Black  Sea,  its  possession  would 
deprive  Turkey  of  her  last  naval  station  in  the  Pontus  and  make  the  latter 
an  exclusively  Russian  Sea.  This  port added to  the possession of  Kars, the 
richest  and  best  cultivated  portion  of  Armenia,  would  enable Russia to cut  20 
off  the  commerce  of  England  with  Persia  by way of  Trebisond,  and  afford 
a  basis  of  operations  against the  latter power, as well as against Asia Minor. 
If,  however,  England  and  France  hold firm, Nicholas will no more carry out 
his  projects  in  that  quarter,  than  the  Empress  Catherine  carried  out  hers 
against Aga Mahmed,  when he  commanded  his  slaves to  drive the Russian  25 
Ambassador  Voinovitch  and  his  companions  with  scourges  to  their  ships, 
away  from  Asterabad. 

154 

The  Turkish  Question—"The  Times"—Russian  Aggrandizement 

In no  quarter did the latest news  create greater consternation than in Print-
ing-House-square.  The  first  attempt  made  by  The  Times to  lift  up  its  head 
under  the  terrible  blow,  was  a  desperate  diatribe  against  the  electric  tele 
graph, that "most extraordinary"  instrument.  " No correct conclusions could 
5  be  drawn," it exclaimed,  "from  that mendacious  wire." Having thus laid its 
own  incorrect  conclusions  to  the  fault  of  the  electric  wire,  The  Times, after 
the  statement  of  Ministers  in Parliament,  endeavors  now  also  to  get  rid  of 
its  ancient  "correct"  premises.  It  says: 

10 

"Whatever  may  be  the  ultimate  fate  of  the  Ottoman Empire,  or  rather  of 
that  Mohammedan  Power  which  has  ruled  it  for  four  centuries,  there  can 
be no difference of opinion between all parties in this country and in Europe, 
that  the  gradual  progress  of  the  indigenous  Christian  population  toward 
civilization and independent government is  the interest of the world, and that 
these  races of men ought never to be suffered to fall under the yoke of Russia, 
15  and to  swell her gigantic dominions. On that point we confidently hope, that 
the  resistance  offered to  these  pretensions  of Russia would be not only that 
of  Turkey,  but  of  all  Europe;  and  this  spirit of annexation and aggrandize 
ment needs but to display itself in its true  shape to excite universal antipathy 
and  an insurmountable  opposition,  in which the  Greek  and  Sclavonian  sub-
jects  of  Turkey  are  themselves  prepared  to  take  a great  part." 

20 

How  did  it  happen,  that  the  poor  Times  believed  in  the  "good  faith"  of 
Russia toward Turkey,  and her "antipathy"  against all aggrandizement? The 
good will  of Russia  toward Turkey! Peter I. proposed to raise himself on the 
ruins  of  Turkey.  Catherine  persuaded  Austria,  and  called  upon  France  to 
25 participate in the proposed dismemberment of Turkey, and the establishment 
of  a  Greek  Empire  at  Constantinople,  under  her  grandson,  who  had  been 
educated  and  even named with a view  to  this  result.  Nicholas, more moder 
ate,  only  demands  the  exclusive  Protectorate  of  Turkey.  Mankind  will  not 
forget  that  Russia  was  the  protector  oí  Poland,  the  protector  oí  the  Crimea, 
30  the  protector  of  Courland,  the  protector  oí  Georgia,  Mingrelia,  the  Circassian 
and  Caucasian  tribes.  And  now  Russia,  the  protector  of  Turkey!  As  to 
Russia's  antipathy  against  aggrandizement,  I  allege the following facts from 
a  mass  of  the  acquisitions  of  Russia  since  Peter  the  Great. 

The  Russian  frontier  has  advanced:

Toward  Teheran

Russia's  acquisitions  from  Sweden  are  greater  than what remains  of that 
40  Kingdom;  from  Poland  nearly  equal  to  the  Austrian  Empire;  from  Turkey

The Russian Humbug—Gladstone's  Failure-
Sir Charles Wood's  East Indian Reforms. 

Correspondence  of  The  N.Y.Tribune 

London,  Tuesday,  June  7,  1853. 

5  According  to  a  dispatch  from  Berne,  the  Bundesrath  has  canceled  the 
judgment  pronounced  by  the  Court  Martial  at  Fribourg  against  the  late 
insurrectionists,  ordering  them  to  be  brought  before  the  Ordinary  Courts, 
unless they  should be pardoned by the Cantonal Council. Here, then, we have 
the first of the heroic deeds accompanying the  "rupture between Switzerland 
and Austria,"  the infallible result of which I traced in a former letter on the 
European  "Model  Republic." 

10 

In  transmitting  to  you  the  news  of  the  Prussian  Government having  or 
dered  several  Artillery  officers  on  furlough  abroad to return immediately to 
their  duties,  I  stated,  by  mistake,  that  those  officers  were  engaged  in  in-
15 structing the Russian army, while I intended to have said the Turkish artillery, 

in  field-practice. 

20 

All  the  Russian  Generals,  and  other  Russians  residing  at  Paris  have  re 
ceived  orders  to  return  to  Russia  without  delay.  The  language  adopted by 
M.  de  Kisseleff,  the  Russian Envoy  at Paris,  is  rather menacing,  and letters 
from  Petersburg  are  ostentatiously  shown  by  him,  in  which  the  Turkish 
question  is  treated  assez  cavalièrement.  A  rumor  has  issued  from  the  same 
quarter,  reporting  that Russia  demands  from Persia the  cession  of the terri 
tory of Astrabad, at the  south-eastern extremity of the Caspian Sea. Russian 
merchants,  at  the  same  time,  dispatch,  or  are  reported to  have  dispatched, 
25  orders to their London agents, " n o i to press any sales of grain at the present 
juncture,  as  prices  were  expected  to  rise  in  the  imminent  eventuality  of  a 
war."  Lastly, confidential hints are being communicated to every newspaper, 

157 

Karl  Marx 

that  the  Russian  troops  are  marching  to  the  frontiers—that  the  inhabitants 
of  Jassy  are  preparing for  their reception—that the Russian Consul at Galatz 
has bought up an immense number of trees for the throwing of several bridges 
across  the  Danube,  and  other  canards,  the  breeding  of  which  has  been  so 
successfully  carried  on by  the  Augsburg Gazette and  other  Austro-Russian 
journals. 

5 

These,  and  a lot of  similar reports, communications,  etc.,  are  nothing but 
so  many  ridiculous  attempts  on  the  part  of  the  Russian  agents  to  strike  a 
wholesome  terror  into  the  western world,  and to push it to  the  continuance 
of  that  policy  of  extension,  under  the  cover  of  which  Russia  hopes,  as  10 
heretofore, to  carry  out  her projects upon the East. How  systematically this 
game  of  mystification  is  being  played,  may  be  seen  from  the  following: 

Last week,  several  French papers  notoriously  in the  pay  of  Russia, made 
the  discovery,  that  the  "real  question was  less  between Russia  and Turkey 
than  between  Petersburg  and  Moscow—i.e.  between  the  Czar  and  the  Old  15 
Russian  party;  and that for  the  autocrat,  there  would be  less  danger in war, 
than  in  the  vengeance  of  that  conquest-urging  party,  which  has  so  often 
shown  how  it  deals  with  monarchs  that  displease  it." 

Prince  Menchikoff,  of  course,  is  the  "head  of  this  party."  The  Times and 
most  of  the  English  papers  did  not fail to reproduce this  absurd  statement,  20 
the one in consciousness of its meaning; the others, perhaps, its unconscious 
dupes.  Now, what conclusion was the public intended to draw from this novel 
revelation?  That  Nicholas,  in  retreating  under  ridicule,  and  abandoning bis 
warlike  attitude  against  Turkey,  has  won  a  victory  over  his  own  warlike 
Old-Russians,  or  that  Nicholas,  in actually going to war, only does  so from  25 
the  necessity of yielding to that (fabulous) party.  At all events,  "there would 
only  be  a  victory  of  Moscow  over  Petersburg,  or  of  Petersburg  over Mos 
cow;"  and,  consequently,  none  of Europe  over  Russia. 

Respecting this famous  Old-Russian party,  I happen to  know from  several 
well-informed Russians, aristocrats themselves, with whom I have had much  30 
intercourse  at  Paris,  that it has long been entirely extinct,  and is  only occa 
sionally  called  back into  apparent  existence,  when  the Czar  stands  in need 
of  some  bugbear  to  frighten  the  West of Europe  into  passive  endurance of 
his  arrogant  claims.  Hence  the  resurrection  of  a  Menchikoff,  and  his  ap 
propriate  outfit  in  the  fabulous  Old-Russian  style.  There  is  but  one  party  35 
among the  Russian nobles  actually feared  by the Czar—the party whose  aim 
is  the  establishment  of  an  aristocratico-constitutional  system,  after  the 
pattern  of  England. 

Besides  these  different  spectres  conjured  up  by  Russian  diplomacy,  for 
the misguidance  of England  and  France,  another  attempt to bring about the  40 
same  result has  just been made, by the  publication of  a work entitled,  L 'Em-

158 

The  Russian  Humbug—Gladstone's  Failure—Sir  Charles  Wood's  East  Indian  Reforms 

pire  Russe  depuis  le  Congrès  de  Vienne,  by  Viscount  de  Beaumont-Vassy. 
It will be sufficient to extract one sentence only, for thé purpose of character 
ising  this  opusculum: 

5 

"It  is  well  known  that  a  deposit  of  coin  and  ingots  exists  in the  cellar of 
the  fortress  of  St.  Peter  and  St.  Paul.  This  hidden  treasure  was  officially 
estimated,  on  the  1st of  January,  1850,  at  99,763,361  silver rubles." 

Has  any  one  ever  presumed  to  speak  of  the  hidden  treasure in the  Bank 
of  England?  The  "hidden  treasure"  of  Russia  is  simply  the  metal  reserve 
balancing  a  three  times  larger  circulation  of  convertible notes,  not  to  speak 
1 o of the hidden amount of inconvertible paper issued by the Imperial Treasury. 
But,  perhaps,  this  treasure  may  yet  be  called  a  "hidden" one, inasmuch as 
nobody  has  ever  seen  it,  except  the  few  Petersburg  merchants  selected  by 
the Czar's  Government for the annual inspection of the bags which hide it. 

15 

The  chief  demonstration of  Russia in this direction is, however, an article 
published  in  the  Journal des Débats, and signed by M.  de  St.-Marc Girardin, 
that  old  Orleanist  sage.  I  extract: 

20 

"Europe  has  two  great perils, according to us: Russia, which menaces her 
independence;  and  the  Revolution,  which  menaces  her  social  order.  Now, 
she  cannot  be  saved  from  one  of  these  perils  except  by  exposing  herself 
entirely to the other. Does Europe believe that the knot of her independence, 
and  especially  of  the  independence  of  the  Continent,  is  at  Constantinople, 
and that it is there that the question must be boldly decided; then, that is war 
against  Russia.  In  that  war  France  and  England would  struggle  to  establish 
the  independence  of  Europe.  What would  Germany  do?  We know not.  But 
25  what  we  know  is,  that  in  the  present  state  of  Europe,  war  would  be  the  social 

revolution." 

As a matter of course, M.  de St.-Marc Girardin concludes in favor of peace 
on any  condition  against the  social revolution,  forgetting,  however,  that the 
Emperor  of  Russia  has,  at least,  as  much "horreur" of the revolution as  he 

30  himself and his  proprietor,  M. Bertin. 

Notwithstanding  all  these  soporifics,  administered by Russian diplomacy 
to  the  Press  and people  of  England,  "that old and obstinate"  Aberdeen has 
been compelled to order Admiral Dundas to join the French fleet on the coast 
of  Turkey,  and  even  The  Times,  which,  during  the  last  few  months,  knew 
35  only  how  to  write  Russian,  seems  to  have  received  a  more  English  in 

spiration.  It  talks  now  very  big. 

The  Danish  (once  Schleswig-Holstein)  question  is  beginning  to  create 
considerable  interest  in England,  since the  English Press, too,  has  at length 
discovered  that  it  involves  the  same  principle  of  Russian  extension,  as 
40 supplies the foundation of the Eastern complication. Mr. Urquhart, M.P., the 
well-known  admirer  of  Turkey  and  Eastern  Institutions,  has  published  a 

159 

Karl Marx 

pamphlet  on  the  Danish  Succession,  of  which  an  account  will  be  given in 
a future  letter.  The  chief  argument put forward in this publication is that the 
Sound  is  intended  by  Russia  to  perform  the  same  functions  for  her  in  the 
North  as  the  Dardanelles  in  the  South,  viz.,  the  securing  her  maritime  su 
premacy  over  the  Baltic,  in  the  same  manner  as  the  occupation  of  the 
Dardanelles  would  do  with  regard  to  the  Euxine.

Some  time  since  I gave  you my opinion that the rate of interest would rise 
in  England,  and  that  such  an  occurrence  would have  an unfavorable  effect 
on  Mr. Gladstone's  financial  projects.  Now,  the  minimum  rate  of  discount 
has in the past week been actually raised by the Bank of England from 3 per  10 
cent,  to  3V2 per cent., and the failure I predicted for Mr. Gladstone's  scheme 
of conversion  has  become  already a fact, as you may  see from the following 
statement: 

Bank of England, Thursday,  June  2,1853. 

Amount of new stock accepted until this day: 
372 per cent 
27z per cent

South  Sea House, Thursday, June 2,1853. 

Amount of convertible annuities till this  day:

5,270 18s 4d 
£1,059,303  16s 7d 

15 

20 

25 

Thus,  of  the whole  amount of South Sea annuities offered for conversion, 
only one-eighth has been taken, and of the twenty millions new stock created 
by  Mr. Gladstone,  only  one-twelfth  has  been  accepted.  Mr. Gladstone will, 
therefore, be obliged to contract for a loan  at a time when the rate  of interest 
has  increased  and  will  most  likely  continue  to  increase,  which  loan  must  30 
amount  to £8,157,811.  Failure!  The  saving  of £100,000  anticipated from this 
conversion,  and  already placed to the credit of the Budget, has, accordingly, 
to  be  dispensed with.  Respecting the great bulk of the Public Debt,  viz:  the 
£500,000,000  of  3  per  cents,  Mr. Gladstone  has  obtained,  as  the  only result 
of  his  financial  experiment, that another year will have  elapsed on the  10th  35 
of  Oct.,  1853,  during  which  he  has  been  unable  to  give  notice  of  any  con 
version.  The greatest mischief, however, is this, that £3,116,000 must be paid 
in  money in a few  days  to  holders  of  Exchequer  Bills,  who  refuse  to  renew 
them  on  the  terms  offered  by  Mr. Gladstone.  Such  is  the  financial  success 
of the  Government of  "all the talents."

The  Russian  Humbug—Gladstone's  Failure—Sir Charles Wood's  East Indian  Reforms 

Lord John Russell, in the debate on the Ecclesiastical Revenues of Ireland, 

(House  of  Commons,  31st  ult.,)  expressed  himself  as  follows: 

5 

"It has  been evident,  of  late  years, that the Roman Catholic Clergy—look 
ing  to  its  proceedings  in  this  country—looking  to  that  church  acting  under 
the  direction  of  its  head,  who  himself  a  foreign  sovereign,  has  aimed  at 
political power,  (hear!  hear!) which appears to  me to be at variance with the 
due  attachment  to  the  Crown  of  this  country,  (hear!  hear!)—with  the  due 
attachment  to  the  general  cause  of  liberty—with  the  due  attachment  to  the 
duties  a subject of the State should perform toward it—now, as I wish to  speak 
10  with  as  much frankness  as the honorable gentleman who  spoke last, let me 
not  be  misunderstood  in  this  House.  I  am  far  from  denying  that  there  are 
many  members  of  this  House,  and  many  members  of  the  Roman  Catholic 
persuasion,  both  in  this  country  and  in  Ireland,  who  are  attached  to  the 
Throne,  and  to  the  liberties  of  this  country; but what  I  am  saying,  and that 
15  of which I am convinced, is, that if the Roman Catholic clergy had increased 
power  given  to  them,  and  if  they,  as  ecclesiastics,  were  to  exercise greater 
control  and  greater  political  influence  than  they  do  now, that power would 
not  be  exercised  in  accordance  with the general freedom that prevails  in  this 
country—(Hurrah!)—and  that  neither  in  respect  of  political  power,  nor upon 
20  other  subjects,  would  they  favor  that  general  freedom  of  discussion  and  that 
activity  and  energy  of  the  human  mind,  that  belongs  to  the  spirit  of  the 
constitution  of  this  country.  (Flourish  of  trumpets!)  I  do  not  think  that,  in 
that  respect,  they  are  upon  a  par  with  the  Presbyterians  of  Scotland,  (bag 
pipes!)  the  Wesleyans  of  this  country,  and  the  Established  Church  of  this 
country.  (General  rapture.)  . ..  I  am  obliged,  then  to  conclude,  most  un 
willingly to conclude, but most decidedly, that the endowment of the Roman 
Catholic Religion in Ireland, in the place of the endowment of the Protestant 
Church in  that country,  in  connection  with the  State,  is  not  an object which 
the  Parliament  of  this  country ought  to  adopt  or  to  sanction." 

25 

30 

Two  days  after  this  speech of  Lord  John,  in which  he  attempted for the 
six-thousandth  time,  to  make  a  show  of  his  love  of  "general  freedom,"  by 
his  zealous  genuflexions  before  particular  sects  of  Protestant  bigotry, 
Messrs.  Sadleir,  Keogh,  and Monsell gave in their resignations to the Coali 
tion  Ministry,  in  a  letter  addressed  by  Mr. Monsell  to  My  Lord  Aberdeen. 
35  My  Lord  Aberdeen  in  his  answer  dated  3d June,  assures  these  gentlemen 

that 

"The reasons given by Lord John Russell and the  sentiments of which you 
Lord John 
complain, are not shared by me, nor by many of my colleagues 
Russell desires me to  say, that he did not impute want of loyalty to the Roman 

40  Catholics." 

Messrs.  Sadleir,  Keogh  and  Monsell  accordingly withdrew  their resigna-

161 

Karl  Marx 

tions,  and  the  arrangements  for a general reconciliation passed off last night 
in  Parliament,  "to  the  greatest  satisfaction  of  Lord  John  Russell." 

5 

10 

The last India Bill of  1783 proved fatal to the Coalition Cabinet of Mr. Fox 
and  Lord  North.  The  new  India Bill  of  1853  is  likely  to  prove  fatal for the 
Coalition Cabinet of Mr. Gladstone and Lord John Russell.  But if the former 
were  thrown  overboard,  because  of  their  attempt to  abolish  the  Courts  of 
Directors  and  of  Proprietors,  the  latter  are threatened with a similar fate for 
the  opposite reason.  On June 3,  Sir Charles  Wood moved for leave to bring 
in  a bill to  provide  for  the  Government of  India.  Sir Charles commenced by 
excusing the  anomalous length of the speech he was about to deliver, by the 
"magnitude  of  the  subject,"  and  "the  150,000,000  of  souls  he  had  to  deal 
with."  For  every  30,000,000  of his fellow-subjects,  Sir Charles could do  no 
less  than  sacrifice  one  hour's  breath.  But why this  precipitate  legislation on 
that  "great  subject,"  while  you  postpone  it  "for  even  the  most  trifling 
matters?"  Because  the  Charter  of  the  East India Company  expires  on the  15 
30th  April,  1854.  But  why  not  pass  a temporary continuance bill,  reserving 
to  future  discussion  more  permanent  legislation?  Because  it  cannot  be 
expected that we  shall ever find again "such an opportunity of dealing quietly 
with this  vast and  important question"—i.e.,  of  burking  it in a Parliamentary 
way.  Besides, we  are fully informed on the matter, the Directors of the East  20 
India  Company  express  the  opinion  that  it  is  necessary  to  legislate  in  the 
course  of  the  present  session,  and  the  Governor-General  of  India,  Lord 
Dalhousie,  summons  the  Government  by  an  express  letter  by  all  means  to 
conclude  our  legislation at once.  But the  most  striking  argument  wherewith 
Sir  Charles  justifies  his  immediate  legislation  is  that,  prepared  as  he  may  25 
appear  to  speak  of  a  world  of  questions,  "not  comprised  in  the  bill  he 
proposed  to  bring  in,"  the  "measure  which  he  has  to  submit  is,  so  far  as 
legislation  goes,  comprised in  a  very small  compass."  After  this introduction 
Sir  Charles  delivered  himself  of  an  apology  for  the  administration of  India 
for the last twenty years.  "We must look at India with somewhat of an Indian  30 
eye"—which Indian eye  seems to  have the particular gift of seeing everything 
bright on the  part  of  England  and  everything black on the  side  of  India.  "In 
India  you  have  a  race  of  people  slow  of  change,  bound  up  by  religious 
prejudices  and antiquated customs.  There  are, in fact,  all obstacles to rapid 
progress." (Perhaps  there is  a Whig Coalition party in India.) "The points,"  35 
said  Sir  Charles  Wood,  "upon  which  the  greatest  stress  has  been  laid,  and 
which  are  the  heads  of  the  complaints  contained  in the petitions presented 
to  the  Committee,  relate  to the  administration  of justice,  the  want  of public 
works, and the tenure of land." With regard to the Public Works, the Govern 
ment intends to undertake some of "the greatest magnitude and importance." 
With regard  to  the tenure of lands,  Sir Charles proves very successfully that 

40 

162 

ψ" 

The  Russian  Humbug—Gladstone's  Failure—Sir Charles Wood's  East Indian  Reforms 

its  three  existing  forms—the  Zemindary,  the  Ryotwari,  and  the  Village 
systems—are  only  so  many  forms  of  fiscal  exploitation  in  the  hands  of  the 
Company,  none  of  which  could  well  be  made  general,  nor  deserved  to  be 
made  so.  An  idea  of  establishing  another  form,  of  an  altogether  opposite 
5  character,  does  not  in  the  least  preoccupy  the  mind  of  Sir  Charles.  "With 
regard  to  the  administration  of  justice,"  continues  he,  " t he  complaints  relate 
principally  to  the  inconvenience  arising  from  the  technicalities  of  English 
law,  to  the  alleged  incompetency  of  English  judges,  and  to  the  corruption 
of the native  officers  and judges."  And now, in order to prove the hard labor 
10  of providing for the administration of justice in India, Sir Charles relates that 
already,  as  early  as  1833,  a  Law  Commission  was  appointed  in  India.  But 
in  what  manner  did  this  Commission  act,  according  to  Sir  Charles  Wood's 
own  testimony?  The  first  and  last  result  of  the  labors  of  that  Commission 
was  a  penal  code,  prepared  under  the  auspices  of  Mr.Macaulay.  This  code 
15  was  sent  to  the  various  local  authorities  in  India,  which  sent  it  back  to 
Calcutta,  from  which  it  was  sent  to  England,  to  be  again  returned  from 
England to  India.  In India,  Mr. Macaulay having been replaced as legislative 
counsel  by  Mr. Bethune,  the  code  was  totally  altered,  and  on  this  plea  the 
Governor-General,  not  being  then  of  opinion  "that  delay  is  a  source  of 
20  weakness  and  danger,"  sent  it  back  to  England,  and  from  England  it  was 
returned  to  the  Governor-General,  with authority to pass the code in what­
ever shape he thought best. But now, Mr. Bethune having died, the Governor-
General  thought  best  to  submit  the  code  to  a  third  English  lawyer,  and  to 
a  lawyer  who  knew  nothing  about  the  habits  and  customs  of  the  Hindoos, 
reserving himself the  right  of afterward rejecting a code concocted by wholly 
incompetent  authority.  Such  have  been  the  adventures  of  that  yet  unborn 
code.  As  to  the  technical  absurdities  of  the  law  in  India,  Sir  Charles  takes 
his  stand  on  the  no  less  absurd  technicalities  of  the  English law-procedure 
itself;  but  while  affirming  the  perfect  incorruptibility  of  the  English  judges 
in  India,  he  nevertheless  is  ready  to  sacrifice  them  by  an  alteration  in  the 
manner  of  nominating them.  The  general progress  of India is  demonstrated 
by  a  comparison  of  the  present  state  of  Delhi  with  that  under  the  invasion 
of  Khuli-Khan.  The  salt-tax  is  justified  by  the  arguments  of  the  most  re­
nowned  political  economists,  all  of  whom  have  advised  taxation  to  be  laid 
35  on  some  article  of  first  necessity.  But  Sir  Charles  does  not add what those 
same  economists  would  have  said,  on  finding  that  in  the  two  years  from 
1849—'50,  and  1851—52,  there  had  been  a  decrease  in  the  consumption  of 
salt,  of  60,000  tuns,  a  loss  of  revenue  to  the  amount  of  £415,000,  the  total 
salt revenue  amounting to £2,000,000. The measures proposed by Sir Charles, 

25 

30 

40  and  "comprised  in  a  very  small  compass,"  are: 

1.  The  Court  of  Directors,  to  consist  of  eighteen  instead  of  twenty 

163 

Karl Marx 

four  members,  twelve  to  be  elected  by  the  Proprietors,  and  six  by  the 
Crown. 

2.  The  revenue  of  Directors  to  be  raised  from  £300  to  £500  a  year,  the 

Chairman  to  receive  £1,000. 

3.  All  the  ordinary appointments  in the  civil  service,  and  all  the  scientific 
in  the  military  service  of  India,  to  be  thrown  open  to  public  competition, 
leaving  to  the  Directors  the  nomination  to  the  Cadetships  in  the  Cavalry-
of-the-Line. 

5 

4.  The  Governor-Generalship  to  be  separated  from  the  Governorship  of 
Bengal,  and  power  to  be  given  to  the  Supreme  Government to  constitute  a 
new  Presidency  in  the  districts  on  the  Indus. 

10 

5.  And  lastly,  the  whole  of  this  measure  only  to  continue  until  the  Parlia­

ment  shall  provide  otherwise. 

The  speech  and  measure  of  Sir  Charles  Wood  was  subjected  to  a  very 
strong  and  satirical  criticism  by  Mr. Bright,  whose  picture  of  India  ruined 
by  the  fiscal  exertions  of  the  Company  and  Government  did  not,  of course, 
receive  the  supplement  of  India  ruined  by  Manchester  and  Free  Trade.  As 
to  last  night's  speech  of  an  Old  East-Indiaman,  Sir  J.Hogg,  Director  or 
ex-Director  of  the  Company,  I  really  suspect  that  I  have  met with it already 
in  1701,  1730,  1743,  1769,  1772,  1781,  1783,  1784,  1793,  1813,  etc.,  and  am  20 
induced,  by  way  of  answer  to  his  directorial  panegyric,  to  quote  merely  a 
few  facts  from  the  annual  Indian  accounts  published,  I  believe,  under  his 
own  superintendence.

Telegraphic  dispatches  from  Vienna  announce  that  the  pacific  solution  of 
the  Turkish,  Sardinian  and  Swiss  questions,  is  regarded  there  as  a  cer- 
tainty.

Last  night  the  debate  on India was  continued  in the  House  of  Commons, 
in the usual dull  manner.  Mr. Blackett charged the statements of Sir Charles 
Wood  and  Sir  J. Hogg  with  bearing  the  stamp  of  optimist  falsehood.  A  lot 
of  Ministerial  and Directorial advocates rebuked the charge as well as they  10 
could,  and  the  inevitable  Mr. Hume  summed  up  by  calling  on  Ministers  to 
withdraw  their  bill.  Debate  adjourned. 

Hindostán  is  an  Italy  of  Asiatic  dimensions, the  Himalayas for the Alps, 
the  Plains  of  Bengal  for the  Plains  of  Lombardy, the  Deccan  for the  Apen 
nines,  and  the  Isle of Ceylon for the  Island of Sicily.  The  same rich variety  15 
in  the  products  of  the  soil,  and  the  same  dismemberment  in  the  political 
configuration.  Just  as  Italy  has, from  time  to  time, been compressed  by the 
conqueror's  sword into  different  national  masses,  so  do  we find Hindostán, 
when  not  under  the  pressure  of  the  Mohammedan,  or  the  Mogul,  or  the 
Briton,  dissolved  into  as  many  independent  and  conflicting  States  as  it  20 
numbered  towns, or even villages.  Yet, in a  social point of view, Hindostán 
is  not  the  Italy,  but  the  Ireland  of  the  East.  And this  strange  combination 
of  Italy and of Ireland, of a world of voluptuousness  and of a world of woes, 
is  anticipated  in  the  ancient  traditions  of  the  religion  of  Hindostán.  That 
religion  is  at  once  a  religion  of  sensualist  exuberance,  and  a  religion  of  25 
self-torturing  asceticism; a religion of the Lingam and of the Juggernaut; the 
religion  of  the  Monk,  and  of  the  Bayadere.

I  share  not the  opinion of those who believe in a golden age of Hindostán, 
without  recurring,  however,  like  Sir  Charles  Wood, for the confirmation of 
my  view,  to  the  authority  of  Khuli-Khan.  But take,  for example, the times 
"  of  Aurung-Zebe;  or the  epoch, when the  Mogul appeared in the North,  and 
the  Portuguese  in  the  South;  or  the  age  of  Mohammedan invasion,  and  of 
the  Heptarchy  in  Southern  India;  or,  if  you  will,  go  still  more  back to  an 
tiquity,  take  the  mythological  chronology  of  the  Brahman  himself,  who 
places  the  commencement  of  Indian  misery  in  an epoch even  more  remote 
than  the  Christian  creation  of  the  world. 

10 

There  cannot, however, remain any doubt but that the misery inflicted by 
the  British  on  Hindostán  is  of  an  essentially  different  and  infinitely  more 
intensive  kind  than  all  Hindostán  had  to  suffer  before.  I  do  not  allude  to 
European  despotism,  planted  upon  Asiatic  despotism,  by  the  British  East 
India  Company,  forming  a  more  monstrous  combination  than  any  of  the 
15  divine monsters  startling us in the Temple of Salsette.  This is no distinctive 
feature  of  British  Colonial  rule,  but  only  an  imitation  of  the Dutch,  and  so 
much  so  that  in  order  to  characterise  the  working of the British East India 
Company,  it  is  sufficient  to  literally  repeat  what  Sir  Stamford  Raffles,  the 
English  Governor  of  Java,  said  of  the  old  Dutch  East  India  Company: 

20 

"The  Dutch  Company,  actuated  solely by  the  spirit of gain, and viewing 
their  subjects,  with  less  regard  or  consideration than  a  West  India  planter 
formerly  viewed  a  gang  upon  his  estate,  because  the  latter  had  paid  the 
purchase  money  of  human property,  which the  other had not,  employed  all 
the  pre-existing  machinery  of  despotism  to  squeeze  from  the  people  their 
25 utmost mite of contribution, the last dregs of their labor, and thus aggravated 
the evils of a capricious  and semi-barbarous Government, by working it with 
all the practised ingenuity of politicians, and all the monopolizing selfishness 
of  traders." 

AH  the  civil  wars,  invasions,  revolutions,  conquests,  famines,  strangely 
30  complex,  rapid,  and  destructive  as  the  successive action in Hindostán may 
appear,  did  not  go  deeper  than  its  surface.  England  has  broken  down  the 
entire framework of Indian society, without any  symptoms of reconstitution 
yet appearing.  This  loss  of his  old  world, with no gain of a new one, imparts 
a  particular  kind  of  melancholy  to  the  present  misery  of  the  Hindoo,  and 
separates  Hindostán,  ruled  by  Britain,  from  all  its  ancient  traditions,  and 
from  the  whole  of  its  past  history. 

35 

There  have  been  in  Asia,  generally,  from  immemorial  times,  but  three 
departments  of  Government;  that  of  Finance,  or the plunder of the interior; 
that  of  War,  or  the  plunder  of  the  exterior;  and,  finally,  the  department of 
40  Public  Works.  Climate  and territorial  conditions,  especially the  vast tracts 
of  desert,  extending  from  the  Sahara,  through  Arabia,  Persia,  India,  and 

169 

Karl Marx 

Tartary,  to  the  most  elevated  Asiatic  highlands,  constituted  artificial  ir 
rigation by  canals  and  water-works  the  basis  of  Oriental  agriculture.  As in 
Egypt and India, inundations  are used for fertilizing the soil in Mesopotamia, 
Persia,  etc.;  advantage  is  taken  of  a high level for feeding irrigative  canals. 
This  prime  necessity of  an economical and common use  of water, which, in 
the  Occident,  drove  private  enterprise  to  voluntary association,  as  in Flan 
ders  and Italy, necessitated, in the  Orient where civilization was too low and 
the  territorial  extent  too  vast  to  call  into  life  voluntary  association,  the 
interference  of the  centralizing power of  Government.  Hence an economical 
function  devolved  upon  all  Asiatic  Governments  the  function of providing  10 
public  works.  This  artificial fertilization  of  the  soil,  dependent on  a Central 
Government,  and  immediately  decaying  with  the  neglect  of  irrigation  and 
drainage,  explains the otherwise  strange fact that we now find whole territo 
ries barren and desert that were once brilliantly cultivated, as Palmyra, Petra, 
the  ruins  in  Yemen,  and  large  provinces  of  Egypt,  Persia,  and  Hindostán;  15 
it also  explains  how  a  single war  of devastation has been able to depopulate 
a  country  for  centuries,  and  to  strip  it  of  all  its  civilization. 

5 

Now,  the  British  in  East  India  accepted  from  their  predecessors  the 
department  of  finance  and  of  war,  but  they  have  neglected  entirely  that  of 
public works.  Hence the deterioration of an agriculture which is not capable  20 
of  being  conducted  on  the  British  principle  of  free  competition,  of  laissez-
faire and laissez-aller. But in Asiatic empires we  are  quite  accustomed to see 
agriculture  deteriorating  under  one  government  and  reviving  again  under 
some  other  government.  There  the  harvests  correspond  to  good  or  bad 
government,  as  they  change  in  Europe  with good or bad seasons. Thus the  25 
oppression and  neglect of  agriculture,  bad  as  it is,  could not be looked upon 
as  the  final  blow  dealt  to  Indian  society  by  the  British  intruder,  had  it  not 
been  attended  by  a circumstance  of  quite  different importance, a novelty in 
the  annals of the whole Asiatic world.  However changing the political aspect 
of India's past must appear, its  social condition has remained unaltered since  30 
its  remotest  antiquity,  until  the  first  decennium  of  the  19th  century.  The 
hand-loom  and  the  spinning-wheel,  producing their  regular  myriads of  spin 
ners  and  weavers,  were  the  pivots  of  the  structure  of  that  society.  From 
immemorial  times,  Europe  received  the  admirable  textures  of  Indian labor, 
sending  in  return  for  them  her  precious  metals,  and  furnishing  thereby  his  35 
material  to  the  goldsmith,  that  indispensable  member  of  Indian  society, 
whose love of finery is so great that even the lowest class, those who go about 
nearly naked, have commonly a pair of golden ear-rings and a gold ornament 
of  some kind hung round their necks. Rings on the fingers and toes have also 
been common. Women as well as children frequently wore massive bracelets 40 
and  anklets  of  gold  or  silver,  and  statuettes  of  divinities  in gold  and  silver 

170 

The  British  Rule  in  India 

were  met  with  in  the  households.  It  was  the  British intruder who  broke  up 
the Indian hand-loom and destroyed the spinning-wheel. England begun with 
driving the Indian cottons from the European market; it then introduced twist 
into  Hindostán,  and in the  end inundated the  very mother country of cotton 
5  with  cottons.  From  1818  to  1836  the  export of  twist from  Great  Britain to 
India rose in the proportion of 1 to 5,200. In 1824 the export of British muslins 
to  India  hardly  amounted  to  1,000,000  yards,  while  in  1837  it  surpassed 
64,000,000  of yards. But at the  same time the population of Dacca decreased 
from  150,000  inhabitants to  20,000.  This  decline  of Indian towns  celebrated 
for their fabrics  was by no  means the worst consequence.  British steam and 
science  uprooted,  over  the  whole  surface  of  Hindostán,  the  union between 
agricultural  and  manufacturing  industry. 

10 

These  two  circumstances—the  Hindoo,  on the  one  hand,  leaving,  like  all 
Oriental  peoples,  to  the  central  government  the  care  of  the  great  public 
15  works,  the  prime  condition of  his  agriculture  and commerce, dispersed, on 
the  other  hand,  over  the  surface  of  the country,  and agglomerated in  small 
centers  by  the  domestic  union  of  agricultural  and  manufacturing pursuits— 
these two circumstances had brought about, since the remotest times, a social 
system  of  particular  features—the  so-called  v i l l a g e - s y s t e m,  which  gave 
to each of these small unions their independent organization and distinct life. 
The  peculiar  character  of  this  system  may  be  judged  from  the  following 
description,  contained  in  an  old  official  report  of  the  British  House  of 
Commons  on  Indian  affairs: 

20 

"A  village,  geographically  considered,  is  a  tract  of  country  comprising 
25 some hundred or thousand acres of arable and waste lands ; politically viewed 
it resembles  a corporation or  township.  Its  proper  establishment of officers 
and  servants  consists  of  the  following  descriptions:  The  potail,  or  head 
inhabitant, who has generally the superintendence of the affairs of the village, 
settles  the  disputes  of  the  inhabitants,  attends  to  the  police,  and  performs 
30 the duty of collecting the revenue within his village, a duty which his personal 
influence  and  minute  acquaintance  with  the  situation  and  concerns  of  the 
people  render  him  the  best  qualified  for  this  charge.  The  kurnum  keeps  the 
accounts of cultivation, and registers everything connected with it. The  tallier 
and the  totie, the duty of the former of which consists in gaining information 
35  of  crimes  and  offenses,  and  in  escorting  and  protecting  persons  traveling 
from  one  village  to  another; the  province  of  the  latter  appearing to  be more 
immediately confined to the village, consisting, among other duties, in guard 
ing  the  crops  and  assisting  in  measuring  them.  The  boundary-man,  who 
preserves the limits of the village, or gives evidence respecting them in cases 
40  of  dispute.  The  Superintendent of  Tanks  and  Watercourses  distributes the 
water for the purposes of agriculture. The Brahmin, who performs the village 

171 

Karl  Marx 

worship. The  schoolmaster, who is  seen teaching the  children in a village to 
read  and  write  in  the  sand.  The calendar bralimin,  or  astrologer,  etc.  These 
officers  and  servants  generally constitute  the establishment of a village; but 
in  some  parts  of  the  country  it  is  of  less  extent,  some  of  the  duties  and 
functions  above  described  being  united  in  the  same  person;  in  others  it 
exceeds  the  above-named  number  of  individuals.  Under this  simple form of 
municipal  government,  the  inhabitants  of  the  country  have  lived from  time 
immemorial.  The  boundaries  of  the  villages  have  been  but  seldom altered; 
and  though  the  villages  themselves  have  been  sometimes  injured,  and  even 
desolated by war, famine or disease, the same name, the same limits, the same 10 
interests,  and  even  the  same  families  have  continued  for  ages.  The  in 
habitants  gave  themselves  no  trouble  about  the  breaking  up  and  divisions 
of  kingdoms;  while  the  village  remains  entire, they care  not to what power 
it  is  transferred,  or  to  what  sovereign  it  devolves;  its  internal  economy 
remains  unchanged.  The potail  is  still  the  head  inhabitant,  and  still  acts  as  15 
the  petty  judge  or  magistrate,  and  collector  or  renter  of  the  village." 

5 

These  small  stereotype  forms  of  social  organism  have  been to the greater 
part  dissolved,  and  are  disappearing,  not  so  much  through the brutal inter 
ference  of  the  British  tax-gatherer  and the  British  soldier,  as to the working 
of  English  steam  and  English  free  trade.  Those  family-communities  were  20 
based  on  domestic  industry,  in that  peculiar  combination of  hand-weaving, 
hand-spinning  and  hand-tilling  agriculture  which gave  them  self-supporting 
power.  English interference having placed the  spinner  in Lancashire and the 
weaver  in  Bengal,  or  sweeping  away  both  Hindoo  spinner  and  weaver, 
dissolved these  small  semi-barbarian,  semi-civilized communities, by blow-  25 
ing  up their  economical basis,  and thus  produced the  greatest,  and to  speak 
the  truth,  the  only  social revolution  ever  heard  of  in  Asia. 

Now,  sickening  as  it  must  be  to  human feeling  to  witness  those  myriads 
of  industrious  patriarchal  and  inoffensive  social  organizations  disorganized 
and dissolved into their units, thrown into a sea of woes, and their individual  30 
members  losing  at the  same  time their ancient form of civilization, and their 
hereditary means  of  subsistence, we must not forget that these idyllic village-
communities, inoffensive though they  may appear, had always been the solid 
foundation of Oriental despotism, that they restrained the human mind within 
the  smallest possible compass, making it the unresisting tool of superstition,  35 
enslaving it  beneath traditional rules, depriving it of all grandeur and histori 
cal  energies.  We must not forget the barbarian egotism which, concentrating 
on  some miserable patch of  land,  had  quietly witnessed the ruin of empires, 
the  perpetration  of unspeakable  cruelties,  the massacre of the population of 
large towns, with no other consideration bestowed upon them than on natural 40 
events,  itself  the  helpless  prey of  any aggressor who  deigned  to  notice  it at 

172 

The  British  Rule  in  India 

all.  We  must not forget that this undignified,  stagnatory, and vegetative life, 
that  this  passive  sort  of  existence  evoked  on  the  other  part,  in  contradis 
tinction, wild, aimless, unbounded forces of destruction and rendered murder 
itself  a religious  rite  in  Hindostán.  We  must not forget that these  little com 
munities were contaminated by distinctions of caste and by slavery, that they 
subjugated  man  to  external  circumstances  instead  of  elevating  man  the 
sovereign  of  circumstances,  that  they  transformed  a  self-developing  social 
state  into  never changing natural  destiny,  and thus brought about a brutaliz 
ing  worship  of  nature,  exhibiting  its  degradation  in  the  fact  that  man,  the 
sovereign  of  nature,  fell  down  on  his  knees  in  adoration  of  Hanuman,  the 
monkey,  and  Sabbala,  the  cow. 

England, it is true, in causing a social revolution in Hindostán, was actuated 
only by the  vilest interests,  and was  stupid in her manner of enforcing them. 
But  that  is  not  the  question.  The  question is,  can mankind fulfil its  destiny 
without a fundamental revolution in the  social  state of Asia? If not, whatever 
may have been the crimes of England she was the unconscious tool of history 
in  bringing  about  that  revolution. 

Then,  whatever  bitterness  the  spectacle  of  the  crumbling  of  an  ancient 
world  may  have  for  our  personal  feelings,  we  have  the  right,  in  point  of 
history,  to  exclaim  with  Goethe: 

"Sollte  diese  Qual  uns  quälen 
Da  sie  unsre  Lust  vermehrt, 
Hat  nicht  Myriaden  Seelen 
Timur's  Herrschaft  aufgezehrt?" 

Karl  Marx.

the  increase  to  continue  at the  same  rate,  the total exports  of Great Britain 
would  amount,  at the  close  of  1853,  to  more  than  £100,000,000. 

The  Times,  in  communicating these  startling items  to  its readers, indulged 
in  a  kind  of  dithyrambics,  concluding  with the  words:  "We  are  all happy,  15 
and  all  united."  This  agreeable  discovery  had  no  sooner  been  trumpeted 
forth,  than  an  almost general  system  of  strikes burst over the whole  surface 
of England,  particularly in the  industrial North, giving  a  strange  echo to the 
song  of  harmony  tuned  by  The  Times.  These  strikes  are  the  necessary 
consequence of a comparative decrease in the labor-surplus, coinciding with 20 
a  general  rise  in  the  prices  of  the  first  necessaries.  5,000  hands  struck  at 
Liverpool, 35,000 at Stockport, and  so on, until at length the very police force 
was  seized by  the  epidemic,  and  250  constables  at Manchester offered their 
resignation.  On this  occasion the middle-class press, for instance  The Globe, 
lost  all  countenance,  and  foreswore  its  usual  philanthropic  effusions.  It  25 
calumniated,  injured,  threatened,  and  called loudly upon the magistrates for 
interference,  a  thing  which has  actually been  done at Liverpool in all cases

where  the remotest legal pretext could be invoked. These magistrates, when 
not themselves  manufacturers or traders, as is commonly the case in Lanca 
shire  and  Yorkshire,  are  at  least  intimately connected with,  and dependant 
on,  the  commercial  interest.  They  have  permitted  manufacturers  to  escape 
from  the  Ten-Hours  Act,  to  evade  the  Truck  Act,  and  to  infringe  with 
impunity  all  other  acts  passed  expressly  against the  "unadorned"  rapacity 
of  the  manufacturer, while they interpret the Combination Act always in the 
most  prejudiced  and  most  unfavorable  manner  for the  workingman.  These 
same  "gallant"  free-traders,  renowned  for  their  indefatigability  in  de-
10  nouncing government interference, these apostles of the bourgeois doctrine 
of  laissez-faire, who  profess to leave everything and everybody to the  strug 
gles  of  individual  interest,  are  always  the  first to  appeal to the interference 
of  Government  as  soon  as  the individual interests of the working-man come 
into conflict with their own class-interests. In such moments of collision they 
look with open admiration at the Continental States, where despotic govern 
ments, though, indeed,  not allowing the bourgeoisie to rule,  at least prevent 
the  working-men  from  resisting.  In  what  manner  the  revolutionary  party 
propose  to  make use of the present great conflict between masters and men, 
I  have  no  better  means  of  explaining  than  by  communicating  to  you  the 
foËowing  letter,  addressed  to  me  by  Ernest Jones,  the  Chartist leader,  on 
the  eve  of  his  departure  for  Lancashire,  where  the  campaign  is  to  be 
opened: 

20 

15 

"My  dear  Marx:  ...  To-morrow,  I  start  for  Blackstone-Edge,  where  a 
camp-meeting  of the  Chartists  of  Yorkshire and Lancashire is to take place, 
25  and  I  am  happy  to  inform  you that the most extensive preparations for the 
same  are  making  in  the  North.  It is  now  seven years  since a really national 
gathering  took  place  on  that  spot  sacred  to  the  traditions  of  the  Chartist 
movement,  and  the  object  of  the  present gathering  is  as  follows:  Through 
the  treacheries  and divisions of  1848, the disruption of the organization then 
30  existing,  by  the  incarceration  and  banishment  of  500  of  its  leading  m e n-
through  the  thinning  of  its  ranks  by  emigration—through  the  deadening  of 
political  energy  by  the  influences  of brisk trade—the  national  movement of 
Chartism  had  converted  itself  into  isolated  action,  and  the  organization 
dwindled  at the  very  time that  social knowledge  spread.  Meanwhile, a labor 
35 movement rose on the ruins of the political one—a labor movement emanating 
from  the  first  blind  gropings  of  social  knowledge.  This  labor  movement 
showed itself at first in isolated cooperative  attempts ; then, when these were 
found  to  fail,  in an energetic  action for  a ten-hour's  bill,  a restriction  of the 
moving  power,  an  abolition  of  the  stoppage  system  in wages,  and  a  fresh 
interpretation  of  the  Combination  Bill.  To  these  measures,  good  in them 
selves,  the  whole  power  and  attention of the working classes was  directed.

The failure  of  the attempts to obtain legislative guaranties for these measures 
has  thrown  a more  revolutionary  tendency in the labor-mind of  Britain. The 
opportunity  is  thus  afforded for rallying the  masses  around the  standard  of 
real  Social  Reform;  for  it  must  be  evident  to  all,  that  however  good  the 
measures  above  alluded  to  may  be,  to  meet  the  passing  exigencies  of the 
moment,  they  offer no  guaranties for the future, and embody no fundamental 
principle  of  social  right.  The  opportunity  thus  given  for  a  movement,  the 
power  for  successfully  carrying it out, is  also  afforded by the  circumstances 
of  the  present  time—the  discontent  of  the  people  being  accompanied by  an 
amount  of  popular  power  which  the  comparative  scarcity  of workingmen  10 
affords in relation to the briskness of trade. Strikes are prevalent everywhere 
and generally successful.  But it is lamentable  to behold that the power which 
might be  directed to  a fundamental remedy, should be wasted on a temporary 
palliative. I am, therefore, attempting, in reorganizing with numerous friends, 
to  seize  this  great  opportunity  for uniting  the  scattered  ranks  of  Chartism  15 
on the  sound principles of  social revolution. For this purpose I have succeed 
ed  in reorganizing the  dormant and extinct localities,  and arranging for what 
I  trust  will  be  a  general  and  imposing  demonstration  throughout  England. 
The  new  campaign  begins  by  the  camp-meeting  on Blackstone  Edge,  to  be 
followed  by  mass  meetings  in  all  the  manufacturing  Counties,  while  our  20 
agents  are at work in the  agricultural  districts,  so  as to unite the agricultural 
mind  with  the  rest  of  the  industrial  body,  a  point which  has  hitherto  been 
neglected in our  movement.  The  first  step  will be  a demand for the Charter, 
emanating  from  these  mass  meetings  of  the  people  and  an  attempt to  press 
a  motion  on  our  corrupt  Parliament  for  the  enactment  of  that  measure  25 
expressly and  explicitly as  the  only means  for  social  reform—a phase  under 
which  it  has  not  yet  been  presented  to  the  House.  If  the  working  classes 
support this movement, as  I anticipate, from their response to my appeal the 
result  must  be  important;  for  in  case  of  refusal  on  the  part  of  Parliament, 
the  hollow  professions  of  sham-liberals  and  philanthropic  Tories  will  be  30 
exposed,  and  their  last  hold  on  popular credulity  will be  destroyed.  In case 
of  their  consenting  to  entertain  and  discuss  the  motion,  a  torrent  will  be 
loosened which it will not be in the power of temporising expediency to stop. 
For  you must be  aware,  from your close  study of English politics, that there 
is  no  longer any pith or any strength in aristocracy or moneyocracy to resist  35 
any  serious movement of the  people.  The  governing powers  consist only of 
a confused jumble  of  worn-out factions,  that have  run together  like a ship's 
crew  that  have  quarreled  among  themselves,  join  all  hands  at  the  pump  to 
save  the leaky vessel. There is no  strength in them and the throwing of a few 
drops  of  bilge  water  into  the  democratic ocean will be utterly powerless to  40 
allay  the  raging  of  its  waves.  Such,  my  friend,  is  the  opportunity  I  now 

176 

English  Prosperity—Strikes—The  Turkish  Question—India 

behold—such  is  the  power  wherewith  I  hope  to  see  it  used,  and  such is the 
first  immediate  object  to  which  that  power  shall  be  directed.  On the  result 
of  the  first  demonstration  I  shall  again write  to  you. 

Yours  truly,  Ernest  Jones." 

5  That  there  is  no  prospect  at  all  of  the  intended  Chartist  petition  being  taken 
into  consideration  by  Parliament,  needs  not  to  be  proved  by  argument. 
Whatever  illusions  may have  been entertained  on this  point,  they must now 
vanish  before  the  fact,  that  Parliament  has  just  rejected,  by  a  majority  of 
60  votes,  the  proposition  for  the  ballot  introduced  by  Mr. Berkeley,  and 
10  advocated by Messrs. Phillimore, Cobden, Bright, Sir Robert Peel, etc. And 
this  is  done  by  the  very  Parliament  which went  to  the utmost in protesting 
against  the  intimidation  and  bribery  employed  at its  own  election,  and  neg 
lected  for  months  all  serious  business,  for  the  whim  of  decimating itself  in 
election inquiries. The only remedy, purity Johnny has yet found out against 
15  bribery,  intimidation  and  corrupt practices,  has  been the  disfranchisement 
or  rather  the  narrowing  of  constituencies.  And  there is  no  doubt that, if he 
had  succeeded in making the constituencies of the same small size as himself, 
the Oligarchy would be able to get their votes without the trouble and expense 
of  buying  them.  Mr. Berkeley's  resolution  was  rejected  by  the  combined 
20  Tories and Whigs, their common interest being at stake: the preservation of 
their  territorial  influence  over  the  tenants  at will, the petty shopkeepers and 
other  retainers  of  the  land-owner.  "Who  has  to  pay his  rent, has to  pay his 
vote,"  is  an  old  adage  of  the  glorious  British  Constitution. 

Last  Saturday  The  Press,  a  new  weekly  paper  under  the  influence  of 
25  Mr. Disraeli,  made  a  curious  disclosure  to  the  public  of  England,  as  fol 

lows: 

"Early  in  the  spring  Baron  Brunnow  communicated  to  Lord  Clarendon 
the  demand  which  the  Emperor  of Russia was  about to  make  on the Porte, 
that  he  did  so  with  a  statement  that  the  object  of  the  communication was 
30 to ascertain the feeling of England on the subject—that Lord Clarendon made 
no  objection,  nor  in any way discouraged  the intended  course,  and that the 
Muscovite  diplomatist  communicated  to  his  imperial  master  that  England 
was  not  indisposed  to  connive  at  his  designs  on  the  Golden  Horn." 

35 

Now,  The  Times of yesterday had  an elaborate  and official article emanat-
ing from the  Foreign  Office,  in  answer  to  the grave charge of Mr. Disraeli, 
but  which,  in  my  opinion,  tends  rather  to  strengthen  than  to  refute  that 
charge.  The Times asserts that, early in the spring, before the arrival of Prince 
Menchikoff  at  Constantinople,  Baron  Brunnow  made  a  complaint  to  Lord 
John  Russell,  that  the  Porte  had  revoked  the  privileges  conferred  on  the 
40  Greek  clergy  by  treaty,  and  that  Lord  John  Russell,  conceiving the  matter 
only to concern the  Holy Places, gave his  assent to the  designs of the Czar. 

177 

Karl Marx 

But  The  Times  is  compelled  at  the  same  time  to  concede  that  after  Prince 
Menchikoff's  arrival  at  Constantinople,  and  when  Lord  John  Russell  had 
been  replaced  by  Lord  Clarendon  at  the  Foreign  Office,  Baron  Brunnow 
made  a further  communication to  Lord  Clarendon  "purporting to convey the 
sense  of  his  instructions,  and  some  of  the  expressions  used in the  letter of 
credentials  of  which  Prince  Menchikoff  was  the  bearer  from  the  Emperor 
of  Russia  to  the  Sultan."  Simultaneously,  The  Times  admits  that  "Lord 
Clarendon  gave  his  assent  to  the  demands  communicated  by  Baron  Brun 
now." Evidently this  second communication must have contained something 
more  than what had been communicated to  Lord John Russell.  The  matter,  10 
therefore, cannot stop with this declaration. Either Baron Brunnow must turn 
out  a diplomatical cheat  or  my  Lords  Clarendon  and  Aberdeen  are  traitors. 
We  shall  see.

It may be of interest to your readers to become acquainted with a document 
concerning the  Eastern question,  which was recently published in a London  15 
newspaper.  It  is  a  proclamation  issued  by  the  Prince  of  Armenia,  now  re 
siding  in  London,  and  distributed  among  the  Armenians  in Turkey: 

"Leo,  by  the  grace  of  God,  sovereign  Prince  of  Armenia,  etc.,  to  the 

Armenians  in  Turkey: 

Beloved brothers  and faithful countrymen.—Our will and our  ardent wish  20 

is  that  you  should  defend  to  the  last  drop  of  your  blood  your  country  and 
the  Sultan  against  the  tyrant  of the North.  Remember, my brothers, that in 
Turkey there  are  no  knouts,  they  do  not tear your  nostrils  and your  women 
are  not  flogged,  secretly  or  in  public.  Under  the  reign  of  the  Sultan,  there 
is  humanity,  while  under that of  the tyrant  of  the  North there  are  nothing  25 
but  atrocities.  Therefore  place  yourselves  under  the  direction  of  God,  and 
fight bravely for the  liberty of your country and  your present  sovereign.  Pull 
down your houses  to  make barricades,  and if  you have  no arms, break your 
furniture  and defend yourselves with it.  May Heaven guide you on your path 
to  glory.  My only  happiness  will  be  to  fight  in the midst of you against the  30 
oppressor  of  your  country,  and  your  creed.  May  God  incline  the  Sultan's 
heart to  sanction  my  demand,  because  under  his  reign,  our religion remains 
in  its  pure  form,  while,  under  the  Northern  tyrant,  it  will  be  altered.  Re 
member,  at least, brothers,  that the blood that runs  in the veins  of him who 
now  addresses  you,  is  the  blood of twenty kings, it is the blood of heroes—  35 
Lusignans—and  defenders  of  our faith;  and we  say to  you, let us  defend our 
creed  and  its  pure  form,  until  our  last  drop  of  blood." 

On the  13th inst.  Lord  Stanley gave notice to the House of Commons that 
on  the  second  reading  of  the  India  Bill  (23d  inst.)  he  would  bring  in  the 
following resolution: 

40 

"That  in  the  opinion  of  this  House  further  information  is  necessary  to 

178 

English  Prosperity—Strikes—The  Turkish  Question—India 

enable Parliament to legislate with advantage for the permanent government 
of India, and that at this late period of the session, it is inexpedient to proceed 
into  a  measure,  which,  while  it  disturbs  existing  arrangements,  cannot  be 
regarded  as  a  final  settlement." 

2o 

5 

But in April,  1854, the Charter of the East India Company will expire, and 
something  accordingly  must  be  done  in one way  or the  other.  The  Govern 
ment wanted to legislate permanently ; that is, to renew the Charter for twenty 
years  more.  The  Manchester  School  wanted  to  postpone  all  legislation, by 
prolonging the Charter at the utmost for one  year. The Government said that 
10  permanent legislation was necessary forthe "best" of India. The Manchester 
men  replied  that  it  was  impossible  for  want  of  information.  The  "best"  of 
India,  and the  want of information,  are  alike  false pretences. The governing 
oligarchy  desired,  before  a  Reformed  House  should  meet,  to  secure  at the 
cost  of  India,  their  own  "best"  for  twenty  years  to  come.  The  Manchester 
15  men  desired  no  legislation  at  all  in  the unreformed Parliament, where then-
views  had  no  chance  of  success.  Now,  the  Coalition  Cabinet,  through  Sir 
Charles  Wood,  has,  in  contradiction  to  its  former  statements,  but  in  con 
formity with its habitual  system of  shifting difficulties, brought in something 
that  looked  like  legislation;  but  it  dared  not,  on  the  other hand, to  propose 
the  renewal  of  the  Charter  for  any  definite period, but presented a "settle 
ment,"  which  it  left  to  Parliament  to  unsettle  whenever  that  body  should 
determine  to  do  so.  If  the  Ministerial  propositions  were  adopted,  the  East 
India  Company  would  obtain  no  renewal  but  only  a  suspension  of  life.  In 
all  other  respects,  the  Ministerial  project  but  apparently  alters  the  Con-
stitution of the  India Government, the only serious novelty to be introduced 
being  the  addition  of  some  new Governors,  although a long experience  has 
proved  that the  parts  of  East India  administered  by  simple  Commissioners, 
go  on  much  better  than  those  blessed  with  the  costly  luxury  of Governors 
and  Councils.  The  Whig  invention  of  alleviating  exhausted  countries  by 
30  burdening them with new  sinecures  for the paupers of Aristocracy, reminds 
one  of the  old  Russell  administration when  the  Whigs were  suddenly  struck 
with  the  state  of  spiritual  destitution,  in  which  the  Indians  and  Mahom-
medans  of  the  East were  living,  and  determined  upon relieving them  by  the 
importation of  some  new Bishops, the  Tories, in the plenitude of their power, 
35  having never thought more than one to be necessary. That resolution having 
been agreed upon, Sir John Hobhouse, the then Whig President of the Board 
of  Control,  discovered  immediately  afterwards,  that  he  had  a  relative  ad 
mirably  suited  for  a  Bishopric,  who  was  forthwith  appointed  to  one  of the 
new  sees.  "In cases  of  this  kind,"  remarks  an English writer,  "where the fit 
is  so  exact,  it is  really  hardly  possible  to  say,  whether  the  shoe  was  made 
for the foot, or the foot for the shoe." Thus with regard to the Charles Wood's 

40 

25 

179 

Karl Marx 

invention;  it  would be  very  difficult to  say,  whether  the  new  Governors are 
made  for  Indian  provinces,  or  Indian  provinces  for  the  new  Governors. 

Be this  as  it may,  the  Coalition Cabinet believed it had met all clamors by 
leaving  to  Parliament  the  power  of  altering  its  proposed  act  at  all  times. 
Unfortunately  in  steps  Lord  Stanley,  the  Tory,  with  his  resolution  which  was  5 
loudly  cheered  by the  "Radical"  Opposition,  when it  was  announced.  Lord 
Stanley's  resolution  is,  nevertheless  self-contradictory.  On  one  hand,  he 
rejects  the  Ministerial  proposition,  because  the  House  requires  more  in 
formation for permanent legislation.  On the other hand, he rejects it, because 
it  is  no  permanent  legislation,  but  alters  existing  arrangements,  without  10 
pretending  to  finality.  The  Conservative  view  is,  of course,  opposed  to  the 
bill, because it involves a change of some kind. The Radical view is opposed 
to  it, because it involves  no  real change at all. Lord Stanley, in these coales-
cent  times  has  found  a  formula  in  which  the  opposite  views  are  combined 
together  against the Ministerial view of the  subject. The Coalition Ministry  15 
affects  a  virtuous  indignation  against  such  tactics,  and  The  Chronicle,  its 
organ,  exclaims: 

"Viewed as a party-move the proposed motion for delay is in a high degree 
This  motion is brought forward solely because 

factious and discreditable 
some  supporters  of  the  Ministry  are  pledged  to  separate  in this  particular  20 
question  from  those  with  whom  they  usually  act." 

The  anxiety  of  Ministers  seems  indeed  to  be  serious.  The  Chronicle of 

to-day,  again  recurring  to  the  subject,  says: 

"The  division  on  Lord  Stanley's  motion  will  probably  be  decisive of the 

fate  of  the  India Bill; it is therefore of the  utmost importance that those who 
feel  the 
strengthen  the  Government." 

importance  of  early  legislation,  should  use  every  exertion  to 

25 

On  the  other  hand,  we  read  in  The  Times of  to-day: 
"The  fate  of  the  Government  India  Bill  has  been  more  respectively  de 
lineated  . ..  The  danger  of  the  Government  lies  in the  entire conforming of  30 
Lord  Stanley's  objections  with  the  conclusions  of  public  opinion.  Every 
syllable  of  this  amendment tells  with deadly  effect against the  ministry." 

I  shall  expose  in  a  subsequent  letter,  the  bearing  of  the  Indian  Question 
on the  different parties in Great Britain, and the benefit the poor Hindoo may 
reap from this quarreling of the aristocracy, the moneyocracy and the milloc-  35 
racy  about  his  amelioration.

Correspondence  of  The  N.Y.Tribune. 

London, Tuesday, June  21,  1853. 

In  the  year  1828,  when  Russia was  permitted  to  overrun  Turkey  with war, 
and  to  terminate  that  war  by  the  Treaty  of  Adrianople,  which  surrendered 
to  her  the  whole  of  the  Eastern  coast  of  the  Black  Sea, from Anapa in the 
North to  Poti in the  South,  (except Circassia) and delivered into her posses 
sion  the  islands  at  the  mouth  of  the  Danube,  virtually  separated  Moldavia 
and  Wallachia from Turkey,  and placed them under  Russian  supremacy—at 
that  epoch  Lord  Aberdeen  happened  to  be  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  in 
Great  Britain.  In  1853  we  find the  very  same  Aberdeen  as  the  chief  of the 
"composite  ministry"  in  the  same  country.  This  simple  fact  goes  far  to 
explain  the  overbearing  attitude  assumed  by  Russia  in  her  present conflict 
with  Turkey  and  with  Europe. 

I  told  you  in  my  last  letter  that  the  storm  aroused  by  the  revelations  of 
The  Press respecting  the  secret  transactions  between  Aberdeen,  Clarendon 
and  Baron  Brunnow,  was  not  likely to  subside  under  the  hair-splitting, tor 
tuous  and  disingenuous  pleading of Thursday's  Times.  The  Times: was even 
then forced to admit in a semi-official article, that Lord Clarendon had indeed 
given  his  assent  to  the  demands  about  to  be  made  by  Russia  on  the Porte, 
but  said  that  the  demands  as  represented  in  London,  and  those  actually 
proposed  at  Constantinople,  had  turned  out to  be  of  quite  a  different  tenor, 
although the papers communicated by Baron Brunnow to the British Minister 

181 

Karl Marx 

purported  to  be  "literal  extracts" from  the  instructions  forwarded to  Prince 
Menchikoff.  On  the  following  Saturday,  however,  The  Times  retracted  its 
assertions—undoubtedly  in  consequence  of  remonstrances made on the part 
of  the  Russian Embassy—and  gave  Baron Brunnow  a  testimonial  of perfect 
"candor  and  faith."  The  Morning  Herald  of  yesterday  puts  the  question 
"whether Russia had not perhaps given false  instructions  to Baron Brunnow 
himself,  in  order  to  deceive  the  British  Minister?"  In  the  meantime,  fresh 
disclosures,  studiously  concealed  from  the  public  by  a corrupt  daily  press, 
have  been  made, which exclude any  such interpretation, throwing the whole 
blame on the  shoulders  of the  "composite  ministry,"  and quite  sufficient to 
warrant  the  impeachment  of  Lords  Aberdeen  and  Clarendon  before  any 
other  Parliament  than the  present,  which  is  but  a paralytic produce  of  dead 
constituencies  artificially  stimulated  into  life  by  unexampled  bribery  and 
intimidation.

It  is  stated  that  a  communication was  made  to  Lord Clarendon, wherein  15 

he  was  informed  that  the  affair  of  the  Shrines  was  noi the  sole object oí the 
Russian Prince. In that communication the general question was entered into, 
the  question  of  the  Greek  Christians  of  Turkey,  and  of  the  position  of  the 
Emperor  of  Russia  with  respect  to  them  under  certain  treaties.  All  these 
points  were  canvassed,  and  the  course  about to be  adopted by  Russia ex-  20 
plicitly  stated—the  same  as  detailed  in  the  projected  convention  of  the  6th 
of May.  Lord Clarendon, with the assent of Lord Aberdeen, in no wise either 
disapproved or discouraged that course. While matters stood thus in London, 
Bonaparte  sent  his  fleet  to  Salamis,  public  opinion  pressed  from  without, 
Ministers were  interpellated  in both Houses, Russell pledged  himself to  the  25 
maintenance  of  the  integrity  and  independence  of  Turkey,  and  Prince 
Menchikoff  threw off the mask at Constantinople.  It now became  necessary 
for  Lords  Aberdeen  and  Clarendon  to  initiate  the  other  Ministers  in  what 
had been done, and the  Coalition was on the eve of being broken up, as Lord 
Palmerston,  forced  by  his  antecedents,  urged  a  directly  opposite  line  of  30 
policy.  In  order  to  prevent  the  dissolution  of  his  Cabinet,  Lord  Aberdeen 
finally  yielded  to  Lord  Palmerston,  and  consented  to  the  combined  action 
of  the  English  and  French  fleets  in  the  Dardanelles.  But  at  the  same  time, 
in order to  fulfill his  engagements  toward Russia,  Lord Aberdeen intimated 
through a private  dispatch to  St. Petersburg that he would not look upon the  35 
occupation  of  the  Danubian  Principalities  by  the  Russians  as  a casus belli, 
and  The  Times received  orders  to  prepare  public  opinion for this new inter 
pretation of international treaties.  It would be unjust to withhold the testimo 
nial  that  it  has  labored hard enough to  prove that black is white.  This  same 
journal,  which  had  all  along  contended  that  the  Russian  protectorate  over  40 
the  Greek  Christians  of  Turkey  would  not  be  of  any political  consequence 

182 

Turkey  and  Russia—Connivance  of  the  Aberdeen  Ministry  with  Russia—The  Budget 

at  all  asserted  at  once  that  Moldavia  and  Wallachia  were  placed  under  a 
divided  allegiance,  and formed  in reality no  integral  portions  of  the Turkish 
Empire ; that their occupation would not be an invasion of the Turkish Empire 
in the  "strict  sense of the word,"  inasmuch as the treaties  of Bucharest and 
5  Adrianople  had given  to  the  Czar  a  Protectorate  over  his  co-religionists  in 
the  Danubian  Provinces.  The  Convention  of  Balta  Liman,  concluded  on 
May  1,1849,  distinctly  stipulates: 

" 1.  That the  occupation  of  those  provinces,  if  it occurs,  shall only be by 

a joint  one  of  Russian  and  Turkish  forces. 

10 

2.  That  the  sole  plea  for  it  shall  be  in  grave  events  taking  place  in  the 

principalities." 

Now  as  no  events  at  all  have  taken  place  in  those  principalities,  and 
moreover,  as  Russia  has  no  intention  to  enter  them  in  common  with  the 
Turks,  but  precisely  against  Turkey,  The  Times  is  of  opinion,  that  Turkey 
15  ought to  suffer quietly the  occupation by Russia alone,  and afterward enter 
into  negotiations  with  her.  But  if  Turkey  should be of  a less  sedate  temper 
and  consider  the  occupation  as  a casus belli,  The  Times argues that England 
and  France  must not do  so ; and if, nevertheless, England and France should 
do  so,  The  Times recommends  that it  should be  done  in a gentle  manner by 
20  no  means  as  belligerents  against  Russia,  but  only  as  defensive  allies  of 

Turkey. 

This  cowardly and tortuous  system of  The  Times, I cannot more appropri 
ately  stigmatise than by quoting the following passage from its leading article 
of  to-day.  It  is  an  incredible  combination  of  all  the  contradictions,  sub-
terfuges,  false  pretences,  anxieties  and  lâchetés  of  Lord  Aberdeen's 
policy: 

25 

"Before  proceeding  to  the  last  extremities  the  Porte  may,  if  it think fit, 
protest  against  the  occupation  of  the  principalities,  and  with  the  support 
of  all  the  Powers  of  Europe,  may  still  negotiate.  It  will  remain  with  the 
30  Turkish  government,  acting  in  concert  with  the  ambassadors  of  the  four 
Powers, to determine this momentous point, and especially to decide whether 
the  state  of  hostilities  is  such  as  to  cause  the  Dardanelles  to  be  opened  to 
foreign  ships  of war, under  the  Convention of  1841.  Should that question be 
decided  in the  affirmative,  and  the  fleets  be  ordered  to  enter the  Straits,  it 
35  will  then remain to be  seen whether we  come there as mediating Powers or 
as  belligerents;  for  supposing  Turkey  and  Russia to  be  at  war,  and foreign 
vessels  of  war  to  be  admitted,  casus  foederis  (!)  they  do  not  necessarily 
acquire  a belligerent character,  and they have  a far greater interest in main 
taining that of mediating Powers, inasmuch as they are  sent not to make war 
40  but to  prevent it.  Such  a  measure  does not of necessity  make us principals 

in  the  contest."

All  the  leaders  of  The  Times  have  been  to  no  purpose.  No  other  paper 
would follow in its track—none would bite at its bait, and even the Ministerial 
papers,  The  Morning  Chronicle,  Morning Post,  Globe,  and  Observertake  an 
entirely  different  stand,  finding a loud echo on the other side of the channel, 
where only the legitimist Assemblée JVaü'ona/epresumes to see no  casus belli 
in  the  occupation  of  the  Danubian  Principalities.

The  dissension  in  the  camp  of  the  Coalition  Ministry  has  thus  been  be 
trayed to  the  public  by the clamorous dissension in their organs. Palmerston 
urged  upon  the  Cabinet  to  hold  the  occupation  of  Moldavia  and  Wallachia 
as a declaration of war, and he was backed up by the Whig and Sham-Radical 
members  of  the composite Ministry.  Lord Aberdeen, having only consented 
to  the common action of the French and English fleets upon the understand 
ing  that  Russia  would  not  act  at  the  Dardanelles  but  in  the  Danubian 
Provinces,  was  now  quite  "outwinded."  The  existence  of  the  Government 
was  again  at  stake.  At  least,  at  the  pressing  instances  of  Lord  Aberdeen,  15 
Palmerston was  prepared to give a sullen assent to the unchallenged occupa 
tion  of  the  Principalities  by Russia, when  suddenly  a dispatch  arrived from 
Paris  announcing that Bonaparte had resolved to view the same act as a casus 
belli.  The  confusion  has  now  reached  its  highest  point. 

10 

Now,  if  this  statement  be  correct,  and  from  our  knowledge  of  Lord  20 

Aberdeen's  past,  there  is  every  reason  to  consider  it  as  such—the  whole 
mystery  of  that  Russo-Turkish  tragi-comedy  that  has  occupied  Europe  for 
months  together,  is  laid bare.  We  understand  at once,  why  Lord Aberdeen 
would not move the British fleet from Malta. We understand the rebuke given 
to  Colonel  Rose  for  his  resolute  conduct  at  Constantinople,  the  bullying  25 
behavior  of  Prince  Menchikoff,  and  the  heroic  firmness  of  the  Czar  who, 
conceiving  the  warlike  movements  of  England  as  a mere farce,  would have 
been glad  to  be  allowed,  by the uncontroverted occupation of Moldavia and 
Wallachia,  not only to  withdraw from the  stage  as  the "master," but to hold 
his  annual  grand  maneuvers  at the  cost  and  expense  of  the  subjects of the  30 
Sultan.  We  believe  that,  if  war  should  break out,  it  will  be  because Russia 
had gone  too  far to  withdraw  with impunity to  her  honor;  and  above all, we 
believe her courage to be up to this notch simply because she has all the while 
counted  on  England's  connivance. 

On this head the following passage is in point from the last letter from  The 

35 

Englishman  on  the  Coalition-Ministry: 

"The  coalition is  shaking at every breeze that flows from the Dardanelles. 
The  fears  of the  good  Aberdeen  and the  miserable incompetence of Claren 
don,  encouraged  Russia,  and  have  produced  the  crisis." 

The  latest  news  from  Turkey  is  as  follows:  The  Turkish Ambassador  at  40 

Paris  has received by telegraph, via Sernlin,  a dispatch from Constantinople, 

184 

Turkey  and  Russia—Connivance  of  the  Aberdeen  Ministry  with  Russia—The  Budget 

informing him that the  Porte has rejected the last ultimatum of Russia, taking 
its  stand  on  the  memorandum  forwarded  to  the  Great  Powers.  The  Sema 
phore,  of  Marseilles,  states  that  news  had  been  received  at  Smyrna  of  the 
capture  of  two  Turkish  trading  vessels  on  the  Black  Sea by  the  Russians; 
5  but  that,  on  the  other  hand,  the  Caucasian  tribes  had  opened  a  general 
campaign  against the Russians, in which Shamyl had achieved a most brilliant 
victory,  taking no  less  than 23  cannons.

Mr. Gladstone  has  now  announced  his  altered  proposals,  with  regard  to 
the  Advertisement  Duty.  He  had  proposed,  in  order  to  secure  the  support 
of  The  Times, to  strike  the  duty off  supplements œntaining advertisements 
only.  He now proposes, intimidated by public opinion, to let all single supple 
ments  go  free,  and  to  tax  each  double  supplement  ll2d.  Imagine  the  fury of 
The  Times, which, by this  altered proposition, will only gain £20,000, instead 
of £40,000  a year,  besides  seeing the market thrown open to its competitors. 
15  This  consistent  journal  which defends to the utmost the taxes upon knowl 
edge, and the  duty on advertisements, now opposes any tax on supplements. 
But it may console itself.  If the  Ministry,  after  having carried the greater part 
of  the  budget,  feel  no  longer  any  necessity  for  cajoling  The  Times,  the 
Manchester men, as  soon as they have  secured their share of the budget, will 
20  no longer want the Ministry. This is what the latter apprehend, and that very 
apprehension  accounts  for the  fact  of the  budget  discussion extending over 
the  whole  period  of  the  session.  It  is  characteristic  of  the  compensating 
justice of  Mr. Gladstone, that while he reduces the newspaper advertisement 
duty  from  Is.  6d.  to  Is.  3d.,  he  proposes  to  tax  the literary advertisements 
inserted  at  the  end  of  most books  and reviews,  6  pence  each.

To-night the House of Commons will be occupied on two  cases of bribery. 
During  the  present  session  47  Election-Committees  have  been  sitting,  out 
of which, 4 are yet sitting, 43 having concluded their investigations, by finding 
the  majority of the unseated members guilty of bribery.  To  show the respect 
in  which  this  Parliament,  the  offspring  of  corruption  and  the  parent  of 
Coalitions,  is  held  by  public  opinion,  it  is  sufficient  to  quote  the  following 
words  of  to-day's  Morning  Herald: 

30 

"If want of clear aim and object, and still more, the tottering and quavering 
attack,  be  symptomatic  of  imbecility,  then  it  must  be  confessed  that  this 
35  Parliament, the child of  six months, has fallen already into  second childish 
ness.  It is  already  subsiding and curdling  away into  small knots of spiritless 
and  purposeless  coteries."

The  East India Company-
Its History and Results. 

Correspondence  of  The  N.Y.Tribune. 

London,  Friday, June  24,  1853. 

The debate  on  Lord  Stanley's  motion to postpone  legislation for India,  has 
been  deferred  until  this  evening.  For  the  first  time  since  1783  the  India 
Question  has  become  a  Ministerial  one  in  England.  Why  is  this? 

5 

The true commencement of the  East India Company  cannot be dated from 
a more remote epoch than the year  1702, when the different societies, claim 
ing  the  monopoly  of  the  East  India  trade,  united  together,in  one  single  10 
Company.  Till  then  the  very  existence  of  the  original  East India Company 
was repeatedly endangered, once suspended for years under the protectorate 
of  Cromwell,  and  once  threatened  with utter  dissolution  by  parliamentary 
interference  under  the reign of William  III.  It was  under the  ascendancy of 
that  Dutch  Prince  when  the  Whigs  became  the  farmers  of  the  revenues  of  15 
the  British  Empire,  when  the  Bank  of  England  sprung  into  life,  when  the 
protective  system  was  firmly  established  in  England,  and  the  balance  of 
power  in Europe  was  definitively  settled, that the existence of an East India 
Company  was  recognized  by  Parliament.  That  era  of  apparent  liberty  was 
in reality the era of monopolies not created by Royal grants,  as in the  times  20 
of  Elizabeth  and  Charles  I.,  but  authorized  and nationalized by the  sanction 
of  Parliament.  This  epoch  in  the  history  of  England  bears,  in  fact,  an 
extreme  likeness  to  the  epoch  of  Louis  Philippe  in  France,  the  old  landed 
aristocracy having been  defeated,  and the bourgeoisie not being able to take 
its  place  except  under  the  banner  of  moneyocracy,  or the  "haute finance. "  25 
The  East India  Company  excluded  the  common people  from  the commerce 

186 

The  East  India  Company—Its  History  and  Results 

with India, at the  same time that the House of Commons excluded them from 
parliamentary  representation.  In this  as  well  as  in  other  instances,  we find 
the  first  decisive  victory  of  the  bourgeoisie  over  the  feudal  aristocracy 
coinciding with the most pronounced reaction against the people, a phenome-
5  non  which  has  driven  more  than  one  popular  writer,  like  Cobbett,  to  look 

for  popular  liberty  rather  in  the  past  than  in  the  future. 

10 

The  union  between  the  Constitutional  Monarchy  and  the  monopolizing 
monied  interest,  between  the  Company  of  East  India  and  the  "glorious" 
revolution  of  1688  was  fostered  by  the  same  force  by  which  the  liberal 
interests and a liberal dynasty have at all times  and in all countries  met and 
combined,  by  the  force  of  corruption,  that  first  and  last  moving  power  of 
Constitutional  Monarchy,  the  guardian  angel  of  William  III.  and  the  fatal 
demon  of  Louis  Philippe.  So  early as  1693,  it appeared from parliamentary 
inquiries,  that the  annual  expenditure  of the East India Company, under the 
15  head of "gifts" to men in power, which had rarely amounted to above £1,200 
before  the  revolution,  reached the  sum of £90,000.  The  Duke  of Leeds  was 
impeached  for  a  bribe  of  £5,000,  and  the  virtuous  King  himself  convicted 
of  having  received  £10,000.  Besides these  direct briberies,  rival  Companies 
were  thrown  out  by  tempting Government with loans  of  enormous  sums  at 
the lowest interest,  and by  buying  off  rival  Directors. 

20 

The  power  the  East India Company  had  obtained  by  bribing the  Govern 
ment,  as  did also the  Bank of  England,  it was forced to  maintain by  bribing 
again,  as  did  the  Bank  of  England.  At every epoch when its  monopoly was 
expiring,  it could  only  effect  a renewal  of  its  charter by offering fresh loans 

25  and  by  fresh presents  made  to  the  Government. 

The  events  of  the  seven-years-war  transformed  the  East  India Company 
from  a commercial  into  a  military  and territorial  power.  It was then that the 
foundation was laid of the present British Empire in the East. Then East India 
stock rose  to  £263,  and  dividends were then paid at the rate of  I2V2 per cent. 
30  But then there appeared a new enemy to the Company, no longer in the shape 
of  rival  societies,  but  in  the  shape  of  rival  ministers  and  of  a  rival  people. 
It  was  alleged  that  the  Company's  territory  had been conquered by the  aid 
of  British  fleets  and  British  armies,  and  that no  British  subjects  could hold 
territorial  sovereignties  independent  of the  Crown. The ministers of the day 
35  and  the  people  of  the  day claimed their  share in the  "wonderful treasures" 
imagined to  have  been won by the  last conquests.  The Company only saved 
its  existence  by  an  agreement  made  in  1767  that  it  should  annually  pay 
£400,000  into  the  National  Exchequer. 

40 

But  the  East  India  Company,  instead  of  fulfilling  its  agreement,  got into 
financial  difficulties,  and,  instead of paying  a tribute to the  English people, 
appealed  to  Parliament for pecuniary  aid.  Serious  alterations  in the  Charter 

187 

Karl Marx 

were the consequence of this  step.  The Company's affairs failing to improve, 
notwithstanding their  new  condition,  and  the English nation having simulta 
neously  lost  their  colonies  in  North-America,  the  necessity  of  elsewhere 
regaining  some  great  Colonial  Empire  became  more  and  more  universally 
felt.  The  illustrious Fox thought the opportune moment had arrived, in  1783, 
for  bringing  forward  his  famous  India  bill,  which  proposed  to  abolish  the 
Courts of Directors and Proprietors, and to vest the whole Indian government 
in  the  hands  of  seven  Commissioners  appointed  by  Parliament.  By  the 
personal  influence  of  the  imbecile  King  over  the  House  of  Lords,  the  bill 
of Mr. Fox was defeated, and made the instrument of breaking down the then 
Coalition  Government  of  Fox  and  Lord  North,  and  of  placing  the  famous 
Pitt  at  the  head  of  the  Government.  Pitt  carried  in  1784 a bill through both 
Houses,  which directed the establishment of the Board of Control, consisting 
of  six members  of  the  Privy Council, who  were  "to  check,  superintend  and 
control  all  acts,  operations  and  concerns  which  in  any  wise  related  to 
the  civil  and  military  government,  or  revenues  of  the  territories  and  pos 
sessions  of  the  East  India  Company."  On  this  head,  Mill,  the  historian, 
says: 

"In  passing  that  law  two  objects  were  pursued.  To  avoid the  imputation 
of  what  was  represented  as  the  heinous  object  of  Mr. Fox's  bill,  it  was 
necessary  that  the  principal  part  of  the  power  should  appear to  remain  in 
the  hands  of  the  Directors.  For  ministerial  advantage it was  necessary that 
it  should  in  reality be  all  taken  away.  Mr. Pitt's  bill  professed  to  differ  from 
that  of  his  rival,  chiefly  in this  very point,  that while  the  one  destroyed the 
power  of  the  Directors,  the  other  left  it  almost  entire;  Under  the  act  of 
Mr. Fox the  powers of the ministers would have been avowedly held.  Under 
the  act  of  Mr. Pitt  they  were  held  in  secret  and  by  fraud.  The  bill  of  Fox 
transferred  the  power  of  the  Company  to  Commissioners  appointed  by 
Parliament.  The bill of Mr. Pitt transferred them to Commissioners appointed 
by  the  King." 

The  years  of  1783 and  1784 were thus the first, and till now the only years, 
for the India question to become a ministerial one. The bill of Mr. Pitt having 
been  carried,  the  charter  of  the  East India  Company was  renewed,  and  the 
Indian question set aside for twenty years.  But in  1813 the Anti-Jacobin war, 
and  in  1833  the  newly introduced Reform  Bui  superseded  all other  political, 
questions. 

This,  then,  is  the  first  reason  of  the  India  question's  having  failed  to 
become a great political question, since and before 1784; that before that time 
the  East  India Company had first to  conquer existence and importance; that 
after  that time the  Oligarchy absorbed all of its power which it could assume 
without  incurring  responsibility;  and  that  afterwards  the  English  people  in 

188 

The  East  India  Company—Its  History  and  Results 

general  were  at  the  very  epochs  of  the  renewal  of  the  charter,  in  1813  and 
at  1833,  absorbed  by  other  questions  of  overbearing  interest. 

We  will  now  take  a different  view.  The  East  India Company  commenced 
by  attempting  merely  to  establish  factories  for  their  agents,  and  places  of 
5  deposit  for  their goods.  In order  to  protect them  they erected  several forts. 
Although  they  had,  even  as  early  as  1689,  conceived  the  establishment  of 
a  dominion  in  India,  and  of  making  territorial  revenue  one  of  their  sources 
of  emolument,  yet,  down to  1744,  they  had  acquired but  a few unimportant 
districts  around Bombay, Madras, and Calcutta. The war which subsequently 
io  broke  out  in  the  Carnatic  had  the  effect  of  rendering  them  after  various 
struggles,  virtual  sovereigns  of  that  part  of  India.  Much more  considerable 
results arose from the  war in Bengal and the victories of Clive. These results 
were  the  real  occupation  of  Bengal,  Bihar,  and  Orissa.  At  the  end  of  the 
Eighteenth  Century,  and  in  the  first  years  of  the  present  one,  there  super-
15 vened the wars with Tippo-Saib, and in consequence of them a great advance 
of  power, and an immense extension of the  subsidiary  system.  In the  second 
decennium  of  the  Nineteenth  Century  the  first  convenient frontier,  that of 
India  within  the  desert,  had  at  length  been  conquered.  It  was  not  till  then 
that  the  British  Empire  in  the  East  reached  those  parts  of Asia, which had 
20 been, at all times, the seat of every great central power in India. But the most 
vulnerable  point of  the  Empire, from  which it had  been  overrun  as  often  as 
old  conquerors  were  expelled  by  new  ones,  the  barriers  of  the  Western 
frontier,  were  not  in  the  hands  of  the  British.  During  the period from  1838 
to  1849,  in  the  Sikh  and  Afghan  wars,  British  rule  subjected  to  definitive 
25  possession  the  ethnographical,  political,  and  military  frontiers  of  the  East 
Indian  Continent,  by  the  compulsory  annexation  of  the  Punjaub  and  of 
Scinde.  These  were  possessions  indispensable to repulse any invading force 
issuing from Central Asia, and indispensable  against Russia advancing to the 
frontiers  of  Persia.  During this  last  decennium  there have been added to the 
30  British Indian territory  167,000  square miles, with a population of 8,572,630 
souls.  As  to  the  interior,  all  the  native  States  now  became  surrounded  by 
British  possessions,  subjected  to  British  suzeraineté  under  various  forms, 
and  cut off from the sea-coast, with the sole exception of Guzerat and Scinde. 
As to its  exterior,  India was  now finished.  It is  only  since  1849, that the one 

35  great Anglo-Indian Empire  has  existed. 

Thus  the  British  Government  has  been  fighting,  under  the  Company's 
name,  for two centuries, till at last the natural limits  of India were reached. 
We  understand  now,  why  during  all  this  time  all  parties  in  England  have 
connived  in  silence,  even  those  which  had  resolved  to  become  the  loudest 
40  with their  hypocritical  peace-cant,  after the  arrondissementoi the one Indian 
Empire  should  have  been  completed.  Firstly,  of  course,  they  had  to  get  it 

189 

Karl  Marx 

in  order  to  subject it  afterward  to their sharp philanthrophy.  From this view 
we understand the altered position of the Indian question in the present year, 
1853,  compared  with  all  former  periods  of  Charter  renewal. 

Again,  let  us  take  a  different  view.  We  shall  still  better  understand  the 
peculiar crisis  in Indian legislation,  on reviewing the course  of British com- 
mereiai  intercourse  with  India  through  its  different  phases. 

5 

At the  commencement of the  East-India Company's operations, under the 
reign of Elizabeth, the Company was  permitted for the  purpose of profitably 
carrying on its trade  with India, to export an annual value of £30,000in silver, 
gold,  and foreign  coin.  This  was  an infraction  against  all  the  prejudices  of  10 
the  age,  and  Thomas  Mun was forced to lay down in "A Discourse on Trade 
from England to the East Indies," the foundation of the "mercantile system," 
admitting  that the  precious  metals were the only real wealth a country could 
possess,  but  contending  at  the  same  time  that  their  exportation  might  be 
safely  allowed,  provided  the  balance  of payments was  in  favor  of  the  ex- 
porting  nation.  In  this  sense,  he  contended  that  the  commodities  imported 
from  East  India  were  chiefly  reexported  to  other  countries,  from  which  a 
much greater quantity of bullion was  obtained than had been required to  pay 
for  them  in  India.  In  the  same  spirit,  Sir  Joshua  Child  wrote  "A  Treatise 
wherein  it  is  demonstrated  that  the  East  India  Trade  is  the  most  national  20 
Trade  of  all  Trades."  By-and-by  the  partisans  of  the  East  India  Company 
grew  more  audacious,  and  it  may  be  noticed  as  a  curiosity,  in  this  strange 
Indian  history,  that  the  Indian  monopolists  were  the  first preachers  of  free 
trade  in  England. 

15 

Parliamentary  intervention,  with regard  to  the  East India Company, was  25 

again claimed, not by the commercial, but by the industrial class, at the latter 
end  of  the  17th  century,  and  during  the  greater  part  of  the  18th,  when  the 
importation  of  East  Indian  cotton  and  silk  stuffs  was  declared  to  ruin  the 
poor  British  manufacturers,  an  opinion  put  forward  in  "John  Pollexfen: 
England and India inconsistent in their Manufactures; London,  1697," a title  30 
strangely  verified  a  century  and  a  half  later,  but  in  a  very  different  sense. 
Parliament did then interfere.  By the  Act  11  and  12  William HI., cap. 10, it 
was  enacted that the wearing of wrought silks and of printed or dyed calicoes 
from  India,  Persia  and  China  should  be  prohibited,  and  a  penalty  of  £200 
imposed on all persons having or selling the same. Similar laws were enacted  35 
under  George  I.,  II.  and  III.,  in  consequence  of  the  repeated  lamentations 
of  the  afterward  so  "enlightened"  British  manufacturers.  And thus,  during 
the  greater  part  of  the  18th  century,  Indian  manufactures  were  generally 
imported  into  England  in  order  to  be  sold  on  the  Continent,  and to remain 
excluded from the  English  market itself. 

40 

Besides  this  Parliamentary  interference  with  East  India,  solicited  by  the 

190 

The  East  India  Company—Its  History  and  Results 

5 

greedy  home manufacturer,  efforts were made  at every epoch of the renewal 
of  the  Charter, by the merchants of London, Liverpool and Bristol, to break 
down  the  commercial monopoly  of  the  Company,  and  to  participate  in that 
commerce,  estimated  to  be  a  true  mine  of  gold.  In  consequence  of  these 
efforts,  a provision was  made  in the  Act of  1793  prolonging the  Company's 
Charter  till  March  1,1814,  by which private British individuals were author 
ized  to  export from, and the Company's Indian servants permitted to import 
into  England,  almost  all  sorts  of  commodities.  But  this  concession  was 
surrounded  with  conditions  annihilating its  effects, in respect to the exports 
to  British  India by private  merchants.  In  1813  the  Company was unable to 
further  withstand  the pressure  of  general  commerce,  and  except the  mono 
poly  of  the  Chinese  trade,  the  trade  to  India  was  opened,  under  certain 
conditions,  to  private  competition.  At  the  renewal  of  the  charter  in  1833, 
these  last restrictions  were  at  length  superseded, the Company forbidden to 
15  carry  on  any  trade  at  all—their  commercial  character  destroyed,  and their 
privilege  of  excluding  British  subjects  from  the  Indian  territories  with 
drawn. 

10 

Meanwhile  the  East  India  trade  had  undergone  very  serious  revolutions, 
altogether  altering the position of the different class interests in England with 
regard to it. During the whole course of the  18th century the treasures trans 
ported  from  India  to  England  were  gained  much  less  by  comparatively 
insignificant  commerce,  than by  the  direct  exploitation of  that  country, and 
by  the  colossal  fortunes  there  extorted  and  transmitted  to  England.  After 
the  opening of  the  trade  in  1813  the  commerce with India more than trebled 
in  a  very  short time.  But this  was  not all.  The whole character of the trade 
was  changed.  Till  1813  India  had  been  chiefly  an  exporting  country,  while 
it now became an importing one ; and in such a quick progression, that already 
in  1823 the rate of exchange, which had generally been 2s. 6d. per rupee, sunk 
down to  2s.  per rupee.  India,  the great  workshop of cotton  manufacture for 
the  world,  since  immemorial  times,  became  now  inundated  with  English 
twists  and  cotton  stuffs.  After  its  own  produce  had  been  excluded  from 
England,  or  only  admitted  on  the  most  cruel  terms,  British  manufactures 
were  poured  into  it  at  a  small  and  merely  nominal  duty,  to  the  ruin  of  the 
native cotton fabrics once  so celebrated.  In  1780 the value of British produce 
and  manufactures  amounted  only  to  £386,152,  the  bullion  exported  during 
the  same  year  to  £15,041,  the  total  value  of  exports  during  1780  being 
£12,648,616, so that the India trade amounted to only V32 of the entire foreign 
trade.  In  1850 the  total  exports  to  India from Great Britain and Ireland were 
£8,024,000,  of  which  cotton  goods  alone  amounted  to  £5,220,000,  so  that it 
reached  more  than  Vs  of  the  whole  export,  and more  than  lU of the foreign 
cotton  trade.  But,  the  cotton  manufacture  also  employed  now  78  of  the

population  of  Britain,  and  contributed  V1 2th  of  the whole  national revenue. 
After  each commercial  crisis  the  East Indian trade grew of more paramount 
importance for the British cotton manufacturers and the East India Continent 
became  actually  their  best  market.  At  the  same  rate  at  which  the  cotton 
manufactures  became  of  vital  interest  for  the  whole  social  frame  of  Great 
Britain,  East  India  became  of  vital  interest for the  British cotton  manufac 
ture.

Till then the  interests  of the moneyocracy which had converted India into 
its landed estates, of the oligarchy who had conquered it by their armies, and 
of  the  millocracy who had inundated it with their fabrics, had gone hand in  10 
hand.  But  the  more  the  industrial  interest became  dependent on the  Indian 
market,  the  more  it  felt  the  necessity  of  creating fresh  productive  powers 
in  India,  after  having  ruined  her  native  industry.  You  cannot  continue  to 
inundate  a  country with your manufactures, unless you enable it to  give you 
some produce in return. The industrial interest found that their trade declined 
instead  of  increasing.  For  the  four  years  ending  with  1846,  the  imports  to 
India  from  Great  Britain  were  to  the  amount  of 261  million rupees;  for the 
four  years  ending  1850  they  were  only  253  millions,  while  the  exports  for 
the  former  period  274  millions  of  rupees,  and  for  the  latter  period 
254  millions.  They found  out  that  the  power of consuming their goods  was  20 
contracted in India to the lowest possible point, that the consumption of their 
manuf actures by the British West Indies, was of the value of about 14s. per 
head  of  the  population per  annum,  by  Chili,  of  9s.  3.,  by  Brazil  of  6s.  5d., 
by  Cuba,  of  6s.  2d.,  by  Peru  of  5s.  7d.,  by  Central-America  of  10d.,  while 
it  amounted  in India  only to  about 9d.  Then  came  the  short cotton  crop in  25 
the  United  States, which caused them a loss of £11,000,000 in 1850, and they 
were  exasperated at depending on America, instead of deriving a sufficiency 
of  raw  cotton from  the  East  Indies.  Besides,  they found  that  in  all  attempts 
to  apply  capital  to  India they  met  with  impediments  and  chicanery  on the 
part of the India authorities. Thus India became the battle-field in the contest  30 
of  the  industrial  interest  on  the  one  side,  and  of  the  moneyocracy  and  oli 
garchy  on  the  other.  The  manufacturers,  conscious  of  their  ascendency  in 
England,  ask now for the  annihilation of these antagonistic powers in India, 
for  the  destruction  of  the  whole  ancient  fabric  of  Indian  government,  and 
for the  final  eclipse  of the  East-India Company. 

35 

And  now  to  the  fourth  and  last  point  of  view,  from  which  the  Indian 
question must be judged.  Since  1784 Indian finances have got more and more 
deeply into difficulty.  There exists  now  a national debt of 50 million pounds, 
a  continual  decrease  in the  resources  of  the  revenue,  and  a  corresponding 
increase  in  the  expenditure, dubiously balanced by the  gambling income  of  40 
the  opium  tax,  now  threatened  with  extinction  by  the  Chinese  beginning

themselves  to  cultivate  the  poppy,  and  aggravated  by  the  expenses  to  be 
anticipated  from  the  senseless  Burmese  war.  "As  the  case  stands,"  says 
Mr. Dickinson,  "as  it would  ruin  England  to  lose  her  Empire  in  India,  it  is 
threatening  our  own  finances  with  ruin,  to  be  obliged  to  keep  it." 

I have  shown thus, how  the  Indian question has  become  for the first time 

since  1783,  an  English  question,  and  a  ministerial  question.

The Indian Question—Irish Tenant Right. 

Correspondence  of  The  N.Y.Tribune. 

London, June  28,  1853. 

The  debate  On  Lord  Stanley's  motion  with respect to  India commenced on 
the 23d, continued on the 24th,  and adjourned to the 27th inst., has not been 
brought to a close. When that  shall at length have arrived, I intend to resume 
my  observations  on  the  India  question.

As  the  Coalition-Ministry  depends  on  the  support of the  Irish party,  and 
as  all the  other  parties  composing the  House of Commons  so nicely balance 
each other that the  Irish may at any moment turn the  scales which way they  10 
please,  some  concessions  are  at  last  about  to  be  made  to the Irish tenants. 
The  "Leasing Powers  (Ireland) Bill,"  which passed  the  House of Commons 
on  Friday last,  contains  a provision that for  the improvements  made  on the 
soil  and  separable  from  the  soil,  the  tenant  shall have  at the  termination of 
his  lease,  a compensation in money, the incoming tenant being at liberty to  15 
take  them  at  the  valuation,  while  with  respect  to  improvements  in the  soil, 
compensation  for  them  shall  be  arranged  by  contract between the  landlord 
and  the  tenant. 

A  tenant  having  incorporated  his  capital,  in  one  form  or  another,  in  the 
land,  and  having  thus  effected  an  improvement  of  the  soil,  either  directly  20 
by irrigation, drainage, manure, or indirectly by construction of buildings for 
agricultural  purposes,  in  steps  the  landlord  with demand for increased rent. 
If  the  tenant  concede,  he  has  to  pay  the  interest  for  his  own  money to  the 
landlord.  If he resist, he will be very unceremoniously ejected, and supplant 
ed by a new  tenant, the  latter  being enabled  to  pay a higher rent by the very  25 
expenses incurred by his predecessors, until he also, in his turn, has become 
an  improver  of  the  land,  and  is  replaced  in  the  same  way,  or put on worse

terms.  In  this  easy  way  a class  of  absentee  landlords  has  been  enabled  to 
pocket,  not merely the labor, but also the capital, of whole generations, each 
generation  of Irish peasants  sinking a grade lower in the  social scale, exactly 
in  proportion  to  the  exertions  and  sacrifices  made  for  the  raising  of  their 
condition  and  that  of  their  families.  If  the  tenant  was  industrious  and  en 
terprising,  he  became  taxed  in  consequence  of  his  very  industry  and  en 
terprise.  If,  on the  contrary,  he  grew inert and negligent, he was reproached 
with the  "aboriginal faults of the Celtic race."  He had, accordingly, no other 
alternative  left  but  to  become  a  pauper—to  pauperise  himself  by  industry, 

10  or to pauperise by negligence.  In order to oppose this  state of things, "Ten 
ant-Right"  was  proclaimed  in  Ireland—a right  of  the  tenant,  not  in  the  soil 
but  in  the  improvements  of the  soil effected at his  cost  and charges.  Let us 
see  in  what  manner  The  Times,  in  its  Saturdays  leader,  attempts  to  break 
down  this  Irish  "Tenant-Right": 

15 

"There  are  two general systems of farm occupation.  Either a tenant may 
take  a  lease  of  the  land  for  a  fixed  number  of years,  or his  holding  may be 
terminable  at  any  time  upon  certain  notice.  In  the  first  of  these  events,  it 
would be  obviously his  course to  adjust  and  apportion his outlay  so that all, 
or  nearly  all,  the  benefit would find  its  way  to  him before  the  expiration of 
20  his term.  In the  second case it  seems  equally  obvious that he should not run 

the  risk  of  the  investment  without  a  proper  assurance  of  return." 

Where the landlords have to deal with a class of large capitalists who may, 
as they please, invest their stock in commerce, in manufactures or in farming, 
there  can  be  no  doubt  but  that  these  capitalist  farmers,  whether  they  take 
long leases or no time leases  at all, know how to secure the "proper" return 
of  their outlays. But with regard to Ireland the  supposition is  quite fictitious. 
On  the  one  side,  you  have  there  a  small  class  of  land  monopolists,  on  the 
other, a very large class of tenants with very petty fortunes, which they have 
no  chance  to  invest  in  different  ways,  no  other  field of  production  opening 
to  them,  except  the  soil.  They  are,  therefore,  forced  to  become  tenants-
at-will.  Being once tenants-at-will, they naturally run the risk of losing then-
revenue, provided they do not invest their small capital.  Investing it, in order 
to  secure  their  revenue,  they  run  the  risk  of  losing  their  capital,  also. 

"Perhaps,"  continues  The  Times,  "it  may  be  said,  that  in  any  case  a 
tenantry could hardly  expire without  something being left upon the ground, 
in  some  shape  or  another, representing the  tenant's  own property,  and that 
for  this  compensation  should  be  forthcoming.  There  is  some  truth  in  the 
remark,  but  the  demand  thus  created  ought,  under  proper  conditions  of 
society, to be easily adjusted between landlord and tenant, as it might, at any 
rate,  be provided  for  in the original contract. We  say that the conditions of 
society  should  regulate  these  arrangements,  because  we  believe  that  no 

25 

30 

35 

40 

195 

Karl Marx 

Parliamentary  enactment  can  be  effectually  substituted  for  such  an 
agency." 

5 

Indeed,  under  "proper  conditions  of  society,"  we  should  want  no  more 
Parliamentary interference with the Irish land-tenant,  as we should not want, 
under  "proper conditions  of  society," the interference  of the  soldier, of the 
policeman,  and  of  the  hangman.  Legislature,  magistracy,  and  armed force, 
are  all of them but the offspring of improper conditions of society, preventing 
those  arrangements  among  men which  would  make useless the  compulsory 
intervention  of  a  third  supreme  power.  Has,  perhaps,  The  Times been con 
verted  into  a  social  revolutionist?  Does  it  want  a  socia/  revolution,  re-  10 
organizing  the  "conditions  of  society,"  and  the  "arrangements"  emanating 
from  them,  instead  of  "Parliamentary  enactments?"  England has subverted 
the  conditions  of  Irish  society.  At  first  it  confiscated  the  land,  then it  sup 
pressed the industry by "Parliamentary enactments,"  and lastly, it broke the 
active  energy  by  armed force.  And  thus  England  created those  abominable  15 
"conditions  of  society"  which  enable  a  small  caste of rapacious lordlings to 
dictate  to  the  Irish people  the terms  on which they  shall be  allowed to  hold 
the  land  and  to  live upon  it.  Too  weak yet for  revolutionizing those  "social 
conditions," the people  appeal to Parliament, demanding at least their mitiga 
tion and regulation. But " N o ," says The Times; if you don't live under proper 20 
conditions  of  society,  Parliament  can't  mend  that.  And  if  the  Irish  people, 
on  the  advice  of  The  Times,  tried  to-morrow  to  mend  their  conditions  of 
society,  The  Times would be  the  first to appeal to bayonets, and to pour out 
sanguinary  denunciations  of  "the  aboriginal  faults  of  the  Celtic  race," 
wanting the Anglo-Saxon taste for pacific progress and legal amelioration. 

25 

"If  a landlord,"  says  The  Times,  "deliberately injures  one  tenant,  he  will 
find it  so much the harder to get another, and whereas his occupation consists 
in  letting  land,  he  will  find  his  land  all  the  more  difficult  to  let." 

The  case  stands  rather  differently  in Ireland.  The  more  a landlord injures 
one tenant, the easier he will find it to oppress another. The tenant who comes  30 
in, is the means  of  injuring the ejected one, and the ejected one is the means 
of keeping down the new occupant. That, in due course of time, the landlord, 
beside  injuring  the  tenant,  will  injure  himself  and  ruin  himself,  is  not  only 
a probability,  but the  very fact,  in Ireland—a fact affording, however,  a very 
precarious  source  of  comfort to  the  ruined tenant. 

35 

"The  relations  between  the  landlord  and  tenant  are  those  between  two 
traders,"  says  The  Times.  This  is  precisely  the  petitio principii which  per 
vades  the  whole  leader  of  The  Times.  The  needy  Irish tenant belongs to  the 
soil,  while  the  soil  belongs  to  the  English  Lord.  As  well  you might call the 
relation  between  the  robber  who  presents  his  pistol,  and  the  traveler  who  40 
presents  his  purse,  a  relation  between  two  traders. 

196 

The  Indian  Question—Irish  Tenant  Right 

"But,"  says  The  Times,  "in point of fact,  the  relation  between Irish land 
lords  and tenants  will  soon be  reformed by  an agency more potent than that 
of  legislation.  The  property  of  Ireland  is  fast  passing  into  new  hands, and, 
if  the  present  rate  of  emigration continues,  its  cultivation must undergo  the 
same  transfer." 

5 

Here,  at least,  The  Times has  the  truth.  British Parliament  does not inter 
fere  at  a  moment  when  the  worked-out  old  system  is  terminating  in  the 
common  ruin,  both of  the  thrifty landlord  and  the  needy tenant,  the  former 
being  knocked  down  by  the  hammer  of  the  Encumbered  Estates  Com 
ió  mission,  and the latter  expelled by  compulsory emigration.  This reminds  us 
of the  old  Sultan of  Morocco.  Whenever there was  a case pending between 
two  parties,  he  knew  of  no  more  "potent  agency"  for  settling  their  con 
troversy,  than  by  killing  both  parties. 

"Nothing  could  tend,"  concludes  The  Times with regard to  Tenant Right, 
"to  greater  confusion  than  such  a  communistic  distribution  of  ownership. 

15 

The  only  person with  any  right  in  the  land,  is  the  landlord." 

25 

The  Times  seems  to  have  been  the  sleeping  Epimenides  of  the  past half 
century,  and never to  have  heard  of  the  hot controversy going  on  during all 
that  time  upon  the  claims  of  the  landlord,  not  among  social  reformers  and 
20  Communists, but among the very political economists of the British middle-
class.  Ricardo,  the creator of modern political economy in Great Britain, did 
not  controvert  the  "right"  of  the  landlord,  as  he  was  quite  convinced  that 
their  claims  were  based  upon  fact,  and  not  on  right,  and  that  political 
economy in general had nothing to do with questions of right; but he attacked 
the  land-monopoly in a more unassuming, yet more  scientific, and therefore 
more  dangerous  manner.  He  proved  that  private  proprietorship  in  land,  as 
distinguished  from  the  respective  claims  of  the  laborer,  and  of  the  farmer, 
was  a  relation  quite  superfluous  in,  and  incoherent  with  the  whole  frame 
work of modern production; that the  economical expression of that relation-
ship  and  the  rent  of  land,  might,  with great  advantage  be  appropriated  by 
the  State;  and  finally  that  the  interest  of  the  landlord  was  opposed  to  the 
interest of all other classes of modern society. It would be tedious to enumer 
ate  all  the  conclusions  drawn  from  these  premises  by  the  Ricardo  School 
against  the  landed  monopoly.  For  my  end,  it  will  suffice  to  quote  three  of 
the  most recent economical  authorities  of  Great  Britain.

The  London  Economist,  whose  chief  editor,  Mr.  J.Wilson,  is  not  only  a 
Free  Trade-oracle,  but  a  Whig  one,  too,  and  not  only  a  Whig,  but  also  an 
inevitable  Treasury-appendage  in  every  Whig  or  composite  ministry,  has 
contended  in  different  articles  that exactly  speaking there  can  exist  no  title 
to  authorizing  any  individual,  or  any  number  of  individuals,  to  claim  the  ex 

clusive  proprietorship  in  the  soil  of  a  nation. 

197 

Karl Marx 

Mr.  Newman,  in  his  "Lectures  on  Political  Economy,  London,  1851," 

professedly  written  for  the  purpose  of  refuting  Socialism,  tells  us: 

"No  man  has,  or  can  have,  a  natural  right  to  land,  except  so  long  as  he 
occupies  it  in  person.  His  right  is  to  the  use,  and  to the use  only.  All other 
right  is  the  creation  of  artificial  law  (or  parliamentary  enactments  as  The 
Times  would  call  it.)  . ..  If,  at  any  time,  land becomes  needed  to  live  upon, 
the  right  of  private  possessors  to  withhold  it  comes  to  an  end." 

5 

This  is  exactly  the  case  in  Ireland,  and Mr.  Newman expressly confirms 
the  claims  of  the  Irish  tenantry,  and in lectures held before the  most  select 
audiences  of the  British aristocracy. 

10 

In  conclusion  let  me  quote  some  passages  from  Mr.  Herbert  Spencer's 
work,  "Social  Statics,  London,  1851,"  also,  purporting  to  be  a  complete 
refutation  of  Communism,  and  acknowledged  as  the  most  elaborate  de 
velopment  of  the  Free  Trade  doctrines  of  modern  England.

Thus, from the very point of view of modern English political economists, 
it is not the usurping English landlord, but the Irish tenants and laborers, who 
have  the  only  right  in  the  soil  of  their  native  country,  and  The  Times,  in

Russian Policy Against Turkey. 

Correspondence  of  The  N.Y.Tribune. 

London,  Friday, July  1,  1853. 

Since the year 1815 the Great Powers of Europe have feared nothing so much 
as  an  infraction  of  the  status  quo.  But  any  war  between  any  two  of  those 
powers  implies  subversion of  that status quo. That is the reason why Russia's 
encroachments  in the  East have been tolerated, and why  she has never been 
asked for  anything in return but to  afford  some  pretext, however absurd, to 
the Western powers, for remaining neutral,  and for being saved the necessity 
of  interfering  with  Russian  aggressions.  Russia  has  all  along been glorified 
for the forbearance  and generosity  of her "august master,"  who has not only 
condescended  to  cover  the  naked  and  shameful  subserviency  of  Western 
Cabinets, but has  displayed the magnanimity of devouring Turkey piece after 
piece,  instead  of  swallowing  it  at  a  mouthful.  Russian  diplomacy  has  thus 
rested  on  the  timidity  of  Western  statesmen,  and  her  diplomatic  art  has 
gradually  sunk into  so  complete  a mannerism,  that you may trace  the  history 
of  the  present  transactions  almost  literally  in  the  annals  of  the  past. 

The  hollowness  of the new pretexts of Russia is  apparent, after the Sultan 
has  granted,  in his new firman to the Patriarch of Constantinople,  more than 
the  Czar  himself  had  asked  for—so  far as  religion goes.  Now was, perhaps, 
the  "pacification  of  Greece"  a  more  solid  pretext?  When  M.  de  Villèle,  in 
order  to  tranquilize  the  apprehensions  of the  Sultan,  and to  give  a proof of 
the  pure  intentions  of  the  Great  Powers,  proposed  "that  the  allies  ought 
above  all  things  to  conclude  a  Treaty  by which  the  actual  status  quo of  the 
Ottoman  Empire  should  be  guaranteed  to  it,"  the  Russian  Ambassador  at 
Paris  opposed  this  proposition  to  the  utmost,  affirming  "that  Russia,  in 
displaying  generosity  in  her  relations  with  the  Porte,  and  in  showing  in-

appreciable  respect for  the  wishes  of  her  allies,  had been obliged,  neverthe 
less,  to  reserve  exclusively  to herself to  determine her own  differences with 
the  Divan;  that  a  general  guarantee  of the  Ottoman Empire, independently 
of  its  being  unusual  and  surprising,  would  wound  the  feelings  of his  master 
and the rights acquired by Russia,  and the principles upon which they were 
founded." 

Russia pretends now to occupy the Danubian principalities, without giving 

to  the  Porte  the  right  of  considering  this  step  as  a  casus  belli. 

Russia pretended, in  1827,  "to  occupy Moldavia and Wallachia in the name 
of  the  three  Powers." 
While  Russia  proclaimed  the  following  in  her  declaration  of  war  of 

5 

10 

April  26,1828: 

"Her  allies  would  always  find  her  ready  to  concert her  march with them, 
in  execution  of  the  Treaty  of  London,  and  ever  anxious  to  aid  in  a  work, 
15  which  her  religion  and  all  the  sentiments  honorable  to  humanity  recom 
mended  to  her  active  solicitude,  always  disposed  to  profit  by  her  actual 
position  o n ly  for  the  purpose  of  accelerating  the  accomplishment  of  the 
Treaty  of  July  6th,"  while  Russia  announced  in  her  manifesto,  A . D.  1st 
October,  1829:  "Russia  has  remained  constantly  a  stranger  to  every desire 
20  of  conquest—to  every  view  of  aggrandizement."  Her  Ambassador  at  Paris 
was writing to Count Nesselrode.  "When the Imperial Cabinet examined the 
question, whether it had become expedient to take up arms against the Porte, 
there  might  have  existed  some  doubt  about  the  urgency  of this measure  in 
the  eyes  of  those  who  had  not  sufficiently  reflected  upon  the  effects  of the 
25  sanguinary  reforms,  which  the  Chief  of  the  Ottoman  Empire  has  just  execut 

ed  with  such  tremendous  violence  . .. 

The  Emperor  has  put  the  Turkish  system  to  the  proof,  and  His  Majesty 
has  found  it  to  possess  a  commencement  of  physical  and  moral  organization 
which  it hitherto  had not.  If  this  Sultan  had  been  enabled  to  offer us  a more 
30 determined and regular resistance, while he had scarcely assembled together 
the  elements  of  his  new  plan  of  reform  and  ameliorations,  how  formidable 
should  we  have  found  him  had  he  had  time  to give it more  solidity.  Things 
being  in  this  state,  we  must  congratulate  ourselves  upon  having  attacked 
them before  they  became  more  dangerous for us, for delay would only have 
35  made  our  relative  situation  worse,  and  prepared  us  greater  obstacles  than 

those  with  which  we  meet." 

Russia  proposes  now  to  make  an  aggressive  step  and  then  to  talk  about 

it.  In  1829  Prince  Liewen  wrote  to  Count  Nesselrode: 

40 

"We  shall  confine  ourselves  to  generalities,  for  every  circumstantial 
communication on a  subject  so  delicate would draw down real dangers, and 
if  once  we  discuss  with  our  allies  the  articles  of  treaty  with  the  Porte,  we 

201 

Karl Marx 

shall only content them when they will imagine that they have imposed upon 
us  irreparable  sacrifices.  It is  in  the  midst  of  our  camp  that peace must be 
signed  and  it  is  when  it  shall  have  been  concluded that Europe  must know 
its  conditions.  Remonstrances will then be too late  and it will then patiently 
suffer what it can no  longer prevent." 

Russia  has  now  for  several  months  been  delaying  action  under  one  pre 
tence  or  another,  in order to  maintain  a  state  of things, which, being neither 
war  nor  peace,  is  tolerable  to  herself,  but  ruinous  to  the  Turks.  She  acted 
in precisely the  same  manner in the  period  we have  alluded to.  As Pozzo  di 
Borgo  said: 

"It  is  our  policy  to  see  that  nothing  new  happens  during  the  next  four 
months  and  I  hope  we  shall  accomplish  it,  because  men  in  general prefer 
waiting;  but  the  fifth  must  be  fruitful  in  events." 

5 

10 

The  Czar,  after  having  inflicted  the  greatest  indignities  on  the  Turkish 
Government,  and  notwithstanding  that  he  now threatens  to extort by force 
the  most  humiliating  concessions,  nevertheless  raises  a  great cry  about bis 
"friendship  for the  Sultan Abdul  Medjed"  and his  solicitude  "for the preser 
vation of the Ottoman Empire." On the Sultan he throws the "responsibility" 
of  opposing  his  "just  demands,"  of continuing to "wound his friendship and 
his feelings," of rejecting his  "note," and of declining his "protectorate." 

15 

20 

In  1828,  when  Pozzo  di  Borgo  was  interpellated by  Charles X.  about the 
bad  success  of  the  Russian  arms  in  the  campaign  of  that  year,  he  replied, 
that,  not  wishing to  push  the  war  à  outrance without absolute necessity, the 
Emperor  had  hoped  that  the  Sultan  would  have  profited  by  his  generosity, 
which  experiment had now failed. 

25 

Shortly  before  commencing  the  present  quarrel  with  the  Porte  Russia 
sought  to  bring  about  a general coalition of the  Continental Powers  against 
England,  on the  Refugee  question,  and  having failed in that experiment,  she 
attempted to  bring  about  a coalition with England against France.  Similarly, 
from  1826  to  1829,  she  intimidated  Austria  by  the  "ambitious  projects  of  30 
Prussia"  doing  simultaneously,  all that was  in her power to  swell the power 
and pretensions  of Prussia, in order to  enable her to balance  Austria. In her 
present  circular  note  she  indicts  Bonaparte  as  the  only  disturber  of  peace 
by  his  pretensions  respecting  the  Holy  Places;  but,  at  that time, in the lan 
guage  of  Pozzo  di  Borgo,  she  attributed  "all  the  agitation  that  pervaded  35 
Europe  to  the  agency  of  Prince  Metternich,  and  tried to make  the Duke  of 
Wellington himself  perceive  that the deference which he would have for the 
Cabinet of  Vienna would be  a  drawback to  his  influence  with all the others, 
and to give such a turn to things that it would be no longer Russia that sought 
to  compromise  France  with  Great  Britain,  but  Great  Britain  who  had  re-  40 
pudiated  France,  in  order  to  join  the  Cabinet  of  Vienna."

Russia would  now  submit to  a great humiliation if she retreated. That was 
identically  her  situation  after the  first unsuccessful campaign of  1828.  What 
was  then her  supreme  object? We answer in the words of her diplomatist: 

"A  second  campaign  is  indispensable  in  order  to  acquire  the  superiority 
requisite for the  success  of the negotiation. When this negotiation shall take 
place  we  must  be  in  a  state  to  dictate  the  conditions  of  it  in  a prompt  and 
rapid  manner  . ..  With  the power  of doing more  His  Majesty would  consent 
to  demand less.  To  obtain  this  superiority  appears  to  me  what  ought  to  be 
the  aim  of  all  our  efforts.  This  superiority has  now  become  a  condition  of 
our political  existence,  such  as  we  must  establish  and  maintain in the  eyes 

of  the  world." 

But  does  Russia  not  fear  the  common  action  of  England  and  France? 
Certainly.  In  the  Secret  Memoirs  on  the  Means  possessed  by  Russia  for 
breaking up  the  alliance  between  France  and  England,  revealed during the 
reign of  Louis  Philippe,  we  are told: 

"In  the  event  of  a  war,  in  which  England  should  coalesce  with  France, 
Russia  indulges  in  no  hope  of  success,  unless  that union be  broken up;  so 
that  at  the  least  England  should  consent  to  remain  neutral  during  the  con 
tinental  conflict." 

20 

The question is: Does Russia believe in a common action of England and 

France?  We  quote  again  from  Pozzo  di  Borgo's  dispatches: 

"From  the  moment that the  idea of  the  ruin of the Turkish Empire ceases 
to prevail, it is not probable that the British Government would risk a general 
war  for  the  sake  of  exempting  the  Sultan  from  acceding  to  such  or  such 
25 condition, above all in the state in which things will be at the commencement 
of  the  approaching  campaign,  when everything will  be  as  yet uncertain and 
undecided.  These  considerations  would authorize the belief that we have no 
cause  to  fear  an open  rupture  on the  part of  Great  Britain;  and  that  she will 
content herself with counseling the  Porte to  beg peace, and with lending the 
30  aid  of  the good offices  in her power  during the  negotiation if it takes place, 

without  going  further,  should  the  Sultan  refuse  or  we  persist." 

And  as  to  Nesselrode's  opinion of the  "good"  Aberdeen, the  Minister of 
1828,  and  the  Minister  of  1853,  it  may  be  well  to  quote  the  following from 
a  dispatch  by  Prince  Lieven: 

35 

"Lord Aberdeen reiterated in his interview with me the  assurance that at 
no  period it had entered into the intentions of England to  seek a quarrel with 
Russia—that he  feared that the  position of the English Ministry was not well 
understood  at  St.  Petersburg—that  he  found  himself  in  a  delicate  situation. 
Public  opinion was  always  ready  to  burst  forth  against Russia.  The  British 
40  Government  could  not  constantly  b r a ve  it;  and  it  would  be  dangerous  to 
excite  it on questions  that touched  so  nearly  the national prejudices.  On the 

203 

Karl Marx 

other  side  we  could  reckon  with  entire  confidence  upon  the  friendly  dis 
positions  of  the  English  Ministry  which  struggled  against  them." 

The  only  thing  astonishing  in the  note  of  M.  de  Nesselrode,  of  June  11, 
is  not  "The  insolent  mélange  of  professions  refuted  by  acts,  and  threats 
veiled in declaimers," but the reception Russian diplomatica! notes meet with 5 
for  the  first  time  in  Europe,  calling  forth,  instead  of  the  habitual  awe  and 
admiration,  blushes  of  shame  at  the  past  and  disdainful  laughter  from  the 
Western world at this insolent amalgamation of pretensions, finesse  and real 
barbarism.  Yet  Nessehode's  circular  note,  and  the  "ultimatissimum"  of 
June 16, are not a bit worse than the so much admired master-pieces of Pozzo 10 
di  Borgo  and  Prince  Lieven.  Count  Nessekode  was  at  their  time,  what  he 
is  now,  the  diplomatica!  head  of  Russia. 

There is  a facetious  story told of two Persian naturalists who were examin 
ing  a  bear;  the  one  who  had  never  seen  such  an  animal  before,  inquired 
whether  that  animal  dropped its  cubs  alive or laid eggs; to which the other,  15 
who was better informed, replied:  "That animal is capable of anything." The 
Russian bear is  certainly  capable  of  anything,  so  long as he knows the other 
animals  he  has  to  deal  with  to  be  capable  of  nothing. 

En  passant,  I  may  mention  the  signal  victory  Russia  has  just  won  in 
Denmark,  the  Royal  message  having passed  with  a  majority of  119 against  20 
28,  in  the  following terms: 

"In agreement with the 4th paragraph of the Constitution d. d. June 5,1849, 
the  United  Parliament,  for  its  part,  gives  its  consent to  the  arrangement by 
His  Majesty  of the  succession to the whole Danish Monarchy in accordance 
with  the  Royal  message  respecting  the  succession of Oct. 4,1852, renewed  25 
June  13,  1853." 

Strikes  and  combinations  of  workmen  are  proceeding  rapidly,  and  to  an 
unprecedented  extent.  I  have  now  before  me  reports  on  the  strikes  of  the 
factory hands  of  all  descriptions  at Stockport, of smiths, spinners, weavers, 
etc.,  at  Manchester,  of  carpet-weavers  at  Kidderminster,  of  colliers  at the  30 
Ringwood Collieries, near  Bristol, of weavers  and loomers  at Blackburn, of 
loomers  at Darwen, of the cabinet-makers at Boston, of the bleachers, finish 
ers,  dyers  and  power-loom  weavers  of  Bolton  and  neighborhood,  of  the 
weavers  of  Barnsley,  of  the  Spitalfields  broad-silk  weavers,  of  the  lace 
makers  of  Nottingham,  of  all  descriptions  of  workingmen  throughout  the  35 
Bhmingham  district,  and  in  various  other  localities.  Each  mail  brings  new 
reports  of  strikes;  the  turn-out  grows  epidemic.  Every  one  of  the  larger 
strikes, like those at Stockport, Liverpool, etc., necessarily generates a whole 
series of minor strikes, through great numbers of people being unable to carry 
out their resistance to the masters, unless they appeal to the support of their  40 
fellow-workmen  in  the  Kingdom,  and  the  latter,  in  order  to  assist  them, 

204 

Russian  Policy  against  Turkey—Chartism 

asking  in  their  turn  for  higher  wages.  Besides  it  becomes  alike  a  point  of 
honor  and of interest for each locality not to isolate the efforts of their fellow 
workmen  by  submitting  to worse terms,  and thus  strikes  in one  locality are 
echoed  by  strikes  in  the  remotest  other  localities.  In  some  instances  the 
demands for higher wages  are only a settlement of long-standing arrears with 
the  masters.  So  with  the  great  Stockport  strike. 

5 

In  January,  1848,  the  mill-owners  of  the  town  made  a  general  reduction 
of  10  per  cent,  from  all  descriptions  of  factory-workers'  wages.  This  re 
duction was  submitted to  upon the  condition that when trade revived the  10 
io  per cent, was to be restored. Accordingly the work-people memorialized their 
employers,  early  in  March,  1853, for the promised  advance  of  10 per  cent.; 
and  as  they  would  not  come  to  arrangements  with  them,  upward of 30,000 
hands  struck.  In  the  majority  of  instances,  the  factory-workmen  affirmed 
distinctly  their  right to  share in  the prosperity  of the country,  and especially 
in the  prosperity of their  employers. 

15 

The  distinctive feature  of  the  present strikes is this, that they began in the 
lower  ranks  of  unskilled  labor,  (not  factory  labor,)  actually  trained  by  the 
direct influence of emigration, according to various strata of artizans, till they 
reached  at  last  the  factory  people  of  the  great  industrial  centers  of  Great 
20 Britain ; while at all former periods strikes originated regularly from the heads 
of  the  factory-workers,  mechanics,  spinners,  etc.,  spreading  thence  to  the 
lower  classes  of  this  great  industrial  hive,  and  reaching  only  in  the  last 
instance, to the artizans. This phenomenon is to be ascribed solely to emigra 
tion. 

25 

There exists a class of philanthropists, and even of socialists, who consider 
strikes  as  very  mischievous  to  the  interests  of  the  "workingman  himself," 
and whose  great  aim  consists in finding out a method of  securing permanent 
average  wages.  Besides,  the  fact  of  the  industrial  cyclus,  with  its  various 
phases,  putting  every  such  average  wages  out of the  question,  I  am,  on the 
30  very contrary, convinced that the alternative  rise  and fall of wages,  and the 
continual  conflicts between masters  and men resulting therefrom, are, in the 
present  organization  of industry,  the  indispensable means  of holding up the 
spirit  of  the  laboring  classes,  of  combining  them  into  one great association 
against  the  encroachments  of the  ruling  class,  and  of  preventing them from 
35  becoming pathetic, thoughtless, more or less well-fed instruments of produc 
tion.  In a state of society founded upon the antagonism of classes, if we want 
to  prevent  Slavery in fact as well  as  in name,  we must accept war.  In order 
to rightly appreciate the value of strikes and combinations, we must not allow 
ourselves  to  be  blinded  by  the  apparent  insignificance  of  their  economical 
results, but hold, above  all things in view moral and political consequences. 
Without  the  great  alternative  phases  of  dullness,  prosperity,  over-excite-

ment,  crisis  and  distress,  which  modern  industry  traverses  in  periodically 
recurring cycles, with the up  and down of wages resulting from them, as with 
the  constant  warfare  between  masters  and  men closely  corresponding with 
those  variations  in  wages  and profits,  the working-classes  of Great Britain, 
and  of  all  Europe,  would  be  a  heart-broken,  a  weak-minded,  a  worn-out, 
unresisting mass, whose self-emancipation would prove as impossible as that 
of  the  slaves  of Ancient Greece  and Rome.  We  must not forget that  strikes 
and  combinations  among the  serfs were the  hot-beds  of the  mediaeval com 
munes,  and  that those  communes have been in their turn, the  source of life 
of  the  now ruling bourgeoisie.

I observed  in one  of my last letters, of what importance the present labor-
crisis  must turn out to the Chartist movement in England,  which anticipation 
I  now  find  realized  by  the  results  obtained  in  the  first  two  weeks  of  the 
reopened  campaign  by  Ernest  Jones,  the  Chartist  leader.  The  first  great 
open-air  meeting  was,  as  you  know,  to  be  held  on  the  mountain of  Black-  15 
stone-Edge.  On the  19th ult., the  Lancashire and Yorkshire delegates of the 
respective  Chartist  localities  congregated  there,  constituting  themselves  as 
Delegate-Council.  Ernest  Jones's  petition for  the  Charter  was  unanimously 
adopted  as  that proposed  to  emanate  from the meetings in the two counties, 
and  the  presentation of the  Lancashire  and  Yorkshire  petitions  was  voted  20 
to  be  entrusted  to  Mr.  Apsley Pellatt, M.P.  for  Southwark, who  had  agreed 
to  undertake  the  presentation  of  all  Chartist  petitions.  As  to  the  general 
meeting,  the  most  sanguine  minds  did  not  anticipate  its  possibility,  the 
weather  being  terrific,  the  storm  increasing  hourly  in violence  and the rain 
pouring  without  intermission.  At  first  there  appeared  only  a  few  scattered  25 
groups  climbing up  the  hill,  but soon larger-bodies came into  sight, and from 
an eminence that overlooked the  surrounding valleys, thin but steady streams 
of  people  could  be  viewed  as  far  as  the  eye  could  carry,  through  the  base 
pelting of the rain, coming upward along the roads and footpaths leading from 
the  surrounding  country.  By  the  time at which the meeting was  announced  30 
to  commence,  upward of 3,000 people  had met on the  spot, far removed from 
any village or habitation, and during the long speeches, the meeting, notwith 
standing the most violent deluge  of rain, remained steadfast on the ground. 

Mr.  Edward  Hooson's  resolution:  "That  the  social  grievances  of  the 
working  classes  of  the  country  are  the  result  of  class-legislation,  and  that  35 
the  only  remedy  for  such  class-legislation  is  the  adoption  of  the  People's 
Charter,"  was  supported  by  Mr.  Gammage,  of  the  Chartist Executive, and 
Mr.  Ernest  Jones,  from  whose  speeches  I  give  some  extracts. 

"The  resolution which has  been moved attributed the people's grievances 
to  class-legislation.  He thought that no  man who had watched the course of  40 
events could disagree with that statement. The House of Commons, so called, 

206 

Russian  Policy  against  Turkey—Chartism 

5 

10 

had  turned  a  deaf  ear  to  all  their  complaints,  and  when  the  wail  of  misery 
had  arisen from the people, it had been mocked and derided by the men who 
assumed to be the representatives of the nation, and if by any singular chance 
the  voice  of the people  found  an echo  in that house,  it was always drowned 
in  the  clamor  of  the  murderous  majority  of  our  class-legislators.  (Loud 
applause.)  The  House  of  Commons  not  only  refused  to  do  justice  to  the 
people,  but it even refused to inquire into their  social condition. They would 
all  recollect  that  sometime  ago,  Mr.  Slaney  had  introduced  into  the  House 
a  motion  for  the  appointment  of  a  standing  commission,  whose  business  it 
should  be  to  inquire  into  that condition and  suggest measures  of relief—but 
such was  the  determination of the House to evade  the  question,  that on the 
introduction  of  the  motion,  only  twenty-six members  were  present,  and  the 
House was  counted out.  (Loud  cries  of  shame,  shame.)  And on the réintro 
duction  of  that  motion,  so  far  from  Mr.  Slaney  being  successful,  he  (Mr. 
15  Gammage) believed that out of 656 honorable men, but 19 were present even 
to  enter  on  a  discussion  of  the  question.  When  he  told  them  what  was  the 
actual  condition  of  the  people,  he  thought  they  would  agree  with him,  that 
there  existed  abundant  reasons  for  inquiry.  They  were  told  by  Political 
Economists  that  the  annual  production  of  this  country  was  £820,000,000. 
20  Assuming  that  there  were  in  the  United  Kingdom  5,000,000  of  working 
families,  and  that  such  families  received  an  average  income  of  fifteen 
shillings per week, which he believed was a very high average compared with 
what  they  actually  received,  (Cries  of  "a  great  deal  too  high")  supposing 
them,  however,  to  average this  amount, they received out of their enormous 
annual production a miserable one  hundred and  ninety-five millions,—(cries 
of  shame,)—and  all  the  rest went into  the pockets  of idle  landlords, usurers 
and  the  capitalist  class  generally  . ..  Did they  require  a proof that these  men 
were robbers? They were not the worst of thieves who were confined within 
the walls of our prisons; the greatest and cleverest of thieves were those who 
robbed by the power of laws made by themselves, and these large robberies 
were  the  cause  of  all  the  smaller  ones  that  were  transacted throughout the 
country  . ..  Mr.  Gammage  then  entered  into  an  analysis  of  the  House  of 
Commons, proving that from the classes to which the members of that House 
belonged,  and  the  classes  which  they  represented,  it  was  impossible  that 
there  should  exist  the  smallest  sympathy  between  them  and  the  working 
millions. In conclusion,  said the speaker, the people must become acquainted 
withstheir  Social  Rights." 
Mr.  Ernest  Jones,  said: 
"To-day  we  proclaim  that  the  Charter  shall  be  law.  (Loud  cheers.) I ask 
40  you  now  to  reengage  in this great movement, because I know that the time 
has  arrived  for  so  doing,  and  that  the  game  is  in  your  hands,  and  because

I  am  anxious  that you  should not let the  opportunity go by.  Brisk trade  and 
emigration have  given you  a momentary power,  and  upon how  you use that 
power  depends  your  future  position.  If you use it only for the objects of the 
present,  you will  break down when the  circumstances  of the present  cease. 
But if you use  it, not only to  strengthen your present position, but to secure 
your  future  one,  you  will  triumph  over  all your  enemies.  If brisk trade  and 
emigration  give  you  power,  that  power  must  cease  when  brisk  trade  and 
emigration cease,  and unless  you  secure  yourself  in the interval, you will be 
more  slaves  than  ever.  (Hear,  hear.)  But  the  very  sources  that  cause  your 
strength  now  will  cause  your  weakness  before  long.  The  emigration  that  10 
makes  your  labor  scarce,  will make  soon your employment  scarcer  . ..  The 
commercial  reaction will  set  in,  and  now  I  ask you,  how  are  you preparing 
to  meet  it?  You  are  engaged  in  a  noble  labor  movement for  short time  and 
high  wages,  and  you  are  practically  carrying it through to  some  extent, but 
mark!  you  are  not  carrying  it  through  Parliament.  Mark!  the  game  of  the  15 
employer  is  this—amuse  them  with  some  concessions,  but yield to  them  no 
law.  Don't pass a Wages bill in Parliament, but concede some of its provisions 
in the  factory.  (Hear.) The wages  slave will then say, 'Never mind a political 
organization  for  a  Ten  Hours'  bill  or  a  Wages  measure—we've  got  it  by 
ourselves, without Parliament.' Yes, but can you keep it without Parliament? 20 
What gave it you?  Brisk trade.  What will take it from you? Dull trade. Your 
employers  know  this.  Therefore,  they  shorten  your  hours  of  work or raise 
your  wages,  or  remit  their  stoppages,  in  hopes  that  you  will  forego  the 
political  organization  for  these  measures.  (Cheers.)  They  shorten the  hours 
of  work,  well  knowing  that  soon  they  will run their  mills  short time—they  25 
raise  your  wages,  well  knowing  that  soon  they  will  give  thousands  of  you 
no wages at all.  But they tell you also—the midland manufacturers—that, even 
if  the  laws  were passed, this  would only force  them  to  seek other means  of 
robbing  you—that  was  the  plain  meaning  of their words.  So that in the first 
place,  you  can't  get  the  acts  passed,  because  you  have  not got  a People's  30 
Parliament.  In the  second place,  if they  were passed,  they tell you that they 
would  circumvent  them.  (Loud  cries  of  "hear.")  Now,  I  ask  you,  how  are 
you  preparing  for  the  future?  How  are  you  using  the  vast  strength  you 
momentarily possess?  That you will be powerless, unless you prepare now— 
you will loose all you may have gained;  and we are here to-day to show you  35 
how  to  keep  it  and  get  more.  Some  people  fancy  a  Chartist  organization 
would interfere with the Labor movement.  Good Heaven! it is the very thing 
to  make  it  successful  . ..  The  employed  cannot  do  without  the  employer, 
unless  he  can  employ  himself.  The  employed  can  never  employ  himself, 
unless  he can command the  means  of work—land, credit and machinery.  He  40 
can  never  command  these,  unless  he  breaks  down the landed, moneyed and 

208

mercantile  monopolies,  and  these  he  cannot  subvert  except  by  wielding 
sovereign  power.  Why  do  you  seek  a Ten  Hours  bill?  If  political  power  is 
not  necessary  to  secure  labour-freedom  why  go  to  Parliament  at  all?  Why 
not  do  it in  the  factory  at  once?  Why,  because you know,  you feel,  you by 
that  very  act  admit  tacitly,  that  political  power  is  needed  to  obtain  social 
emanicipation.  (Loud cheers.) Then I point you to the foundation of political 
power—I point you to  the  suffrage—I point you to the Charter.  (Enthusiastic 
applause.)...  It may be  said:  'Why do  we  not wait till the  crisis  comes,  and 
the  millions  rally  of  their  own  accord.'  Because  we  want  not  a  movement 
10  of  excitement  and  danger,  but  one  of calm reason  and  moral  strength.  We 
will not see you led away by excitement, but guided by judgment—and there 
fore we bid you now reorganize—that you may rule the storm, instead of being 
tossed  by it. Again, continental revolution will accompany commercial reac 
tion—and  we  need  to  raise  a  strong  beacon  of  Chartism  to  light us through 
the  chaos  of  tempest.  Today,  then,  we  reinaugúrate  our movement, and to 
obtain its  official recognition,  we go through the medium of Parliament—not 
that  we  expect  them  to  grant  the  petition—but  because  we  use  them  as the 
most fitting mouth-piece to announce our resurrection to the world.  Yes, the 
very  men  that  proclaimed  our  death,  shall  have  the  unsought  pleasure  to 
20  proclaim  our  resurrection,  and this petition is  merely the baptismal register 

15 

announcing  to  the  world  our  second  birth."  (Loud  cheers.) 

Mr.  Hooson's resolution and the petition to  Parliament were here, as well 
as  at the  subsequent  meetings during the week, enthusiastically accepted by 
acclamation. 

25  At  the  meeting  of  Blackstone  Edge,  Ernest  Jones  had  announced  the  death 
of  Benjamin  Rushton,  a workingman  who  seven years before,  had presided 
at  the  great  Chartist  meeting held  at the  same  spot; and he proposed that his 
funeral  should  be  made  a  great  political  demonstration,  and  be  connected 
with the  West Riding meeting for the adoption of the Charter, as the noblest 
30  obsequies  to  be  given  to  that  expired  veteran.  Never before  in the  annals 
of  British  Democracy,  has  such  a  demonstration  been  witnessed,  as  that 
which  attended  the  revival  of  Chartism in the  West Riding,  and the  funeral 
of  Benjamin Rushton,  on  Sunday last, when upward of 200,000 people were 
assembled  at  Halifax,  a  number  unprecedented  even  in  the  most  excited 
times.  To those who  know nothing of English society but its dull, apoplectic 
surface, it should be recommended to  assist at these workingmen's meetings 
and to look into those  depths where its'destructive elements  are  at  work.

The  Coalition  has  gained  the  preliminary  battle  on  the  Indian  question, 
Lord  Stanley's  motion  for  delay  of  legislation  having  been  rejected  by  a 
40  majority  of  184 votes.  Pressure  of matter obliges  me to delay my comments 

upon that division.

London,  Tuesday,  5th July,  1853. 

The  courier  bearing  the  rejection  of  the  Russian  ultimatissbnum  on the  part 
of Reshid Pasha, reached St. Petersburg on the 24th ult., and, three days later, 
a  messenger  was  dispatched  with  orders  for  Prince  Gorchakoff  to  cross  the 
Pruth,  and to occupy the Principalities.

The  Austrian  government  has  sent  Count  Gyulai  on  an  extraordinary 
mission to the Czar, no doubt with a view of cautioning him against the danger 
of  revolution  lurking  behind  any  general  European  war.  We  may  infer  the 
answer  of  the  Russian  cabinet  in  the  present  instance  from  that  which  it 
returned  to  similar  representations  from  the  same  power in  1829.  It was  as  15 
fojlows:— 

"On this  occasion the  Austrian Cabinet has  reproduced all the motives of 
alarm  created  by  the  fermentation  which,  according  to  its  opinion  and  the 
information  it  possesses,  reigns  in  more  than  one  country,  as  well  as  the 
progress lately made by the revolutionary tendencies. These apprehensions  20 
are more particularly betrayed in the letter of the Emperor Francis to Nicho-
• las.  We are far from denying the dangers which Austria points out to us. Since 
by means  of foreign influence the resistance of the Porte assumes a character 
of  obstinacy  which delays beyond our wishes and our hopes the term of this 
crisis,  and  even  demands  redoubled  efforts  and new  sacrifices  on our part,  25 
Russia will be  forced to  devote  more  than ever her  whole attention to inter-

ests which  so  immediately  affect the  honor  and  the welfare of her subjects; 
from  that  moment  the  means  which  she  could  oppose  to  the  breaking  out 
of  the  revolutionary  spirit  in  the  rest  of  Europe  must  necessarily  be  para 
lyzed.  No  power,  then,  ought  to  be  more  interested  than  Austria  in  the 
conclusion  of  peace,  but  of  a peace  glorious  to  the  Emperor  and  advanta 
geous to his empire. For if the treaty we  should sign did not bear this charac 
ter,  the  political  consideration  and  influence  of  Russia  would  experience 
through  it  a  fatal  blow,  the  prestige  of  her  strength  would  vanish,  and  the 
moral  support  which  she  might  perhaps  be  called  upon  to  lend  in  future 
contingencies  to  friendly  and  allied  powers  would  be  precarious  and  in 
efficacious."  (Secret  dispatch  from  Count  Nesselrode  to  M.  de  Tatistcheff, 
dated  St.  Petersburg,  12th  February,  1829.) 

The Press, of last  Saturday,  stated  that the  Czar,  in his disappointment at 
the  conduct  of  England,  and  more  especially  of  Lord  Aberdeen,  had  in-
structed  M.  de  Brunnow  to  communicate  no  longer  with that  "good,"  old 
man,  but to  restrict himself  to  his  official  intercourse  with the  Secretary for 
Foreign  Affairs. 

The  Vienna  Lloyd,  the  organ  of  the  Austrian  bankocracy,  is  very  de 
terminedly  in  favor  of  Austria  siding  with  England  and  France  for  the 

20  purpose  of  discountenancing the  aggressive  policy  of  Russia. 

You  will  remember  that  the  Coalition  Ministry  suffered  a  defeat  on  the 
14th  of  April,  on the  occasion of the  proposed repeal of the  Advertisement 
duty.  They have  now experienced  two more  defeats,  on the  1st inst., on the 
identical ground.  Mr.  Gladstone  moved on that day to reduce the Advertise-
25  ment Duty from  Is. 6d. to 6d., and to extend it to  advertisements published 
with  any  magazine,  pamphlet,  or  other  literary  work.  Mr.  Milner  Gibson's 
amendment  for  the  repeal of  all duties  now  payable  on advertisements  was 
rejected by  109 against 99 votes. The retainers of Mr. Gladstone thinking that 
victory  had  been won,  left the  House for  dinner  and  a court-ball,  when Mr. 
30  Bright rose and made a very powerful speech against the taxes on knowledge 
in  general,  and  the  Stamp  and Advertisement Duty in particular.  From  this 
speech  I  will  quote  a few  passages  which  may  be  of  interest  to  you: 

"He  (Mr.  Bright)  held  in  his  hand  a  newspaper  which was the  same  size 
as  the  London  daily  newspapers  without  a  supplement,  and it was  as good 
35 a newspaper, he undertook to say, as any published in London. It was printed 
with a finer type  than  any  London  daily  paper. The paper, the material, was 
exceedingly good—quite  sufficient for  all  the  purposes  of  a newspaper.  The 
printing  could  not  be  possibly  surpassed,  and  it  contained  more  matter  for 
its  size  than  any  daily  paper printed in London.  The first,  second  and third 
sides were composed of advertisements. There were  a long article upon the 
American Art-Union investigation,  a leading  article  giving  a  summary of all 

40 

211 

Karl Marx 

5 

10 

the  latest  news from Europe,  a leading article  on the  Fisheries  dispute,  and 
a leading article, with which he entirely concurred, stating that public dinners 
were  public  nuisances.  (Hear,  and  a  laugh.)  He  had  seen  articles  perhaps 
written  with  more  style  but  never  any  that  had  a  better  tone,  or  that were 
more  likely  to  be  useful.  Then  again  there  were  'Three  days  later  from 
Europe,' the  'Arrival of the Asia,' and a condensation from all the news from 
Europe.  From  Great  Britain  there  was  an  elaborate  disquisition  upon  the 
Budget of the Rt. Honorable gentleman, which did him justice in some parts, 
but  not  in  others,  and  which,  so  far  as  the  Manchester  schools  were  con 
cerned, certainly did them no justice whatever. (Laughter.) Then there were 
an  account  of  Mrs.  Stowe's  visit  to  Edinburgh,  a  long  article  from  The 
London  Tunes upon the wrongs  of dressmakers, articles from Greece, Spain 
and  other continental countries, the Athlone election, and the returns of Her 
Majesty's  Solicitor  General  by  exactly  189  votes—which  would  very  much 
surprise  an  American  to  read—several  columns  of  ordinary  news  in  para-  15 
graphs,  and  most  elaborate  mercantile  and  market  tables.  It wrote  steadily 
in  favor  of  Temperance  and  Anti-Slavery,  and he  ventured to  say that there 
was  not at this moment in London a better paper than that. The name of that 
paper  was  The  New-York  Tribune,  and  it  was  laid  regularly  every  morning 
upon  the  table  of  every  workingman of that city who  chose  to  buy it at the 
sum of one penny.  (Hear, hear.) What he wanted to ask the Government was 
this :  How comes it, and for what good end, and by what contrivance of fiscal 
oppression was it that one of our workmen here  should pay 5d. for a London 
morning  paper,  while  his  direct  competitor  in  New  York  could  buy  a paper 
for  Id.?  We were running a race in the face  of all the world with the United  25 
States;  but  if  our  artisans were  to  be  bound either  to  have  no  newspaper  at 
all,  or  to  pay  5d.  for  it,  or were to be  driven to the public houses to read it, 
while  the  artisan  in  the  United  States  could procure  it  for  Id.,  how  was  it 
possible  that  any  fair  rivalry  could  be  maintained  between  the  artisans  of 
the  two  countries? As well  say that a merchant in England, if he never  saw  30 
a  price-current,  would  carry  on  his  business  with  the  same  facility  as  the 
merchant who had that advantage every day.  (Hear, h e a r . ) . .. If the Chancel 
lor  of  the  Exchequer  should  oppose  what  he  had  stated,  he  should tell him 
at  once  and  without  hesitation  that  it  was  because  he  had  a latent dread of 
the liberty of the press ; and when the right honorable gentleman spoke about 35 
financial difficulties,  he  said  it was  but a cloak to  conceal his lurking horror 
lest  the  people  should  have  a  free  press  and  greater  means  of  political  in 
formation.  (Hear.)  It  was  the fear  that the press  would be  free  which made 
them  keep  the  6d.  advertisement  duty  as  the  buttress  to  the  stamp." 

20 

Mr.  Craufurd then moved to  substitute  in lieu of the figure  6d.  the  cipher  40 

Od.  Mr.  Cobden  supported the motion, and in reply to Mr.  Gladstone's state-

212 

The  Turkish  War  Question—"The  New-York  Tribune"  in  the  House  of  Commons—India 

ment, that the Advertisement duty was no question of much importance with 
regard  to  the  circulation  of  cheap  newspapers,  called  his  attention  to  the 
evidence  given  by  Mr.  Horace  Greeley,  who  was  examined  before  the 
Committee  which  had  sat  on  this  subject  in  1851. 

"This  gentleman  was  one  of  the  Commissioners  of  the  great exhibition, 
and he  was  the proprietor  of that very newspaper from which his honorable 
friend,  Mr.  Bright,  had  quoted.  He  was  examined  as  to  what  the  effect  of 
the  advertisement  duty  would  be  in  America,  and  his  reply  was  that  its 
operation  would  be  to  destroy  their  new  papers." 

Lord  John Russell now got up  and  said, in rather angry voice, that it was 
hardly  fair  to  attempt  to  reverse,  in  a greatly  thinned House,  the  decisions 
previously  adopted.  Of  course,  Lord  John did  not recollect  that on the very 
advertisement-duty  his  colleagues  had been beaten before by  a majority  of 
40,  and  had  only  had  now  a  majority  of  10.  Notwithstanding  Lord  John's 
lecture on "constitutional"  fairness, the motion of Mr. Gladstone for a duty 
of  6d.  on  each  advertisement,  was  negatived  by  68  against  63,  and  Mr. 
Craufurd's  amendment carried by 70 against 61.  Mr. Disraeli and his friends 
voted  with  the  Manchester  School.

The  House  of Commons, in order  to do justice to the colossal dimensions 
20  of  the  subject,  has been  spinning out its  Indian debate to  an unusual length 
and breadth, although that debate has failed altogether in depth and greatness 
of  interest.  The  division  leaving  Ministers  a  majority  of  332  against  142, is 
in  inverse  ratio  to  the  discussion.  During the  discussion all was thistles for 
the  Ministry,  and  Sir Charles  Wood was the  ass  officially put to the task of 
feeding upon them. In the division all is roses, and Sir Charles Wood receives 
the  crown  of  another  Manu.  The  same  men  who  negatived  the  plan  of  the 
Ministry by their arguments, affirmed it by their votes. None of its supporters 
dared to  apologise  for the  bill  itself;  on the contrary, all apologized for their 
supporting the  bill,  the  one  because it was an infinitesimal part of a measure 
in the right direction, the others because it was no measure at all. The former 
pretend  that they will now mend it in Committee; the latter  say that they will 
strip  it  of  all  the  fancy  Reform  flowers  it  parades  in. 

30 

The  Ministry  maintained  the  field  by  more  than  one  half  of  the  Tory 
opposition mnning away, and a great portion of the remainder deserting with 
35  H e m es  and  Inglis  into the Aberdeen camp, while of the  142 opposite votes 
100  belonged  to  the  Disraeli  fraction,  and  42  to  the  Manchester  School, 
backed  by  some  Irish  discontents  and  some  inexpressibles.  The  opposition 
within  the  opposition  has  once  more  saved  the  Ministry. 

Mr.  Halliday,  one  of  the  officials  of the  East India Company, when exa-
40  mined  before  a  Committee  of  Inquiry,  stated:  "That  the  Charter  giving  a 
twenty years lease to the East India Company was considered by the natives 

213 

Karl Marx 

of  India  as  farming  them  out."  This  time  at least,  the  Charter  has  not been 
renewed  for  a  definite  period,  but  is  revokable  at will  by  Parliament.  The 
Company,  therefore,  will  come  down  from  the  respectable  situation  of 
hereditary fanners, to  the  precarious  condition of tenants-at-will.  This  is so 
much  gain  for  the  natives.  The  Coalition  Ministry has  succeeded in trans- 
forming the  Indian Government,  like  all other  questions,  into  an open ques 
tion.  The  House  of  Commons,  on  the  other  hand,  has  given  itself  a  new 
testimonial of  poverty,  in confessing by the  same division, its impotency for 
legislating,  and  its  unwillingness  to  delay  legislating.

Since  the  days  of  Aristotle the world has been inundated with a frightful 
quantity  of  dissertations,  ingenious  or  absurd,  as  it  might  happen,  on  that 
question:  Who  shall  be  the  governing power?  But for  the  first  time  in  the 
annals  of history, the  Senate of a people ruling over another people number 
ing  156  millions  of  human beings  and  spreading over  a  surface  of  1,368,113 
square  miles,  have  put  their  heads  together  in  solemn  and  public  con-  15 
gregation,  in  order  to  answer  the  irregular  question:  Who  among  us  is  the 
actual  governing  power  over  that  foreign  people  of  150  millions  of  souls? 
There  was  no Œdipus in the British Senate capable of extricating this riddle. 
The  whole  debate  exclusively twined  around it,  as  although a division took 
place,  no  definition of  the  Indian  Government  was  arrived  at. 

20 

That  there  is  in  India  a permanent financial  deficit,  a regular  over-supply 
of  wars,  and  no  supply  at  all  of  public  works,  an  abominable  system  of 
taxation,  and  a  no  less  abominable  state  of  justice  and  law,  that these five 
items  constitute,  as  it  were,  the five points  of the  East Indian Charter, was 
settled beyond all doubt in the debates of  1853, as it had been in the debates  25 
of  1833,  and in the  debates  of  1813,  as  in  all former  debates  on India.  The 
only  thing  never  found  out,  was  the  party  responsible  for  all  this. 

There  exists,  unquestionably,  a  Governor-General  of  India,  holding  the 

supreme  power, but that  Governor is governed in his turn by a home govern 
ment.  Who  is  that  home  government?  Is  it  the  Indian  Minister,  disguised  30 
under  the  modest  title  of  President  of  the  Board  of  Control,  or  is  it  the 
twenty-four  Directors  of  the  East India Company?  On the  threshold of  the 
Indian  religion  we  find  a  divine  trinity,  and  thus  we  find  a profane  trinity 
on  the  threshold  of  the  Indian  Government. 

Leaving,  for  a  while,  the  Governor-General  altogether  on  one  side,  the  35 

question  at issue  resolves  itself into  that of the  double Government, in which 
form  it  is  familiar  to  the  English mind.  The  Ministers  in  their  bill,  and  the 
House  in  its  division,  cling  to  this  dualism. 

When  the  Company  of  English  merchant  adventurers,  who  conquered 
India to make money out of it, began to enlarge their factories into an empire,  40 
when  their  competition  with  the  Dutch  and  French  private  merchants  as-

214 

Γ 

The  Turkish  War  Question—"The  New-York  Tribune"  in  the  House  of  Commons—India 

sumed  the  character  of  national rivalry, then, of course, the British Govern­
ment  commenced  meddling  with  the  affairs  of the  East India  Company,  and 
the  double  Government  of  India  sprung  up  in fact if not in name.  Pitt's  act 
of  1784,  by  entering  into  a  compromise  with  the  Company,  by  subjecting  it 
to  the  superintendence  of  the  Board  of  Control,  and  by  making  the  Board 
of Control  an appendage  to  the Ministry, accepted, regulated and settled that 
double  Government,  arisen from circumstances, in name  as well as in fact. 

5 

The  act of  1833  strengthened the Board of Control, changed the proprietors 
of the  East India Company into  mere  mortgagees  of the  East India revenues, 

10 

ordered the  Company to sell off its stock, dissolved its commercial existence,, 
transformed  it,  as  far  as  it  existed  politically,  into  a  mere  trustee  of  the 
Crown,  and  did  thus  with the  East India Company, what the  Company  had 
been  in  the  habit  of  doing  with  the  East  India Princes.  After having  super­
seded  them,  it  continued,  for  a  while,  still  to  govern  in  their  name.  So  far, 
the  East  India Company has,  since  1833, no longer existed but in name  and 
on  sufferance.  While  thus  on  one  hand,  there  seems  to  be  no  difficulty  in 
getting rid of the Company altogether, it is, on the other hand, very indifferent 
whether  the  English  nation  rules  over  India  under  the  personal  name  of 
Queen  Victoria,  or  under  the  traditional  firm  of  an  anonymous  society.  The 
20  whole  question,  therefore,  appears  to  turn  about  a  technicality  of  very 

15 

questionable  importance.  Still,  the  thing  is  not  quite  so  plain. 

It  is  to  be  remarked,  in  the  first  instance,  that  the  Ministerial  Board  of 
Control,  residing  in  Cannon-row,  is  as  much  a  fiction  as  the  East  India 
Company,  supposed to reside in Leadenhall-st.  The members  composing the 
25  Board  of  Control  are  a mere  cloak for the  supreme  rule  of the  President of 
the  Board.  The  President  is  himself  but  a  subordinate  though  independent 
member  of  the  Imperial  Ministry.  In  India  it  seems  to  be  assumed that  if  a 
man  is  fit  for  nothing  it  is  best  to  make  him  a Judge,  and  get rid  of  him.  In 
Great  Britain,  when  a  party  comes  into  office  and  finds  itself  encumbered 
30  with  a  tenth-rate  "statesman,"  it  is  considered  best  to  make  him  President 
of  the  Board  of  Control,  successor  of  the  Great  Mogul,  and  in that  way  to 
get  rid  of  him—  teste  Carolo  Wood. 

The  letter  of  the  law  entrusts  the  Board  of  Control,  which is  but  another 
name for its  President, with  "full power and  authority to  superintend,  direct, 
35  and  control  all  acts,  operations  and  concerns  of  the  East  India  Company 
which  in  anywise  relate  to  or  concern  the  Government  or  revenues  of  the 
Indian  territories."  Directors  are  prohibited  "from  issuing  any  orders,  in­
structions,  dispatches,  official  letters,  or  communications  whatever relating 
to  India,  or  to  the  Government thereof,  until  the  same  shall have been sanc-
tioned  by  the  Board."  Directors  are  ordered  to  "prepare  instructions  or 
orders  upon  any  subject  whatever  at  fourteen  days'  notice  from  the  Board, 

40 

215 

Karl Marx 

5 

or else to transmit the orders of the Board on the subject of India. " The Board 
is  authorized to inspect all correspondence  and dispatches to and from India, 
and  the  proceedings  of the  Courts  of Proprietors  and Directors.  Lastly, the 
Court  of  Directors  has  to  appoint  a  Secret  Committee,  consisting  of  their 
Chairman, their Deputy  Chairman and their  senior member, who  are  sworn 
to  secrecy,  and  through  whom,  in  all  political  and  military  matters,  the 
President  of  the  Board  may  transmit his  personal  orders  to  India,  while  the 
Committee  acts  as  a  mere  channel  of  his  communications.  The  orders  re 
specting the  Affghan  and Burmese  wars,  and as to the occupation of Scinde 
were transmitted through this  secret Committee, without the Court of Direc-  10 
tors being  any  more informed of them than the general public or Parliament. 
So  far,  therefore,  the  President  of  the  Board  of  Control would  appear  to  be 
the real  Mogul,  and, under all circumstances, he retains  an unlimited power 
for  doing  mischief,  as,  for  instance,  for  causing  the  most  ruinous  wars,  all 
the  while  being hidden under the name of the irresponsible Court of Direc-  15 
tors.  On  the  other  hand,  the  Court  of  Directors  is  not without  real  power. 
As  they generally exercise the  initiative in administrative  measures, as they 
form,  when  compared  with  the  Board  of  Control,  a  more  permanent  and 
steady  body,  with  traditional  rules  for  action  and  a  certain  knowledge  of 
details, the whole of the  ordinary internal administration necessarily falls to  20 
their  share.  They  appoint,  too,  under  sanction  of  the  Crown,  the  Supreme 
Government  of  India,  the  Governor-General  and  his  Councils;  possessing, 
besides,  the  unrestricted  power  to  recall the highest  servants,  and even the 
Governor-General,  as  they  did  under  Sir  Robert  Peel,  with  Lord  Ellen-
borough.  But this  is  still  not their most important privilege.  Receiving only  25 
£300 per annum,  they  are really paid in patronage, distributing all the writer-
ships  and cadetships, from whose number the Governor-General of India and 
the  Provincial Governors  are obliged  to fill  up all the higher places withheld 
from  the  natives.  When  the  number  of  appointments  for  the  year  is  ascer 
tained,  the  whole  are  divided  into 28  equal parts-of which two  are  allotted  30 
to  the  Chairman  and  Deputy  Chairman,  two  to  the  President  of  the  Board 
of  Control,  and  one to each of the Directors. The annual value of each share 
of  patronage  seldom  falls  short  of  £14,000.  "All  nominations,"  says  Mr. 
Campbell,  "are  now,  as  it  were,  the  private  property  of  individuals,  being 
divided  among  the  Directors,  and  each  disposing of his  share  as  he  thinks  35 
fit."  Now,  it  is  evident that the  spirit of the Court of Directors must pervade 
the  whole  of  the  Indian  Upper  Administration,  trained,  as  it is,  at  schools 
of  Addiscombe  and  Haileybury,  and  appointed,  as  it is, by their patronage. 
It is  no less evident that this Court of Directors, who have to distribute, year 
after  year,  appointments  of  the  value  of  nearly £400,000  among the  upper  40 
classes  of  Great  Britain,  will  find little  or  no  check from  the public  opinion 

216 

The  Turkish  War  Question—"The  New-York  Tribune"  in  the  House  of  Commons—India

directed  by  those  very classes.  What the  spirit of the  Court of Directors  is, 
I will  show in  a following letter  on the  actual  state  of  India.  For the present 
it may suffice to  say that Mr.  Macaulay, in the course of the pending debates, 
defended  the  Court  by  the  particular  plea,  that it was  impotent to  effect  all 
the evils it might intend, so much so, that all improvements had been effected 
in  opposition to  it,  and  against it by  individual  Governors  who  had acted on 
their  own responsibility.  Thus  with regard  to the  suppression of the  Suttee, 
the  abolition  of  the  abominable  transit  duties,  and  the  emancipation of the 
East  India  press. 

10 

The President of the Board of Control accordingly involves  India in ruin 
ous wars under cover of the Court of Directors, while the Court of Directors 
corrupt the Indian Administration under the  cloak of the Board of Control. 

On  looking  deeper  into  the  framework of  this  anomalous  government we 
find  at  its  bottom  a third power, more  supreme  than either  the  Board  or the 
15 Court, more irresponsible, and more concealed from and guarded against the 
superintendence  of  public  opinion.  The  transient  President  of  the  Board 
depends  on  the  permanent  clerks  of  his  establishment  in Cannon-row,  and 
for  those  clerks  India  exists  not  in  India,  but in  Leadenhall-st.  Now, who 
is  the  master  at  Leadenhall-st.? 

20 

Two  thousand persons, elderly ladies  and valetudinarian gentlemen, pos 
sessing Indian  stock, having no other interest in India except to be paid their 
dividends  out  of  Indian  revenue,  elect  twenty-four  Directors,  whose  only 
qualification is the holding of £1,000 stock. Merchants, bankers and directors 
of companies incur great trouble in order to get into the Court for the interest 
25 of their private concerns. "A banker," said Mr. Bright, "in the City of London 
commands 300 votes  of the East India Company, whose word for the election 
of Directors is almost absolute law."  Hence the Court of Directors is nothing 
but  a  succursal  to  the  English  moneyocracy.  The  so-elected  Court  forms, 
in  its  turn,  besides  the  above-mentioned  Secret  Committee,  three  other 
30  Committees,  which  are  1.  Political  and  Military.  2.  Finance  and Home.  3. 
Revenue,  Judicial  and  Legislative.  These  Committees  are  every  year  ap 
pointed  by  rotation,  so  that  a  financier is  one  year  on  the  Judicial  and  the 
next year  on  the  Military  Committee,  and  no  one  has  any chance  of a con 
tinued supervision over a particular department. The mode of election having 
35  brought  in men utterly unfit for their duties,  the  system of rotation gives  to 
whatever  fitness  they  might  perchance  retain,  the  final  blow.  Who,  then, 
govern in fact under the  name  of the Direction?  A large staff of irresponsible 
secretaries,  examiners  and  clerks  at  the  India  House,  of  whom,  as  Mr. 
Campbell  observes,  in  his  Scheme  for  the  Government  of India,  only  one 
individual  has  ever  been  in  India,  and  he  only by  accident.  Apart from the 
trade  in patronage,  it is  therefore  a mere  fiction to  speak of the  politics, the 

40 

217 

Karl Marx 

principles,  and  the  system  of  the  Court  of  Directors.  The  real  Court  of 
Directors  and  the  real  Home  Government,  etc.,  of  India are the permanent 
and  irresponsible  bureaucracy,  "the  creatures  of  the  desk  and the  creatures 
of favor"  residing in  Leadenhall-st.  We  have  thus a Corporation ruling over 
an  immense  Empire,  not  formed,  as  in Venice, by  eminent patricians,  but 
by  old  obstinate  clerks,  and  the  like  odd  fellows. 

5 

No  wonder,  then,  that  there  exists  no  government by  which  so  much  is 
written  and  so Utile  done,  as the  Government of India.  When the East India 
Company  was  only  a  commercial  association,  they,  of  course,  requested  a 
most detailed report on every item from the  managers  of their Indian facto- 
ries,  as  is  done  by  every  trading  concern.  When  the  factories  grew  into  an 
Empire,  the commercial items into  ship loads  of correspondence  and docu 
ments,  the  Leadenhall  clerks  went  on  in  their  system,  which  made  the 
Directors  and  the  Board  their  dependents;  and  they  succeeded  in  trans 
forming  the  Indian  government  into  one  immense  writing  machine.  Lord  15 
Broughton  stated in his evidence before the Official Salaries Committee, that 
with  one  single  dispatch 45,000  pages  of  collection were  sent. 

10 

In order to give you some idea of the time-killing manner in which business 
is  transacted  at  the  India-House,  I  will  quote  a  passage  from  Mr.  Dickin 
son: 

20 

"When  a  dispatch  arrives  from  India,  it  is  referred,  in  the  first instance, 
to  the  Examiners'  Department,  to  which  it  belongs;  after  which  the  chairs 
confer with the  official in charge of that department, and settle with him the 
tenor  of  a reply,  and transmit a draught of this  reply to  the  Indian  Minister, 
in what is  technically called  P.C., i.e. previous communication.  The chairs,  25 
in  this  preliminary  state  of  P.C.  depend  mainly  on  the  clerks.  Such  is  this 
dependence  that  even  in  a  discussion  in  the  Court  of  Proprietors,  after 
previous notice, it is pitiable to  see the chairman referring to a secretary who 
sits  by  his  side,  and  keeps  on  whispering  and  prompting  and  chaffing  him 
as if he were  a mere puppet,  and the  Minister at the other end of the system  30 
is  in  the  same  predicament.  In  this  stage  of  P.C.,  if there  is  a difference  of 
opinion  on  the  draught,  it  is  discussed,  and  almost  invariably  settled  in 
friendly  communication  between  the  Minister  and  the  Chair;  finally  the 
draught  is  returned  by  the  Minister,  either  adopted  or  altered;  and  then  it 
is  submitted  to  the  Committee  of  Directors  superintending the department  35 
to  which it belongs, with all papers bearing on the case, to be considered and 
discussed  and  adopted  or  altered,  and  afterward  it  is  exposed  to  the  same 
process in the aggregate Court, and then goes, for the first time, as an official 
communication  to  the  Minister,  after  which  it  undergoes  the  same  process 
in the  opposite  direction." 

40 

"When  a  measure  is  discussed  in  India,"  says  Mr.  Campbell,  "the  an-

218 

The  Turkish  War  Question—"The  New-York  Tribune"  in  the  House  of  Commons—India 

nouncement  that  it  has  been referred to the  Court  of Directors,  is  regarded 
as  an  indefinite  postponement." 

The  close  and  abject  spirit of  this bureaucracy deserves to be  stigmatised 

in  the  celebrated  words  of  Burke: 

5 

10 

15 

"This tribe of vulgar politicians are the lowest of our  species. There is no 
trade  so vile and mechanical as Government in their hands. Virtue is not then-
habit.  They  are  out  of  themselves  in  any  course  of  conduct  recommended 
only  by  conscience  and  glory.  A  large,  liberal  and  prospective  view  of  the 
interests  of  States  passes  with  them  for  romance;  and  the  principles  that 
recommend it, for the wanderings of a disordered imagination. The calcula 
tors compute them out of their  senses. The jesters  and buffoons  shame them 
out  of  everything  grand  and  elevated.  Littleness  in  object  and  in  means to 
them  appears  soundness  and  sobriety." 

The  clerical  establishments  of  Leadenhall-st.  and  Cannon-row  cost  the 
Indian  people  the trifle  of  £160,000  annually.  The  oligarchy  involves  India 
in wars, in order to find employment for their younger sons ; the moneyocracy 
consigns  it  to  the  highest  bidder;  and  a  subordinate  Bureaucracy  paralyse 
its  administration and perpetuate its abuses as the vital condition of their own 
perpetuation.

Nr. 3826, 22. Juli 1853 

Correspondence  of  The  N.Y.Tribune. 

London,  Friday,  July  8,  1853. 

With  the  actual  occupation  of  the  Danubian  Principalities  and  the  drawing 
near  of the  long-predicted crisis,  the  English Press  has  remarkably lowered 
its  warlike  language,  and  little opposition is made to the advice tendered in 
two  consecutive leaders of  The Tïmesthat, "as the Russians could not master 
their  propensity  for  civilizing  barbarian  provinces,  England  had  better  let 
them  do  as  they  desired,  and  avoid  a  disturbance  of  the  peace  by  vain 
obstinacy."

The anxiety of the Government to withhold all information on the pending 
Turkish question betrayed itself in a most ridiculous farce, acted at the  same 
time  in both Houses  of Parliament.  In the  House  of  Commons  Mr.  Layard, 
the  celebrated  restorer  of  ancient  Nineveh,  had given notice  that he  would 
move  this  evening  that  the  fullest  information  with  regard  to  Turkey  and 
Russia  should be  laid before  the  House.  On this  notice  having been given,  15 
the  following  scene  occured  in  the  lower  House: 

10 

Mr. Layard—The notice of my motion was gjvenf or to-morrow. I received 
a note  yesterday  afternoon asking  me to put off the motion to  Monday,  11th 
inst.  I was  not able to return  an answer yesterday afternoon—in fact, not  till 
this  morning.  To  my  surprise,  I  find that,  without  my  knowledge,  I  was  in  20 
the  House  yesterday;  for  I find from the notices of motions printed with the 
votes, that Mr.  Layard postponed his  motion from Friday the 8th to Monday 
11th!  It  seems  scarcely  fair that independent members  should be treated  in 
this  way. 

Mr.  Gladstone—I do  not know by whose  direction or  authority the  notice  25 

of  postponement  was  placed  on  the  votes  of the  House.  Of one thing I can 
assure  the  hon.  member,  that whatever  was  done,  was  done  in perfect  bona 
fide. 

Mr.  Layard—1  should  like  to  know  who  put that notice  of postponement 

in the paper.  What reason have you for  deferring the  motion to Monday? 

30 

Mr.  Gladstone—An  indisposition  of  Lord  J. Russell. 

220 

Layard's  Motion—Struggle  over the Ten  Hours'  Bill 

Mr.  Layard then  withdrew  his  motion  until  Monday. 
Mr.  Disraeli—This  appears  to  me  an  arrangement  of  business  which re 
quires  explanation on the part of the Government—the  more  so  as the  India 
Bill,  too,  contrary  to  agreement,  is  placed  on the  votes  for  to-morrow. 

5 

After  a pause, 
Sir  C.  Woodhumbly confesses to have been the double sinner, but, availing 
himself of Mr.  Gladstone's suggestion, declared that he had acted with regard 
to  Mr.  Layard  with  the  best  intentions  in  the  world. 

The opposite side of the medal was exhibited in the House of Lords, where, 
10  at  all  events,  the  bodily  disposition  of  poor  little  Russell had nothing to  do 
with the motion of the Marquis of Clanricarde,  similar to that of Mr. Layard, 
and  likewise  announced  for  Friday,  after  it  had  already  several  times  been 
adjourned  on  the  request  of  Ministers. 

Lord  Brougham  rose,  with  the  assurance  that  he  had  not communicated 
15  with  any  member  of  the  Ministry,  but  that  he  found  the  motion  of  Lord 
Clanricarde,  announced  for  to-morrow,  most  inconvenient  in  the  present 
state of affairs. For this he would refer to the Secretary for Foreign Affairs. 

Lord  Clarendon  could  certainly  not  say  that  there would be  neither  mis 
chief nor inconvenience in a full discussion of the subject at present. Negoti-
20  ations  were  going on;  but  after  the  various  postponements,  he  felt that he 
ought  not  to  ask  again  his  noble  friend  to  withdraw  his  motion.  Yet  he 
reserved  to  himself,  in reply  to  him,  to  say nothing more than that which his 
sense  of  public  duty  allowed.  Nevertheless,  he  would  ask  his  noble  friend 
whether he would object to at least postponing the motion until Monday next, 
it being convenient to have this discussion in both Houses at the same time, 
and  Lord  J. Russell  being  extremely  unwell? 

25 

Earl  of  Ellenborough-The  noble  Marquis  opposite  would  only  exercise 
a  sound  discretion  if he deferred not only to  Monday, but generally, without 
fixing  at  present  any  day  for  the  motion  of  which  he  has  given  notice  for 

30  to-morrow. 

Lord  Derby—He  had  been  taken by surprise  on finding the  noble  Marquis 
bringing  the  question  under  consideration,  and  he  concurred  entirely  with 
the  views  of  the  noble  Earl,  (Ellenborough.) 

Earl  Grey—After  the  declaration  of  Lord  Clarendon  the  propriety  of 

35  postponing  discussion  must be  obvious  to  every  one. 

The  Marquis  of  Clanricarde  then  withdrew  his  motion. 
Earl  Fitzwilliam—ïie  would  ask whether  the  Russian  manifesto, the decla 

ration  of  a  holy  war against  Turkey,  dated  June  26,  was  authentic? 

Earl  Clarendon—Re  had  received  that  document  from  Her  Majesty's 

40  Minister at  St.  Petersburg. 

Earl  of  Malmesbury-It  was  due  to  the  dignity  of  their  Lordships  that they 

221 

Karl Marx 

should  be  assured  by  Government  of  its  intention  to  prevent,  as  far  as  it 
could,  a  similar  discussion taking  place  on  Monday  in  the  other  House. 

Earl  of  Aberdeen—He  and  his  colleagues  would  exercise  any  influence 

they  possessed  to  do  their  utmost  for  preventing  that  discussion. 

To  resume:  The  House  of  Commons  is  first  made  to  adjourn discussion 
by  a  fraud.  Then,  under  the  pretense  that  the  House  of  Commons  had 
adjourned discussion, the House  of Lords  is  made  to do the same. Then the 
"noble"  Lords  resolve  to  postpone  the  motion  ad  infinitum;  and  lastly,  the 
dignity  of  the  "noblest assembly on  the  face  of  the  earth"  requires  that the 
Commons  too  should postpone  the  motion  ad infinitum. 

5 

10 

On  an  interpellation  from  Mr.  Liddell,  Lord  Palmerston  declared  in  the 

same  sitting: 

15 

"The  recent  obstruction  of  the  navigation  of  the  Sulina-Canal  of  the 
Danube,  had  been  caused  by  the  accidental  circumstance  of  the  waters  of 
the river having overflowed and spread over the banks, and so far diminished 
the  force  of  the  current  as  to  increase the  quantity  of  mud  on the bar.  I  am 
bound  to  say  that,  for  many  years  past,  the  Government has  had  reason to 
complain  of  the  neglect  of  the  Government  of  Russia to  perform its  duties 
as  the  possessor  of  the  territory  of  which  the  Delta  of  the Danube  is  com 
posed,  and  to  maintain  the  Canal  of  the  Sulina in  efficient navigable  state,  20 
although  Russia  always  admitted  that  it was her duty to  do  so, by virtue  of 
the  treaty  of  Adrianople.  While  these  mouths  of  the  Danube  formed  parts 
of  the  Turkish territory,  there  was  maintained  a depth of  16 feet on the bar, 
whereas,  by  neglect  of  the  Russian  authorities  the  depth had  dinunished to 
11  feet,  and  even  these  11  feet were  reduced  to  a  small  and  narrow  canal  25 
from  obstructions  on the  sides,  from  sand-banks  and from vessels  wrecked 
and  sunk,  and  allowed  to  remain there,  so'that it was difficult for any vessel 
to  pass  except in calm  weather  and with  a  skillful pilot.  There was rivalship 
on  the  part  of  Odessa,  where  existed  a  desire  to  obstruct  the  export  of 
produce by  the  Danube,  and to  divert it,  if  possible  by  way  of Odessa." 

30 

Probably  the  English  Ministry  hope  that,  in  case  of  the  Principalities 
becoming  Russian,  the  mouths  of  the  Danube  will  reopen according as the 
rivalry  of  Odessa  will  be  shut. 

A  few  months  ago  I  took  occasion  to  remark  on the  progress  of  the  Ten 
Hours'  agitation  in the  Factory  districts.  The movement has been going on  35 
all  the  while,  and  has  at  last  found  an  echo  in  the  Legislature.  On  the  5th 
inst.,  Mr.  Cobbett,  M.P.  for  Oldham,  moved  for  leave  to  bring  in  a bill to 
restrict  factory  labor  to  ten  hours  on the  first five  days  of the  week,  and to 
seven  and  a  half  hours  on  Saturday.  Leave  was  given  to  bring  in  the  bill. 
During  the  preliminary  debate,  Lord  Palmerston,  in  the  warmth  of  im-  40 
provisation,  allowed  a distinct threat to  escape him, that,  if no  other  means 

222 

Layard's  Motion-Struggle  over  the  Ten  Hours'  Bill 

5 

for  protecting  the  factory  women  and  children  existed,  he  would  propose 
a restriction  of the  moving power.  The  sentence had  scarcely fallen from his 
lips,  when  a  general  storm  of  indignation burst forth against the  incautious 
statesman,  not  only  from  the  direct  representatives  of  miUocracy,  but par-
ticularly from their and his  own Whig friends,  such as Sir George Grey, Mr. 
Labouchere,  etc.  Lord J. Russell  having  taken  Palmerston  aside,  and  after 
half  an  hour's  private  pour-parler,  had  to  labor  very  hard  to  appease  the 
storm,  by  assuring  them  that  "it  appeared  to  him  that  his  honorable  friend 
had been entirely misunderstood,  and  that in expressing himself fora restric-
tion  of  the  moving  power,  his  friend  had  meant  to  express  himself  against 
it."  Such  absurd  compromises  are  the  daily  bread  of  the  Coalition.  At  all 
events  they have  the right to  say  one  thing  and to mean another.  As to Lord 
Palmerston  himself,  be  it  not  forgotten  that  that  old  dandy  of  Liberalism 
expelled  a  few  years  ago  some  hundred  Irish  families  from  his  "estates," 
15  much  in  the  same  way  as  the  Duchess  of  Sutherland  did with  the  ancient 

10 

clansmen. 

Mr.  Cobbett,  who  moved  the  bill,  is  the  son  of  the  renowned  William 
Cobbett,  and  represents  the  same  borough  his  father  did.  His  politics,  like 
his  seat,  are  the  inheritance  of his father, and therefore independent indeed, 
zo  but rather incoherent with the  state  of present parties. William Cobbett was 
the  most  able  representative,  or, rather,  the  creator of old  English Radical 
ism.  He  was  the  first  who  revealed  the  mystery  of  the  hereditary  party 
warfare  between  Tories  and  Whigs,  stripped  the  parasitic  Whig  Oligarchy 
of their  sham liberalism, opposed landlordism in its every form, ridiculed the 
25  hypocritical  rapacity  of  the  Established  Church,  and  attacked  the  money-
ocracy in its two most eminent incarnations—the "Old Lady of Threadneedle-
st."  (Bank  of  England)  and  Mr.  Muckworm & Co.  (the  national  creditors). 
He  proposed  to  cancel  the  national  debt,  to  confiscate  the Church estates, 
and  to  abolish  all  sorts  of  paper  money.  He  watched  step  for  step  the  en-
30  croachments  of  political  centralization  on  local  self-government,  and  de 
nounced  it  as  an  infringement  on  the  privileges  and  liberties  of  the  English 
subject.  He  did  not  understand  its  being  the  necessary  result  of  industrial 
centralization.  He proclaimed  all the political demands which have afterward 
been  combined  in  the  national  charter;  yet  with  him  they  were  rather  the 
35  political  charter  of  the  petty  industrial  middle-class  than  of  the  industrial 
proletarian.  A plebeian by instinct and by sympathy, his intellect rarely broke 
through the boundaries of middle-class reform. It was not until  1834,  shortly 
before his  death,  after the  establishment  of the  new Poor Law, that William 
Cobbett began to suspect the existence of a millocracy as hostile to the mass 
40  of the people,  as  landlords, banklords,  public creditors,  and the clergymen 
of  the  established  Church.  If  William  Cobbett  was  thus,  on  one  hand,  an 

223 

Karl Marx 

5 

anticipated  modem  Chartist,  he  was,  on the  other hand,  and  much more, an 
inveterate  John  Bull.  He  was  at  once  the  most  conservative  and  the  most 
destructive  man  of Great Britain—the purest incarnation of  Old England and 
the  most  audacious  initiator  of  Young  England.  He  dated  the  decline  of 
England from the  period of the  Reformation,  and the  ulterior prostration of 
the English people from the  so-called glorious Revolution of  1688. With him, 
therefore,  revolution  was  not  innovation,  but  restoration;  not the  creation 
of  a new  age,  but the rehabilitation of the  "good old times." What he did not 
see,  was  that  the  epoch  of  the  pretended  decline  of  the  English  people 
coincided  exactly  with  the  beginning ascendancy  of  the  middle  class, with  10 
the  development  of  modern  commerce  and  industry,  and  that,  at  the  same 
pace  as  the latter grew  up, the  material  situation of the people declined, and 
local  self-government  disappeared before  political centralization.  The  great 
changes  attending  the  decomposition  of  the  old  English  Society  since  the 
eighteenth  century  struck his  eyes  and  made  his heart bleed.  But if he  saw  15 
the effects, he did not understand the causes, the new social agencies at work. 
He  did  not  see  the  modern  bourgeoisie,  but only that fraction of the  aristoc 
racy  which  held  the  hereditary  monopoly  of  office,  and  which  sanctioned 
by law  all the  changes  necessitated by the new wants and pretensions of the 
middle-class.  He  saw  the machine, but not the hidden motive power.  In his  20 
eyes, therefore, the Whigs  were responsible for all the changes supervening 
since  1688.  They  were  the  prime  motors  of  the  decline  of  England and  the 
degradation  of  its  people.  Hence  his  fanatical  hatred  against,  and  his  ever 
recurring  denunciation of the Whig oligarchy.  Hence  the  curious phenome 
non, that William Cobbett, who represented by instinct the mass of the people  25 
against  the  encroachments  of  the  middle-class,  passed  in  the  eyes  of  the 
world  and  in  his  own  conviction  for  the  representative  of  the  industrial 
middle-class  against the  hereditary aristocracy.  As  a writer  he  has  not been 
surpassed. 

The  present Mr.  Cobbett,  by  continuing under altered circumstances the  30 

politics  of his  father,  has  necessarily  sunk into the class  of uberai Tories. 

The  Times,  anxious  to  make  good  for  its  humble  attitude  against  the 
Russian Czar by increased insolence against the English workingmen, brings 
a  leader  on  Mr.  Cobbett's  motion  that  aims  to  be  monstrous,  but  happens 
to  turn  out plainly absurd.  It cannot deny that the restriction of the  moving  35 
power  is  the  only  means  for  enforcing upon the  factory lords  a  submission 
to  the  existing  laws  with regard to  the  hours  of  factory labor.  But it fails  to 
understand  how any man of common sense who aims  at attaining an end can 
propose  the  only  adequate  means  to  it. The existing  ten-and-a-half-hours act, 
like  all  other  factory  laws,  is  but a fictitious  concession made by the ruling  40 
classes  to  the  working-people;  and  the  working-men,  not  satisfied with the 

224 

Layard's  Motion—Struggle  over the  Ten  Hours'  Bill 

5 

mere  appearance  of  a concession, dare insist upon its reality.  The  Times has 
never  heard  of  a  thing  more  ridiculous  or  more  extravagant.  If  a  master 
should  be  prevented  by  Parliament  from  working  his  hands  during  12,  16, 
or  any  other  number  of  hours,  then,  says  The  Times,  "England is  no  longer 
a  place  for  a  freeman  to  live  in."  Thus  the  South  Carolina  gentleman who 
was  placed  before  and  condemned  by  a  London  Magistrate  for  having 
publicly  whipped  the  negro  he had brought with him from  the  other  side  of 
the  Atlantic,  exclaimed in  a most exasperated  state of mind,  "You don't call 
this  a  free  country  where  a  man  is forbidden to whip  his  own nigger?"  If  a 
10  man becomes a factory hand, and enters into contract with a master, in virtue 
of  which he  sells  himself  for  sixteen or  eighteen hours, instead of taking his 
sleep  as  better-circumstanced  mortals can do, you have to explain that,  says 
The  Times,  "by  that  natural  impulse  which  perpetually  adjusts  the  supply 
to  the  demand,  and  directs  people to  the occupation most agreeable and most 
suited  to  themselves." Legislation,  of  course,  must  not  interfere  with  this 
travail attrayant.  If you  restrict the  moving power  of  machinery to  a  definite 
portion of  the  day,  say from  6  o'clock,  a.m.  to 6 p.m., then,  says  The  Times, 
you  might  as  well  suppress  machinery  altogether.  If  you  stop  the  gas-light 
in  the  public  thoroughfares  as  soon  as  the  sun  rises,  you  must  stop  it  also 
20  during  the  night.  The  Times  forbids  legislative  interference  with  private 

15 

concerns, and therefore, perhaps, it defends the duty on paper, on advertise 
ments,  and the newspaper-stamp, in order to keep down the private concerns 
of  its  competitors,  asking  the  Legislature  to  relieve  its  own concern of the 
supplement  duty.  It  professes  an  utter  abhorrence  of  parliamentary  inter-
25 f erence with the sacred interest of mill-lords, where the lives and the morals 
of  whole  generations  are  at stake,  while it has  croaked its  most determined 
interference with cabmen and hackneycoach proprietors, where nothing was 
at  stake  except  the  conveniences  of  some  fat  city-men,  and  perhaps  the 
gentlemen  of  Printing-house-square.  Till  now  the  middle-class  economists 
30  have  told  us  that  the  principal  use  of  machinery  was  its  shortening  and 
superseding  bodily  labor  and  drudgery.  Now  The  Times  confesses  that, 
under  present  class-arrangements  machinery  does  not  shorten  but prolong 
the  hours  of  labor—that it firstly bereaves  the  individual  labor  of its quality, 
and then forces the laborer to make up for the loss in quality by quantity—thus 
adding hour to  hour, night labor to day labor,  in a process which only stops 
at  the  intervals  of  industrial  crises,  when  the  man  is  refused  any  labor  at 
all—when the factory is  shut before his nose, and when he may enjoy holidays 
or  hang  himself  if  he  pleases.

The  Russo-Turkish  Difficulty-
Ducking and Dodging of the  British Cabinet— 
Nesselröden  Last Note— 
The East-India Question. 

Correspondence  of  The  N.Y.Tribune. 

London,  Tuesday,  July  12,1853. 

The  Parliamentary  farce  of  Thursday  last  was  continued  and  brought  to  a 
close in the  sitting of Friday, 8th inst. Lord Palmerston requested Mr. Layard 
not  only  to  put  off  his  motion  to  Monday,  but  never  to  make  any  mention 
of it again.  "Monday was  now to go the way of Friday."  Mr.  Bright took the 
opportunity  of  congratulating  Lord  Aberdeen  on  his  cautious  policy,  and 
generally  to  assure  him  of  his  entire  confidence. 

"Were  the  Peace  Society  itself  the  Cabinet,"  says  The  Morning  Advertiser, 
"it  could  not  have  done  more  to  encourage  Russia,  to  discourage  France, 
to  endanger  Turkey,  and  discredit  England,  than  the  very  good  Aberdeen. 
Mr.  Bright's  speech  was  meant  as  a  sort  of  Manchester  manifesto  in favor 
of  the  tremblers  of  the  Cabinet." 

The  Ministerial  efforts  for  burking  the  intended  question  of  Mr.  Layard 
originated in  a well-founded  fear that the internal dissensions in the  Cabinet 
could  have  no  longer  been  kept  a  secret  to  the  public.  Turkey  must fall  to 
pieces,  that  the  Coalition  may  keep  together.  Next  to  Lord  Aberdeen,  the 
Ministers most favorable to the tricks of Russia, are the following: The Duke 
of  Argyll,  Lord  Clarendon,  Lord  Granville,  Mr.  Sidney Herbert,  Mr.  Card-
well,  and  the  "Radical"  Sir  William  Molesworth.  Lord  Aberdeen is  said to 
have threatened at one time to offer his resignation. The "vigorous" Palmer-

ston  (civis  Romanus  sum)  party,  of  course, was  but wanting  such a pretext 
for  yielding.  They  resolved  that  a  common  representation  should  be  ad 
dressed  to  the  Courts  of  St.  Petersburg and Constantinople, recommending 
that  the  "privileges  demanded  by  the  Czar for the  Greek Christians  should 
5  be secured to Christians of all denominations in the Turkish dominions, under 
a  treaty  of  guaranty,  to  which  the  great  powers  should  be  parties."  This 
identical  proposition was,  however,  already  made  to  Prince Menchikoff, on 
the eve of his  departure from Constantinople,  and was  made,  as  everybody 
knows, to  no purpose.  It is, therefore, utterly ridiculous to expect any result 
from its  repetition,  the  more  so, as it is now a matter beyond all doubt that 
what  Russia  insists  upon having  is  exactly  a treaty which the  great powers, 
viz:  Austria  and  Prussia,  now  no  longer  resist.  Count  Buoi,  the  Austrian 
Premier,  is brother-in-law to  Count Peter Meyendorff, the Russian Minister, 
and  acts  in  perfect  agreement  with  Russia.  On  the  same  day  on which the 
two  Coalition parties, the slumbering and the "vigorous," came to the above 
resolution,  the  Patrie  published  the  following: 

10 

15 

"The  new  Internuncio  of  Austria,  at  Constantinople,  M.  de  Bruck, com 
menced  by calling upon the  Porte  to  pay  5,000,000 piasters as an indemnity, 
and  to  consent  to  the  delivery  of  the  ports  of  Kleck  and  Sutorina.  This 

20  demand  was  considered  as  a  support given to  Russia." 

This  is  not the  only  support  given by  Austria  to  the  Russian  interests  at 
Constantinople.  In  1848,  it  will  be  remembered,  that  whenever  the Princes 
wanted to  shoot their people, they provided a "misunderstanding." The same 
stratagem  is  now  being  employed  against  Turkey.  The  Austrian  Consul  at 
25  Smyrna causes the kidnapping of a Hungarian from an English coffee house 
on  board  an  Austrian  vessel,  and  after  the  refugees  have  answered  this 
attempt by the  killing of  an Austrian officer  and  the wounding  another one, 
M.  de  Bruck demands  satisfaction from the  Porte  within 24 hours.  Simulta 
neously  with  this  news,  The  Morning Post oí  Saturday  reports  a  rumor  that 
the  Austrians  had  entered  Bosnia.  The  Coalition,  questioned  as to  the  au 
thenticity of  this  rumor,  in yesterday's  sitting of both Houses of Parliament, 
had,  of  course,  received  "no  information;"  Russell  alone  venturing  the 
suggestion  that  the  rumor  had  probably  no  other  foundation  than  the  fact 
that  the  Austrians  collected  troops  at  Peterwardein.  Thus  is  fulfilled  the 
35 prediction of M. de Tatistchef f, in 1828, that Austria, when things were come 
to  a  decisive  turn,  would  eagerly  make  ready  for  sharing  in  the  spoil. 

30 

A  dispatch from  Constantinople,  dated  26th ult.,  states: 
"The  Sultan,  in  consequence  of  the  rumors  that  the  whole  Russian  fleet 
has  left  Sebastopol  and  is  directing  its  course  toward  the  Bosphorus,  has 
inquired  of  the  Ambassadors  of  England  and  France whether, in the  event 
of the Russians making a demonstration before the Bosphorus, the combined 

40 

227 

Karl Marx 

fleets  are  ready  to  pass  the  Dardanelles.  Both answered in the  affirmative. 
A Turkish  steamer,  with French and English officers  on board, has just been 
sent  from  the  Bosphorus  to  the  Black  Sea,  in  order  to  reconnoitre." 

5 

The first thing the Russians did after their entry into the PrincipaUties, was 
to  prohibit  the  publication  of  the  Sultan's  firman  confirming  the  privileges 
of  all kinds  of Christians,  and to  suppress  a German paper  edited  at Bucha 
rest,  which  had  dared  to  publish  an  article  on  the  Eastern question.  At the 
same  time,  they  pressed  from  the  Turkish  Government  the  first  annuity 
stipulated  for  their  former  occupation  of  Moldavia  and  Wallachia,  in 
1848—49.  Since  1828  the  Protectorate  of  Russia has  cost the Principalities  10 
150,000,000  piastres,  beside  the  immense losses  caused through pillage  and 
devastation.  England defrayed the expenses of Russia's wars against France, 
France  that  of  her  war  against Persia, Persia that of her war against Turkey, 
Turkey and England that of her war against Poland;  Hungary and the Princi 
palities have  now to  pay her war  against Turkey. 

15 

The  most  important  event  of  the  day  is  the  new  circular  note  of  Count 
Nesselrode dated St. Petersburg, 20th June, 1853. It declares that the Russian 
armies will  not evacuate the PrincipaUties until the Sultan shall have yielded 
to  all the  demands  of the Czar,  and the  French and English fleets shall have 
left  the  Turkish  waters.  The  note  in  question  reads  like  a  direct  scorn  of  20 
England  and  France.  Thus  it  says: 

"The  position taken by the two maritime Powers is  a maritime occupation 
which  gives  us  a  reason for  reëstabUshing the  equilibrium  of the  reciprocal 
situations  by  taking  up  a  military  position." 

Be  it  remarked,  that  Besika  Bay  is  at  a  distance  of  150 miles  from  Con-  25 

stantinople.  The  Czar  claims  for  himself  the  right  of  occupying  Turkish 
territory,  while  he  defies  England  and  France  to  occupy  neutral  waters 
without his  special permission.  He  extols his own magnanimous forbearance 
in  having left  the  Porte  complete  mistress  of  choosing under what form  She 
will  abdicate  her  sovereignty—whether  "convention,  sened,  or  other  syn-  30 
allagmatic  act,  or  even  under  the  form  of  signing  a  simple  note."  He  is 
persuaded  that  "impartial  Europe"  must  understand  that  the  treaty  of 
Kainardji,  which  gives  Russia  the  right  of protecting  a  single  Greek  chapel 
at  Stamboul,  proclaims  her  eo ipso the  Rome  of the  Orient.  He  regrets  that 
the  West  is  ignorant  of  the  inoffensive  character  of  a  Russian  religious 
protectorate  in  foreign  countries.  He  proves  his  solicitude for the integrity 
of  the  Turkish  Empire  by historical facts—"the  very  moderate  use  he  made 
in  1829 of his victory of Adrianople," when he was only prevented from being 
immoderate  by  the  miserable  condition of his  army, and by the threat of the 
English  admiral,  that,  authorized  or  not  authorized,  he  would  bombard  every  40 
coast-place  along  the  Black  Sea;  when  all he  obtained was  due to  the  "for-

bearance"  of  the  Western  Cabinets,  and  the  perfidious  destruction  of  the 
Turkish fleet at Navarino.  "In  1833,  he  alone  in Europe  saved Turkey from 
inevitable dismemberment." In 1833 the Czar concluded, through the famous 
treaty  of  Unkiar-Skelessi,  a  defensiveaffiancewithTurkey,by  whichforeign 
fleets  were  forbidden  to  approach  Constantinople,  by  which  Turkey  was 
saved  only from  dismemberment,  in  order to be  saved entire for Russia.  "In 
1839  he  took the initiative  with the  other Powers  in the propositions  which, 
executed in common, prevented the  Sultan from  seeing his  throne give place 
to  a new Arabian Empire."  That is to  say, in 1839 he made the other Powers 
1 o take the initiative in the destruction of the Egyptian fleet, and in the reduction 
to impotence  of the  only  man who  might have converted Turkey into a vital 
danger  to  Russia,  and  to  replace  a  "dressed up turban" by a real head.  "The 
fundamental  principle  of  the  policy  of  our  august  master  has  always  been 
to  maintain,  as  long  as  possible,  the  status  quo of the  East." Just so.  He has 
carefully  preserved  the  decomposition  of  the  Turkish  State,  under the  ex 
clusive  guardianship  of  Russia. 

15 

It must be granted that a more ironical document the East has never dared 
to  throw  in  the  face  of  the  West.  But  its  author  is  Nesselrode—a  nettle,  at 
once,  and  a rod.  It is a document, indeed, of Europe's degradation under the 
rod of counter-revolution.  Revolutionists may congratulate the Czar on this 
masterpiece.  If Europe withdraws,  she withdraws  not with a  simple  defeat, 
but  passes,  as  it  were,  under  furcae  caudinae.

While  the  English Queen is,  at this  moment,  feasting Russian Princesses; 
while  an enlightened English aristocracy  and bourgeoisie lie prostrate before 
the  barbarian  autocrat,  the  English  proletariat  alone  protests  against  the 
impotency  and  degradation  of  the  ruling  classes.  On  the  7th July the  Man 
chester  School  held  a  great  Peace  meeting  in  the  Odd-Fellows  Hall,  at 
Halifax.  Crossley,  M.P.  for  Halifax,  and  all  the  other  "great  men"  of  the 
School  had  especially  flocked  to  the  meeting  from  "town."  The  hall  was 
30  crowded,  and  many  thousands  could  obtain  no  admittance.  Ernest Jones, 
(whose agitation in the factory districts is gloriously progressing, as you may 
infer from the  number  of Charter petitions presented to Parliament, and from 
the attacks of the middle-class provincial press,) was, at the time, at Durham. 
The  Chartists  of  Halifax,  the  place  where  he  has  twice been  nominated and 
35  declared  by  show  of  hands  as  a  candidate  for  the  House  of  Commons, 
summoned  him  by  electric  telegraph,  and  he  appeared  just  in  time  for  the 
meeting.  Already  the  gentlemen  of  the  Manchester  School  believed  they 
would  carry  their  resolution,  and  would  be  able  to  bring  home the  support 
of  the  manufacturing  districts  to  their  good  Aberdeen,  when  Ernest  Jones 
rose  and put  an amendment pledging  the  people  to  war,  and declaring that 
before  liberty  was  established  peace  was  a  crime.  There  ensued  a  most 

40 

229 

Karl Marx 

violent  discussion,  but  the  amendment  of  Ernest  Jones  was  carried  by  an 
immense  majority. 

5 

The  clauses  of  the  India  Bill  are passing one by one, the debate  scarcely 
offering  any  remarkable features,  except the inconsistency  of the  so-called 
India  Reformers.  There  is,  for  instance,  my  Lord  Jocelyn,  M.P.,  who  has 
made  a  kind  of  political  livelihood by  bis  periodical  denunciation of Indian 
wrongs,  and  of  the  mal-administration of the  East  India Company. What do 
you  think  his  amendment  amounted  to?  To give the  East India Company  a 
lease  for  10  years.  Happily,  it  compromised  no  one  but  himself.  There  is 
another  professional  "Reformer,"  Mr.  Jos.  Hume,  who,  during  his  long  10 
parliamentary  life,  has  succeeded  in  transforming  opposition  itself  into  a 
particular  manner  of supporting the  ministry.  He proposed not to reduce the 
number  of  East  India  Directors  from  24  to  18.  The  only  amendment  of 
common  sense,  yet  agreed to,  was  that  of  Mr.  Bright,  exempting Directors 
nominated  by  the  Government  from  the  qualification  in  East  India  Stock,  15 
imposed  by  the  Directors  elected  by  the  Court  of  Proprietors.  Go  through 
the  pamphlets  published  by  the  East  Indian  Reform  Association,  and  you 
will  feel  a  similar  sensation  as  when,  hearing of  one  great act of  accusation 
against Bonaparte,  devised in common by Legitimists, Orleanists, Blue  and 
Red Republicans, and even disappointed Bonapartists. Their only merit until 20 
now has been to draw public attention to Indian affairs in general, and further 
they  cannot  go  in  their  present  form  of  eclectic  opposition.  For  instance, 
while  they  attack the  doings  of the English aristocracy in India, they protest 
against  the  destruction  of  the  Indian  aristocracy  of  native  princes. 

After  the  British  intruders  had once  put their feet on India,  and made up  25 

their  mind  to  hold  it,  there  remained  no  alternative  but to break the power 
of  the  native  princes  by  force  or by intrigue.  Placed with regard to  them in 
similar  circumstances  as  the ancient Romans with regard to their allies, they 
followed  in  the  track  of  Roman  politics.  "It was,"  says  an  English writer, 
"a system of fattening allies, as we fatten oxen, till they were worthy of being  30 
devoured."  After  having  won  over  their  allies  in the  way of  ancient Rome, 
the  East-India  Company  executed  them  in the  modern  manner  of  Change-
Alley.  In  order  to  discharge  the  engagements  they  had  entered into with the 
Company,  the  native  princes  were  forced  to  borrow  enormous  sums  from 
Englishmen at usurious interest. When their embarrassment had reached the  35 
highest  pitch,  the  creditor  got  inexorable,  "the  screw  was  turned"  and  the 
princes  were  compelled  either  to  concede  their  territories  amicably  to  the 
Company,  or  to  begin  war;  to  become  pensioners  on  their  usurpers  in  one 
case,  or  to  be  deposed  as  traitors  in  the  other.  At  this  moment  the  native 
States occupy an area of 690,261 square miles, with a population of 52,941,263 40 
souls,  being,  however,  no  longer  the  allies,  but  only  the  dependents  of  the 

230 

The  Russo-Turk'ish  Difficulty—Nesselrode's  Last  Note—The  East-India  Question 

British  Government,  upon  multifarious  conditions,  and  under  the  various 
forms  of  the  subsidiary and of the protective  systems.  These  systems have 
in  common  the  relinquishment,  by  the  native  States  of  the  right  of  self-
defense,  of  maintaining  diplomatic  relations,  and  of  settling  the  disputes 
among themselves  without the interference  of the Governor-General. All of 
them  have  to  pay  a  tribute,  either  in hard  cash,  or  in a contingent of  armed 
forces,  commanded  by  British  officers.  The  final  absorption or annexation 
of  these  native  States  is  at  present  eagerly  controverted  between  the  re 
formers  who  denounce  it  as  a  crime,  and  the  men  of  business  who  excuse 
it as  a necessity.

10 

15 

In  my  opinion  the  question  itself  is  altogether  improperly  put.  As  to  the 
native  States  they  virtually  ceased  to  exist  from  the  moment  they  became 
subsidiary  to  or  protected  by  the  Company.  If  you  divide the  revenue  of  a 
country between two governments, you are  sure to cripple the resources of 
the one  and the  administration of both. Under the present system the native 
States  succumb under the double incubus of their native Administration and 
the  tributes  and  inordinate  military  establishments  imposed  upon  them  by 
the  Company.  The  conditions  under  which  they  are  allowed to retain their 
apparent  independence  are  at  the  same  time  the  conditions  of  a permanent 
20  decay,  and  of  an  utter  inability  of  improvement.  Organic  weakness  is  the 
constitutional law  of  their  existence,  as  of  all  existences  living upon  suffer 
ance.  It is, therefore,  not the native  States,  but the native  Princes and Courts 
about whose maintenance the question revolves. Now, is it not a strange thing 
that  the  same  men  who  denounce  "the  barbarous  splendors  of  the  Crown 
25  and  Aristocracy  of  England"  are  shedding tears  at the  downfall  of  Indian 
Nabobs,  Rajahs,  and  Jagheerdars,  the  great  majority  of  whom possess  not 
even the prestige  òf  antiquity,  being generally usurpers  of  very recent date, 
set up by English intrigue ! There exists in the whole world no despotism more 
ridiculous,  absurd  and  childish  than  that  of  those  Schazenans and  Schariars 
30  of  the  Arabian Nights.  The  Duke  of  Wellington,  Sir J. Malcolm,  Sir Henry 
Russell,  Lord  Ellenborough,  General  Briggs,  and  other  authorities,  have 
pronounced  in  favor  of  the  status  quo;  but  on  what  grounds?  Because  the 
native  troops under  English rule want employment in the petty warfares with 
their  own countrymen,  in  order  to  prevent  them from  turning their  strength 
35  against their own European masters. Because the existence of independent 
States  gives  occasional  employment  to  the  English  troops.  Because  the 
hereditary princes  are the most servile tools of English despotism, and check 
the  rise  of  those  bold  military  adventurers  with  whom  India  has  and  ever 
will abound.  Because the independent territories afford a refuge to all discon-
tented  and  enterprising  native  spirits.  Leaving  aside  all  these  arguments, 
which  state  in  so  many words  that the native princes  are the  strongholds of 

40 

231

the present  abominable  English  system  and the  greatest obstacles  to  Indian 
progress,  I  come  to  Sir Thomas  Munro  and  Lord  Elphinstone, who were  at 
least  men  of  superior  genius,  and  of  real  sympathy  for  the  Indian  people. 
They  think  that  without  a  native  aristocracy  there  can be  no  energy in any 
other class of the community, and that the  subversion of that aristocracy will 
not raise but debase a whole people. They may be right as long as the natives, 
under  direct  English  rule  are  systematically  excluded  from  all  superior 
offices,  military  and  civil.  Where  there  can be  no  great  men  by  their  own 
exertion,  there  must  be  great  men  by  birth,  to leave to  a conquered people 
some greatness  of their own.  That exclusion, however, of the native people  10 
from  the  English territory, has been effected only by the maintenance  of the 
hereditary  princes  in  the  so-called  independent territories. And one of these 
two  concessions  had  to  be  made  to  the  native  army,  on  whose  strength  all 
British  rule  in  India  depends.  I  think  we  may  trust  the  assertion  of  Mr. 
Campbell that the native Indian Aristocracy are the least enabled to fill higher 
offices ;  that for  all fresh requirements it is  necessary to  create a fresh class ; 
and that "from the  acuteness and aptness to learn of the inferior classes, this 
can  be  done  in  India  as  it  can  be  done  in  no  other  country." 

15 

The  native  princes  themselves  are  fast  disappearing  by the  extinction of 
their  houses;  but,  since  the  commencement  of  this  century,  the  British  20 
Government  has  observed  the  policy  of  allowing  them  to  make  heirs  by 
adoption,  or  of filling up their vacant seats  with puppets  of English creation. 
The great Governor-General, Lord Dalhousie, was the first to protest openly 
against this  system.  Were not the natural course of things artificially resisted, 
there would be wanted neither wars nor expenses to do away with the native  25 
princes. 

As to the pensioned princes, the £2,468,969 assigned to them by the British 
Government  on  the  Indian  revenue  is  a  most  heavy  charge  upon  a  people 
living on  rice,  and  deprived  of the  first necessaries  of life.  If  they are  good 
for  any  thing,  it is  for  exhibiting  Royalty  in  its  lowest  stage  of degradation  30 
and ridicule.  Take, for instance,  the Great Mogul, the descendant of Timour 
Tamerlane:  He  is  allowed  £120,000  a  year.  His  authority  does  not  extend 
beyond  the  walls  of his palace, withing which the  Royal idiotic race, left to 
itself,  propagates  as  freely  as  rabbits.  Even  the  police  of  Delhi  is  held  by 
Englishmen  above  bis control. There  he  sits on his throne, a little  shriveled  35 
yellow  old  man trimmed in  a theatrical  dress,  embroidered with gold,  much 
like  that  of  the  dancing girls  of  Hindostán.  On  certain  State  occasions, the 
tinsel-covered puppet  issues  forth to  gladden the  hearts  of  the  loyal.  On his 
days  of  reception  strangers  have  to  pay  a fee,  in the  form of guineas,  as  to 
any  other  saltimbanque  exhibiting  himself  in  public;  while  he,  in his  turn,  40 
presents  them with turbans,  diamonds, etc.  On looking nearer  at them, they 

232 

The  Russo-Turkish  Difficulty—Nesselröden  Last  Note—The  East-India  Question 

find  that  the  Royal  diamonds  are,  like  so  many  pieces  of  ordinary  glass, 
grossly painted  and  imitating as roughly as possible the precious  stones, and 
jointed  so  wretchedly,  that  they  break in the  hand  like  gingerbread. 

The  English  money-lenders,  combined  with  the  English  Aristocracy, 
understand,  we  must  own,  the  art  of  degrading  Royalty,  reducing  it  to  the 
nullity of  constitutionalism  at home, and to the  skeleton of etiquette  abroad. 
And  now,  here  are  the  Radicals,  exasperated  at  this  spectacle!

War in Burmah—The Russian Question-
Curious  Diplomatic  Correspondence. 

Correspondence  of  The  N.Y.Tribune 

London,  Friday,  July  15,1853. 

By  the  latest  overland  mail  from  India,  intelligence  has  been  received that 
the  Burmese  ambassadors  have  rejected  the  treaty  proposed  by  General 
Godwin.  The  General  afforded  them  24  hours  more  for  reflection,  but  the 
Burmese  departed  within  10  hours.  A  third  edition  of  the  interminable 
Burmese  war  appears  to  be  inevitable. 

5 

Of  all  the  warlike  expeditions  of  the  British  in the  East,  none  have ever  10 

been  undertaken  on  less  warranted  grounds  than  those  against  Burmah. 
There  was  no  possible  danger  of  invasion from  that  side,  as  there was from 
the  North-West,  Bengal being  separated from  Burmah by  a range  of  moun 
tains,  across  which  troops  cannot  be  marched.  To  go  to  war  with  Burmah 
the  Indian  Government  is  obliged  to  go  to  sea.  To  speak  of  maritime  ag-  15 
gressions  on  the  part  of  the  Burmese  is  as  ridiculous,  as  the  idea  of  their 
coast-junks  fronting  the  Company's  war  steamers  would  be  preposterous. 
The  pretension that the Yankees had strong annexation propensities applied 
to  Pegu,  is  borne  out  by no facts.  No  argument, therefore,  remains behind, 
but the want of  employment for a needy  aristocracy, the necessity of creat-  20 
ing,  as  an  English  writer  says,  "a  regular  quality-workhouse,  or  Hampton 
Court in the  East."  The  first Burmese war, (1824—26) entered into under the 
Quixotic  administration of  Lord  Amherst,  although it lasted little more than 
two  years,  added  thirteen  millions  to  the  Indian  debt.  The  maintenance  of 
the Eastern settlements  at Singapore, Penang and Malacca, exclusive of the  25 
pay  of  troops,  causes  an annual excess of expenditure over income  amount 
ing to £100,000. The territoriy taken from the Burmese in  1826 costs as much 

234 

War in  Burma—The  Russian  Question-Curious  Diplomatie Correspondence 

5 

10 

15 

more. The territory of Pegu is  still more ruinous. Now, why is it that England 
shrinks from the  most necessary war in Europe, as now against Russia, while 
she tumbles, year after year, into the most reckless wars in Asia? The national 
debt has  made her  a trembler in  Europe—the charges of the Asiatic wars are 
thrown  on  the  shoulders  of the  Hindoos.  But we may expect from  the now 
impending  extinction  of  the  Opium  revenue  of  Bengal,  combined  with  the 
expenses  of  another  Burmese war, that they will produce such a crisis in the 
Indian exchequer,  as will cause a more thorough reform of the Indian Empire 
than  all  the  speeches  and  tracts  of  the  Parliamentary  Reformers  in  Eng-
land. 

Yesterday,  in  the  House  of  Commons,  Mr.  Disraeli  asked  Ministers, 
whether,  after  the  latest  circular  note  of  the  Russian  Cabinet,  Mr.  Layard 
might  not  very  properly  bring  in  his  motion.  Lord  John Russell  answered, 
that  it  appeared  to  him  by  far  the  best  not  to  hear  Mr.  Layard  at  present,. 
as,  since  the  publication  of  that  note,  it  was  more  important than  ever  to 
negotiate.  "The notion of the honorable member, that negotiations had come 
now  to  a  dead  lock,  was  an  erroneous  notion."  Lord  John,  while  actually 
confessing  his  Aberdeen  credo,  attempted to  re-vindicate  the  dignity  of  the 
civis-Romanus-sum  party  in  the  following  words: 

20  "I  naturally  supposed  that  a  person  of  the  experience  and  sagacity  of  Count 
Nesselrode,  would  not  have  affixed  his  signature  to  a  document  declaring 
to  all  the  world  that  the  Russian  Government  made  the  removal  of  the 
combined  fleets  the  condition  of  its  evacuation  of  the  Principalities." 

25 

In  the  subsequent  Indian  debate  Mr.  Bright  moved,  that  from  the  ninth 
clause  which  provides,  "that  six of the directors not elected by the  Crown, 
shall be persons who have been ten years in India in the service of the Crown 
or the Company." The words,  "in the service of the Crown or the Company," 
should  be  expunged.  The  amendment  was  agreed  to.  It  is  significant,  that 
during the whole Indian debate no amendments are agreed to by the Ministry, 
30  and  consequently  carried  by  the  House,  except  those  of  Mr.  Bright.  The 
peace  Ministry,  at this  moment  does  everything to  secure its  entente cordiale 
with the  Peace  party,  Manchester  school,  who  are  opposed  to  any  kind  of 
warfare,  except  by  cotton  bales  and  price  currents. 

35 

M.  Drouin de L'Huys, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, once upper 
clerk  at  the  Foreign  Office  under  M.  Guizot,  and  declared  by  his  chef,  to 
possess  hardly  the  necessary  qualifications  for  that place,  is  now  indulging 
freely in the  pleasure  of  exchanging notes  and circulars  with Count Nessel 
rode.  The  Moniteur of  yesterday  brings  his  reply  to  the  last  (2d)  circulate 
of  the  Russian  Minister,  which  concludes  in  the  following  terms: 

40 

"The moderation of France takes from her all responsibility* and gives her 
the  right  to  hope  that  all  the  sacrifices  which  she  has  made  to  secure  the 

235 

Karl Marx 

tranquillity of  the  East will  not have  been in vain;  that the Russian Govern 
ment  will  at  length  discover  some  mode  of  reconciling its  pretensions  with 
the  prerogatives  of  the  Sultan's  sovereignty;  and  that  an  arrangement  be 
devised that shall  settle, without a resort to force, a question, on the  solution 
of which,  so  many interests  are  dependant." 

I mentioned in a former letter the propositions once made by M.  de Villèle 
to  Russia,  for  the  maintenance  of  the  integrity  of  the  Ottoman  Empire, by 
a treaty of guarantee between all the Great Powers, propositions which called 
forth  this  reply  from  Count  Pozzo  di  Borgo: 

5 

"That  a  general  guarantee  of  the  Ottoman Empire,  independently of  its 
being unusual and  surprising,  would wound the rights acquired by Russia and 
the  principles  upon  which  they  are  founded." 

10 

Well,  in  1841,  Russia  nevertheless  agreed  to  become  party  to  such  an 
unusual  treaty,  and  Nesselrode  himself,  in  his  note  of  20th  June  (2d  July) 
refers  to  that  treaty.  Why  did  Russia  assent  to  it,  in  contradiction  to  its  15 
traditional  policy?  Because  that  treaty  was  not  one  of  "guarantee  of  the 
Ottoman Empire,"  but rather of execution against its then only vital element, 
Egypt, under  Mehemet Ah—because it was a coalition against France, at least 
in  its  original  intention. 

The  Paris  journal  La  Presse gives  in  its  number of today, which has  just  20 

come  to  my  hands,  a  correspondence  never  before  published  between  the 
late  General  Sebastiani,  Ambassador  in London,  and  Mme.  Adelaide, sister 
of Louis Philippe,  a correspondence which reflects a remarkable light on the 
diplomatic transactions  of that epoch.  It contains clear proofs that the Treaty 
of  1841,  far  from having  been  originated  by  Russia,  as  Nessehode  affirms  25 
in  his  note, was, on the  contrary,  originated by France  and  England  against 
Russia,  and  was  only  afterward  turned  by  Russia  into  a  weapon  against 
France.  I  translate  from  this  important  correspondence  as  much  as  the 
pressure  of  time  permits  me  to  do: 

I.) 

London, April 21,  1836.  30 

In  this  country  all  parties  are  unanimous  as  to  the  necessity  of  closely 
watching Russia,  and I believe  that the  Tory party is  more  decided than the 
Whigs,  or  at  least  it  seems  so,  because  it  is  not  moderated  by  office. 

II.) 

London, June  12,  1838. 

I have had to-day  a conference  of two  hours'  duration with Lord Palmer-  35 

ston.  I  have  been  highly  satisfied  with  him.  I  was  not mistaken in assuring 
you  that  he  was  a friend of  King Leopold,  and  above  all a great partisan of 
the  French  alliance.  Lord  Palmerston  has  conversed  a  great  deal  with  me 
on  Oriental  affairs.  He  thinks  that  the  Pasha  of  Egypt  is  decided  as  to  his 

236 

F

5 

course  of  action.  He  wishes  that  England  and  France  should  make  fresh 
efforts,  supported  by  the  presence  of  their  fleets,  in  order  to  intimidate 
Mehemet,  and  that  simultaneously  our  Ambassadors  at  Constantinople 
should  inform  the  Sultan  that  they  have  received  orders  from their  Courts 
to  assure  him  of  their  support  against  the  attempts  of  the  Pasha  of  Egypt, 
under the condition that he would not take the initiative in hostilities. I believe 
this  to  be  a  prudent  course,  and  advisable  to  be  followed  by  England  and 
France.  We  must  maintain the  Porte  and  not  suffer the  Provinces  of Egypt, 
Syria  and  Celesyria  to  become  detached  from  it.  Russia  only  awaits  the 
10  moment  for  marching  up  her  succours  to  the  Sultan,  and  that  assistance 

would  be  the  end  of  the  Ottoman  Empte.

London,  My  6,  1838. 
People  in  this  country  believe  in  the general understanding of Europe  as 
to  the  Oriental  question.  The  answer  from  Paris  is  impatiently  looked  for. 
I  think  not  to  have  surpassed  the  line  of  conduct traced to  me by the  King 
in  several  conversations.  As  soon  as  the  entente  shall  be  established  in 
principle,  the  manner  of  action  and  the  position  to  be  taken  up  by  each  of 
the  Powers,  will  be  regulated  according  to  contingencies.  The  part Russia 
has  to  play  must,  of  course,  be  maritime,  like  that  of  France  and England, 
20  and  in  order  to  prevent  any  danger  that might result from the  action of  the 
fleet  in  the  Black  Sea,  she  must  be  brought  to  the  understanding  that  her 
squadron  in  the  combined  fleet  is  to  be  drawn  from  the  Baltic.

London,  October  3,  1839. 
England has  not  accepted the  Russian propositions, and Lord Palmerston 
informed me,  on the part of the  Government,  that  she  had refused,  in order 
to  remain  true  to  the  French  Alliance.  Induced  by  the  same  feeling  she 
consents  that Mehemet AM shall receive the hereditary possession of Egypt, 
and of that portion of Syria within a boundary to be demarked, which should 
go  from  St.  Jean  d'Acre  to  the  lake  of  Tabarie.  We  have,  not  without  dif-
ficulty, obtained the assent of the English Government to these latter propo 
sitions.  I  do  not think that  such  an  arrangement would be  rejected by either 
France  or  Mehemet  Ali.  The  Oriental  question  simplifies  itself;  it  will  be 
terminated  by the  concurrence  of the Powers, and under the guaranty of the 
integrity  of  the  Ottoman  Empire.  All  the  principles  are  maintained.  The 
35  Sublime  Porte  is  admitted  to  the  law  of  nations  of  Europe.  The  exclusive 
protectorate  of  Russia  is  annihilated.  I  have  asked  myself  why  the  Re 
publican  faction  in  France  showed  itself  so  favoAble  to  Mehemet Ali,  and 
why  it  has  so  warmly  espoused  his  cause.  I  have  not  been  able to find  out 
any  other  motive,  but the  revolutionary principle, that  of  trying to  support, 

237 

Karl Marx 

to  encourage  all  that is  likely to  subvert established governments.  I believe 
we  ought  never  to  give  in to  such  a  snare. 

V.) 

London,  November  30,  1839. 
I  learn  from  an  authentic  source, that Lord Palmerston, in the last council 
of Ministers, in giving an account of the situation of Oriental affairs, and on 
the differences existing between the French and English policies, did so with 
a  moderation  and  a  regard  for  the  alliance  of  both  countries,  that  deserve 
our gratitude.  He  has  even  drawn the attention of his colleagues to a system 
similar  to  that  mentioned  by  me.  In  conclusion  he  has yielded  as to  forms, 
and has  renounced  a policy  of  action  and  of inevitable  complication.

London,  Dec.  12,1839. 
I  have  seen  Lord  Palmerston,  as  I was  anxious  to know,  whether he had 
to  inform  me  of  anything  respecting  the  communication  he  recently  made 
to  me.  He  has  read  to  me the letter of M.  de Nessekodeto the Russian  Chargé 
d'Affaires,  which  corresponded  exactly to  what he  had told me. The arrival 
of  M.  de Brunnow will initiate  us  into  the  secret thoughts  of  the  Cabinet of 
St.  Petersburg.  Lord  Palmerston has  been  charming in forms  and  in matter. 
He  views  with pleasure  the  return  of good feelings between the French and 
English  Cabinets,  and the continuation of the  alliance.  Believe me, I do  not 
exaggerate  in  this.  I  told  him  with  the  confidence  of  truth,  that  the  new  20 
situation was  exactly such as France had  ever wished it to be.  He was forced 
to  recognize  it  himself.  The  Prince  of  Esterhazy  has  written  to  his  Chargé 
d'Affaires  that  he  had  been  extremely  content  with  the  Marshal,  and  that 
he  was  trying  at  this  moment to bring back the French Cabinet to an  entente 
with Austria, but that he had found the King unmanageable. I can well believe 25 
it.  The  King does not lend his mind to  such impracticable  divagations. This 
I write for you alone.  Indeed, I believe with your Royal Highness that Russia 
will  be  caught  in  her  own  nets. 

VII.) 

London,  December,  18th  1839. 

I  have  received  this  morning a dispatch,  more than usually  strange, from  30 

the  Marshal.  It  is  an  answer  to  the  letter  in which  I reported to him on the 
communication  I  made  to  Lord  Palmerston,  in  regard  to  the  impression 
evoked at Paris on the announcement of the new mission of M. de Brunnow, 
and  of  its  aim.  I  have  read  to  Lord  Palmerston  textuellement the  paragraph 
of the  dispatch addressed to me by the Marshal. But in the statement I made  35 
to  him about it, I made use of such terms as rendered the  same ideas without 
being  identical  with  those  of the Marshal.  Now the Marshal is  kind enough 
to  assure  me  that  there  was  no  difference  between  my  words  and  his  own 

238

expression; but he recommends me that I ought to double my circumspection 
and  endeavor  to  reestablish  in  our  negotiations  the  textual  meaning  of  his 
own dispatches.  I  am much mistaken if this be  not a  querelle allemande, a 
subtlety  worthy  of  a  Grec  du  Bas-Empte...  The  Marshal  is  a novice in the 
career of  diplomacy,  and  I fear that he seeks ability in fineness. He can find 
it  only  in  sincerity  and  straightforwardness.

Yesterday  Lord  Palmerston  dined  with  me,  in  common  with  the  whole 
Corps  Diplomatique  . ..  He  told  me  that Ministers  were  going to  ask for  a 
supplementary  vote  for  their naval forces, but he  stated that he would pro 
pose  to  his  colleagues  not  to  demand it  on  account  of  the  reinforcements 
of the  French  fleet,  in  order to  avoid wounding  an  ally by the least allusion. 
Lord  Holland  and  Lord  John  Russell  are  admirable  in  their  efforts  for 
maintaining  the  alliance.

London,  Jan.  20,1840. 
Lord Palmerston has  communicated to  me  the  project  of  a convention to 
be  submitted  to  the  Great Powers  and to the Porte  . ..  It is  not a convention 
of the five Great Powers between themselves, but a convention of those same 
Powers with the Porte. M. de Brunnow objects to that form (see Nesselrode's 
20  note,  dated  2d July,  inst.,  about the Russian initiative!)  . .. This convention 
consists  of  a  preamble  and  of  VIII  articles:  in  the  former  it  is  stated  in  a 
positive  manner,  and  almost  textualry,  that  the  integrity  of  the  Ottoman 
Empire  being  essentially  necessary  for  the  maintenance  of  the  peace  of 
Europe,  the  five  Powers  are  disposed  to  lend  it  the  requisite  support,  and 
to  make  it  enter  into  the  international  confidence  of  Europe.  The  articles 
regulate  that  s u p p o r t . ..

P.S.—I  learn,  at  this  moment,  that  Brunnow  and  Neumann  are  utterly 

discontented  with  the  convention  of Lord Palmerston.

London,  January  21,1840. 
The  project  of  convention  drawn  up  by  Lord  Palmerston  appears  to  me 
to  have  been  rejected  by  the  Russian  and  Austrian  negotiators.  M.  de 
Neumann  distinguished  himself  by  the  violence,  and,  I  venture  to  say,  the 
stupidity  of  his  complaints.  He  unveils  the  policy  of  his  Court.  Prince 
Metternich,  who  intended  to  sustain  in  his  hands  the  balance  of  power, 
35  openly avows  his hatred of Russia.  He  flattered  himself to  see the proposi 
tions  of  Brunnow  received  without  restrictions,  and  both  have  been  dis 
appointed  to  find  in  Lord  Palmerston  a  Minister  who  desires  sincerely  an 
alliance  with  France,  and  who  is  anxious  to  operate  in  understanding  with 
her.

To-day I had a long conversation with Lord Melbourne, who is  a thorough

him some means by which a combination of the  French and English proposi

5 

He judges  in the  same light as we do the  intentions  of Russia, and he told 
me, in a conference with regard to the  Vienna Cabinet,  that it was not to be 
trusted, because it ever turned out in the end, to be the devoted partisan of 
Russia.

The turn now being taken by the Oriental affairs is alarming to m e . .. There 
is  no  doubt that Russia is  pushing to war, and that Austria supports her with 
all  her  forces  . ..  They  have  succeeded  in  frightening  England  with  the 
"projects  of  France  on  the  Mediterranean."  Algiers  and  Mehemet  Ali  are 
the  two  means  employed by  them  . ..  I  make  all possible  efforts  to  obtain  15 
the  rejection  of  the  Brunnow  propositions,  and  I  had  narrowly  succeeded 
in it,  when they  heard  of it,  and Austria now presents the Brunnow proposi 
tions  as  her  own.  This  is  an  evident  trickery.  But  the  Council  has  been 
convoked,  in order to  deliberate  on the Austrian propositions.  It  is  divided. 
On the one side, there are Lord Melbourne, Lord Holland and Mr. Labouche-  20 
re ; on the other, Lord Palmerston, Lord J. Russell, and Lord Minto. The other 
members  are  fluctuating  between  the  two  opinions.

between  six,  and not between five  (powers,)  as proposed by  M.  de Brunnow, 
who  was  not  wanting  in  zeal  for  his  particular  interests,  (solicitude for the 
Ottoman  Empire!)  The  Porte  would  not consent to  a  Convention  discussed 
and  settled without its cooperation. By signing a Treaty with the five Great 
Powers she would come in consequence of this fact itself under the European 30 
law  of nations.

Are  the  politics  and  the  interest  of  the  King  given  up  to  the  caprices  of 
M.  Thiers  and his  newspaper? The system founded with so great pains, with 
such efforts, and maintained, notwithstanding so many difficulties, for more  35 
than  ten  years,  is  doomed  to  destruction.

5  The  Czar  has  not  only  commenced  war, he  has  already terminated  his first 
campaign.  The  line  of  operations  is  no  longer  behind  the  Pruth,  but  along 
the Danube. Meanwhile, what are the Western Powers  about? They counsel, 
i.e.  compel the Sultan to consider the war as peace. Their answers to the acts 
of  the  autocrat are not cannons, but notes.  The  Emperor is  assailed,  not by 
1 o the two fleets, but by no less than four projects of negotiation. One emanating 
from  the  English Cabinet,  the  other from  the French, the third presented by 
Austria,  and the fourth improvised by the "brother-in-law" of Potsdam.  The 
Czar,  it  is  hoped,  will  consent to  select from  this  embarras  de richesse that 
which  is  most  suitable to  his  purposes.  The  (second)  reply of M.  Drouin de 
l'Huys to the (second) note of M. de Nesselrode takes infinite pains to prove 
that  "it  was  not  England  and  France  who  made  the  first  demonstration." 
Russia  only  throws  out  so  many notes  to  the western diplomats, like bones 
to  dogs,  in order to  set them  at an innocent amusement,  while  she reaps the 
advantage  of  further  gaining  time.  England  and France, of course, catch the 
20  bait.  As  if  the  receipt  of  such  a  note  were  not  a  sufficient  degradation,  it 
received  a  most  pacific  comment  in  the  Journal  de 1'Empte  in  an  article 
signed by M.  de la Guéronnière, but written from notes given by the Emperor 
and^ revised  by  him.  That  article  "would  permit  to  Russia  the  caprice  of 
negotiating  on  the  right  bank  rather  than  on  the  left  bank  of  the  Pruth."  It 
actually  converts  the  second  note  of Count Nesselrode  into an  "attempt at 
reconciliation."  This  is  done  in the following  style:  "Count Nessehode now 
speaks only of a moral guarantee, and he announces that, for it, is substituted 

25 

241 

Karl  Marx 

provisionally a material guarantee thus making a direct appeal to negotiation. 
That  being  the  case  it  is  impossible  to  consider  the  action  of  diplomatists 
exhausted."  The  Assemblée Nationale,  the  Russian  Moniteur  at  Paris,  ironi 
cally congratulates  the  Journal de l'Empire for its  discovery, however late 
it had come to it, and regrets only that so much noise should have been made 
to  no  purpose.

The English press has lost all countenance. "The Czar cannot comprehend 
the  courtesy  which  the  Western  Powers  have  shown  to  him  . ..  He  is  in 
capable  of  courteous  demeanor  in  his  transactions  with other powers."  So 
says The Morning Advertiser. The Morning Post is exasperated because the 10 
Czar  takes  so  Utile  note  of  the  internal  embarras of  his  opponents: 

"To  have  put  forward, in the  mere wantonness  of insolence,  a claim  that 
possessed no  character of immediate  urgency,  and to  have  done  so  without 
any reference to the inflammable state of Europe, was an indiscretion almost 
incredible." 

The  writer  of  the  Money  Market  article  in  The  Economist finds  out 
"that  men  discover  now  to  their  cost,  how  inconvenient  it  is  that  all  the 
most  secret interests of the world (i.e., of the Exchange,) are dependent upon 
the  vagaries  of  one  man." 

15 

Yet in  1848 and  '49 you could  see the bust of the  Emperor of Russia side  20 

by  side  with  the  veau  d'or itself. 

Meanwhile the position of the Sultan is becoming every hour more difficult 
and  compUcated.  His  financial  embarrassments  increase  the  more,  as  he 
bears  all  the  burdens,  without  reaping  any  of  the  good  chances  of  war. 
Popular  enthusiasm turns round upon him for want of being directed against 
the  Czar.  The fanaticism of the Mussulman threatens him with palace revolu 
tions,  while  the  fanaticism  of  the  Greek  menaces  him  with  popular  in 
surrections.  The  papers  of  to-day  contain  reports  of  a  conspiracy  directed 
against the Sultan's Ufe by Mussulman students belonging to the old Turkish 
party,  who  wanted to  place  Abdul-Aziz on the  throne.

In  the  House  of  Lords,  yesterday,  Lord  Clarendon was  asked  by  Lords 
Beaumont and  Malmesbury to  state his intentions, now that the Emperor of 
France had not hesitated to pronounce his. Lord Clarendon, however, beside 
a  brief  avowal  that  England had  indorsed the  note  of  M.  Drouin  de  l'Huys, 
concealed  himself  behind  his  entrenchment  of promises that he would  cer-  35 
tainly very  soon give full information to the  House.  On the question whether 
it  was  true  that  the  Russians  had  also  seized the  Civil Government and the 
Post-Offices  of  the  PrincipaUties,  which  they  had  placed  under  military 
occupation,  Lord  Clarendon  remained  "silent,"  of  course!  "He  would  not 
beüeve  it,  after the  proclamation of Prince  Gortschakoff."  Lord Beaumont  40 
replied,  he  seemed  to  be  very  sanguine  indeed.

To  a  question  concerning  the  late  Smyrna affray,  put by  Sir J. Walmsley 
in  the  House  of  Commons,  Lord  John  Russell  replied  that  he  had  heard 
indeed  of the kidnapping of one Hungarian refugee by the Consul of Austria; 
but  as  to  Austria  having  demanded  the  extradition  of  all  Hungarian  and 
Italian refugees,  he  had  certainly heard nothing of that.  Lord John manages 
interpellations  in  a  style  altogether  pleasant  and  not  without  convenience 
to  himself.  Official  information  he  never  receives;  and  in  the  news 
papers  he  never  reads  anything  that  you  want  him,  or  expect  him  to  have 
read. 

10 

The  Kölnische  Zeitung in  a  letter  dated  Vienna,  July  11,  contains  the 

following  report  on  the  Smyrna  affair: 

"Shekib  Effendi  has  been  sent  to  Smyrna  in  order  to  commence  an  in 
struction  against  the  authors  of  the  sedition  in  which  M.  de  Hackelberg 
perished.  Shekib has  also  received  orders  to  deliver  to  Austria the  refugees 
15  of  Austrian or Tuscan  origin.  Mr.  Brown,  Chargé  d'Affaires  of the United 
States, has  had communications on this  subject with Reshid Pasha, the result 
of which was not yet known.  I hear at this  moment that the assassin of Baron 
Hackelberg  has  received  from  the  American  Consul  at  Smyrna  a  passport 
that places him out of the reach of the Turkish authorities. This fact proves 
20 that the United States intend intervening in European affairs. It is also sure 
that three American men-of-war are with the Turkish fleet in the Bosphorus, 
and  further,  that  the  American  frigate  Cumberland  has  brought  80,000,000 
of  piasters  to  the  Turkish  Government." 

Whatever truth there be  in this and like reports, they prove one thing, viz: 
that American intervention is expected everywhere, and is even looked upon 
with favor by portions  of  the  English public.  The  behavior  of  the  American 
Captain and Consul are loudly praised in popular meetings, and the "English 
man"  in  The Advertiser oí  yesterday  called  the  Stars  and  Stripes  to  appear 
in  the  Mediterranean  and  to  shame  the  "muddy  old  Union  Jack"  into  ac-
tion. 

25 

30 

To  sum  up  the  Eastern  question  in  a  few  words:  The  Czar,  vexed  and 
dissatisfied at seeing his immense Empire confined to one sole port of export, 
and that even  situated  in  a  sea innavigable  through one half of the year, and 
assailable  by  Englishmen through the  other half, is pushing the design of his 
35  ancestors,  to  get  access  to  the  Mediterranean;  he  is  separating,  one  after 
another, the  remotest members  of the  Ottoman  Empire  from its main body, 
tiH  at  last  Constantinople,  the  heart,  must  cease  to  beat.  He  repeats  his 
periodical invasions  as  often as  he thinks his designs on Turkey endangered 
by  the  apparent  consolidation  of  the  Turkish  government,  or  by  the  more 
40  dangerous  symptoms of self-emancipation manifest amongst the Slavonians. 
Counting  on  the  cowardice  and  apprehensions  of  the  Western  Powers,  he 

243 

Karl  Marx 

bullies Europe, and pushes his demands as far as possible, in order to appear 
magnanimous  afterward,  by  contenting  himself  with  what  he  immediately 
wanted. 

The  Western  Powers,  on  the  other  hand,  inconsistent,  pusillanimous, 
suspecting  each  other,  commence  by  encouraging  the  Sultan  to  resist  the 
Czar,  from fear of the encroachments of Russia, and terminate by compelling 
the former to yield, from fear of a general war giving rise to  a general revolu 
tion.  Too  impotent  and  too  timid  to  undertake  the  reconstruction  of  the 
Ottoman  Empire  by  the  establishment  of  a  Greek  Empire,  or  of  a  Federal 
Republic  of  Slavonic  States,  all  they  aim  at,  is  to  maintain  the  status  quo,  10 
i.e., the  state of putrefaction which forbids the  Sultan to emancipate himself 
from  the  Czar,  and  the  Slavonians  to  emancipate  themselves  from  the 
Sultan. 

5 

The revolutionary party can only congratulate  itself on this  state of things. 
The humiliation of the reactionary western governments, and their manifest  15 
impotency  to  guard  the  interests  of  European  civilization  against  Russian 
encroachment cannot fail to work out a wholesome indignation in the people 
who  have  suffered  themselves,  since  1849,  to  be  subjected  to  the  rule  of 
Counter-revolution.  The  approaching  industrial  crisis,  also,  is  affected  and 
accelerated  quite  as  much by this semi-Eastern complication as by the com-  20 
pletely  Eastern  complication  of  China.  While  the  prices  of  corn  are  rising, 
business  in general is  suspended,  at the same time that the rate of Exchange 
is  setting  against  England,  and  gold  is  beginning  to  flow  to  the  Continent. 
The  stock  of  bullion  in  the  Bank  of  France  has  fallen  off  between  the  9th 
of  June  and  the  14th  of July  the  sum  of £2,220,000, which is more than the  25 
entire  augmentation  which  had  taken  place  during  the  preceding  three 
months. 

The  progress  of  the  India  bill  through  the  Committee  has  little  interest. 
It  is  significant,  that  all  amendments  are  thrown  out  now  by  the  Coalition 
coalescing  with  the  Tories  against  their  own  allies  of  the  Manchester  30 
School. 

The  actual  state  of  India  may  be  illustrated  by  a  few  facts.  The  Home 
Establishment absorbs 3  per cent,  of the net revenue,  and the annual interest 
for Home Debt and Dividends  14 per cent—together  17 per cent. If we deduct 
these  annual  remittances  from  India  to  England,  the  military  charges  amount  35 
to  about  two-thirds of the whole expenditure  available for India, or to 56 per 
cent,  while  the  charges  for  Public  Works do  not amount to  more  than 2lU 
per cent, of the general revenue, or for Bengal  1  per cent., Agra TU, Punjaub 
Vs, Madras  V2,  and Bombay  1  per cent, of their respective revenues. These 
figures  are  the  official  ones  of  the  Company  itself. 

40 

On the  other hand nearly three-fifths of the whole  net revenue  are  derived 

244 

The  War  Question—Doings  of  Parliament—India 

from  the  land,  about  one-seventh  from  opium,  and  upward  of  one-ninth 
from  salt.  These  resources  together  yield  85  per  cent,  of  the  whole  re 
ceipts. 

As  to minor items  of  expenditure  and  charges,  it may  suffice to  state that 
the  Moturpha  revenue  maintained  in  the  Presidency  of  Madras,  and levied 
on  shops,  looms,  sheep,  cattle,  sundry  professions,  etc.,  yields  somewhat 
about £50,000,  while  the  yearly  dinners  of the  East India House cost about 
the  same  sum. 

The great bulk of the revenue is derived from the land. As the various kinds 
of  Indian  land-tenure  have  recently  been  described  in  so  many places,  and 
in  popular  style,  too,  I  propose  to  limit  my  observations  on  the  subject  to 
a  few  general  remarks  on  the  Zemindaree  and  Ryotwar  systems. 

The  Zemindaree  and  Ryotwar  were  both  of  them  agrarian  revolutions, 
effected by  British  ukases,  and  opposed  to  each  other;  the  one  aristocratic, 
the other  democratic;  the one  a caricature  of  English landlordism, the other 
of French peasant-proprietorship; both pernicious, both combining the most 
contradictory character—both made not for the people, who cultivate the soil, 
nor  for  the  holder,  who  owns  it,  but  for  the  Government  that  taxes  it. 

By  the  Zemindaree  system,  the people  of the Presidency of  Bengal were 
depossessed  at  once  of  their  hereditary  claims  to  the  soil,  in  favor  of  the 
native  tax gatherers called Zemindars. By the ryotwar system introduced into 
the  Presidencies  of  Madras  and  Bombay,  the  native  nobility,  with  their 
territorial  claims,  merassees,  jagheers  etc., were  reduced with the  common 
people  to  the  holding of  minute fields,  cultivated by themselves  in favor of 
the  Collector  of  the  East  India  Company.  But  a  curious  sort  of  English 
landlord was the zemindar, receiving only one-tenth of the rent, while he had 
to  make  over nine-tenths  of  it to  the  Government.  A  curious  sort of French 
peasant  was  the  ryot,  without  any  permanent  title  in the  soil,  and  with the 
taxation changing every  year  in proportion to  his harvest. The original class 
of  Zemindars,  notwithstanding  their  unmitigated  and uncontrolled  rapacity 
against the  depossessed  mass  of  the ex-hereditary landholders,  soon melted 
away  under  the  pressure  of  the  Company,  in  order  to  be  replaced  by  mer 
cantile  speculators  who  now  hold  all  the  land  of  Bengal, with exception of 
the estates returned under the  direct management of the Government. These 
speculators  have  introduced  a  variety  of  the  Zemindaree  tenure  called 
patnee.  Not  content  to  be  placed  with  regard  to  the  British  Government in 
the  situation of middlemen, they have created in their turn a class of "heredi 
tary"  middlemen  called patnetas, who created again their  sub-patnetas,  etc., 
so  that  a  perfect  scale  of  hierarchy  of  middlemen  has  sprung  up,  which 
presses  with  its  entire weight on the unfortunate cultivator.  As to the ryots 
in  Madras  and  Bombay,  the  system  soon  degenerated  into  one  of  forced 

245 

Karl Marx 

cultivation,  and  the  land lost  all its  value.  "The  land,"  says  Mr.  Campbell, 
"would  be  sold  for balances by the  Collector,  as  in Bengal, but generally is 
not,  for  a  very  good  reason,  viz:  that  nobody  will  buy  it." 

5 

Thus, in Bengal, we have a combination of English landlordism of the Irish 
middlemen  system,  of  the  Austrian  system,  transforming  the  landlord  into 
the  taxgatherer, and of the Asiatic  system making the State the real landlord. 
In  Madras  and  Bombay  we  have  a French peasant proprietor who is  at the 
same  time  a  serf,  and  a  metayer  of  the  State.  The  drawbacks  of  all  these 
various  systems  accumulate  upon  him  without  his  enjoying  any  of  their 
redeeming  features.  The  ryot  is  subject,  like  the  French  peasant,  to  the  10 
extortion of the  private  usurer; but he has no  hereditary, no permanent title 
in his  land, like  the  French peasant.  Like the serf he is forced to cultivation, 
but  he  is  not  secured  against want like  the  serf.  Like  the  metayer he  has  to 
divide  his  produce  with the  State,  but the  State  is  not  obliged,  with regard 
to him, to  advance  the funds  and the  stock,  as it is obliged to do with regard  15 
to the metayer. In Bengal, as in Madras and Bombay, under the Zemindaree 
as  under  the  ryotwar,  the  ryots—and  they  form  "/nths  of  the  whole  Indian 
population—have  been  wretchedly  pauperized;  and  if  they  are,  morally 
speaking,  not  sunk  as  low  as  the Irish cottiers, they owe it to their climate, 
the men of the  South being possessed of less wants, and of more imagination  20 
than  the  men  of  the  North. 

Conjointly with  the land-tax we have to consider the  salt-tax. Notoriously 
the  Company retain the monopoly of that article which they sell at three times 
its  mercantile  value—and  this  in  a  country  where  it is  furnished by the  sea, 
by  the  lakes,  by  the  mountains  and the  earth  itself.  The  practical  working  25 
of  this  monopoly  was  described  by  the  Earl  of  Albemarle  in  the  following 
words: 

"A  great  proportion  of  the  salt  for  inland  consumption  throughout  the 
country  is  purchased  from  the  Company  by  large  wholesale  merchants  at 
less  than 4 rupees per maund:  these mix  a fixed proportion of  sand,  chiefly  30 
got a few miles to the  south-east of Dacca, and  send the mixture to a second, 
or,  counting  the  Government  as  the  first,  to  a  third  monopolist  at  about  5 
or 6 rupees.  This  dealer  adds  more  earth or ashes,  and thus passing through 
more  hands,  from  the  large  towns  to  villages,  the  price  is  still  raised  from 
8  to  10  rupees  and  the  proportion  of  adulteration from 25 to 40 per cent.  It  35 
appears  then  that  the  people  pay  from  £21,17s.  2d.  to  £27,6s.  2d.  for  their 
salt,  or  in  other  words,  from  30 to  36 times  as  much as the wealthy people 
of  Great  Britain." 

As  an instance  of English bourgeois morals,  I may allege, that Mr. Camp 

bell  defends  the  Opium  monopoly  because  it  prevents  the  Chinese  from  40 
consuming  too  much  of  the  drug,  and  that he defends the Brandy monopoly 

246 

The War Question—Doings of  Parliament—India 

(licenses  for  spMt-selling  in India)  because  it has wonderfully increased the 
consumption  of  Brandy  in  India. 

The  Zemindar  tenure,  the  ryotwar,  and  the  salt  tax,  combined  with  the 
Indian  climate,  were  the  hotbeds  of the cholera—the Indian's revenge upon 
the Western World—a striking and  severe example of the solidarity of human 
woes  and  wrongs.

I propose in this letter to conclude my observations on India. 

5 

How came it that English supremacy was established in India? The para- 
mount power of the Great Mogul was broken by the  Mogul Viceroys. The 
power  of  the  Viceroys  was  broken  by  the  Mahrattas.  The  power  of  the 
Mahrattas was broken by the Af fghans, and while all were struggling against 
all, the Briton rushed in and was enabled to subdue them all. A country not 
only divided between Mahommedan and Hindoo, but between tribe and tribe, ι o 
between  caste  and  caste;  a  society  whose  framework was  based  on  a  sort 
of  equilibrium,  resulting  from  a  general  repulsion  and  constitutional  ex-
clusiveness between all its members. Such a country and such a society, were 
they not the predestined prey of conquest? If we knew nothing of the past 
history of Hindostán, would there not be the one great and incontestable fact,  15 
that even at this moment India is held in English thraldom by an Indian army 
maintained at the cost of India? India, then, could not escape the fate of being 
conquered,  and the  whole  of her  past history, if it be  anything, is the history 
of the  successive conquests  she has undergone. Indian society has no history 
at  all,  at  least  no  known history.  What we call its history,  is but the history  20 
of  the  successive  intruders who founded  their  empires  on the passive  basis 
of  that  unresisting  and  unchanging  society.  The  question,  therefore,  is  not 
whether  the English had a right to conquer India, but whether we are to prefer 
India  conquered  by  the  Turk,  by  the  Persian,  by the  Russian,  to  India con 
quered  by the  Briton. 

25 

England  has  to  fulfill  a double mission in India: one destructive, the other 
regenerating—the  annihilation  of  old  Asiatic  society,  and  the  laying  the 
material  foundations  of  Western  society  in  Asia. 

248 

The  Future  Results  of  British  Rule  in  India

Arabs, Turks, Tartars, Moguls, who had successively overrun India, soon 
became  Hindooized,  the  barbarian  conquerors  being,  by  an  eternal  law  of 
history,  conquered themselves  by the  superior  civilization of their  subjects. 
The  British  were  the  first  conquerors  superior,  and  therefore,  inaccessible 
to  Hindoo  civilization.  They  destroyed  it  by  breaking  up  the  native  com 
munities, by uprooting the native industry, and by levelling all that was great 
and  elevated  in  the  native  society.  The  historic  pages  of  their  rule  in India 
report  hardly  anything  beyond  that  destruction.  The  work  of  regeneration 
hardly  transpires  through  a  heap  of  ruins.  Nevertheless  it  has  begun. 

is 

10 

The political unity of India, more consolidated, and extending farther than 
it ever did under the  Great Moguls, was the first condition of its regeneration. 
That  unity,  imposed  by  the  British  sword,  will  now  be  strengthened  and 
perpetuated by the electric telegraph. The native army, organized and trained 
by  the  British  drill-sergeant,  was  the  sine  qua non of  Indian  self-émancipa 
tion,  and  of  India  ceasing  to  be  the  prey  of  the  first  foreign  intruder.  The 
free  press,  introduced  for  the  first  time  into  Asiatic  society,  and  managed 
principally  by  the  common  offspring  of  Hindoos  and  Europeans,  is  a  new 
and  powerful  agent  of  reconstruction.  The  Zemindaree  and Ryotwar  them 
selves,  abominable as they are, involve two distinct forms of private property 
in land—the  great  desideratum  of  Asiatic  society.  From  the  Indian natives, 
reluctantly  and  sparingly  educated  at  Calcutta,  under  English  superin 
tendence,  a  fresh  class  is  springing  up,  endowed with the requirements  for 
government  and  imbued  with  European  science.  Steam  has  brought  India 
into  regular  and  rapid  communication with Europe,  has  connected  its chief 
25  ports  with  those  of  the  whole  south-eastern  ocean,  and  has  revindicated it 
from  the  isolated  position  which  was  the  prime  law  of  its  stagnation.  The 
day  is  not  far distant when, by a combination of railways  and  steam-vessels, 
the distance between England and India, measured by time, will be shortened 
to  eight  days,  and  when  that  once  fabulous  country  will  thus  be  actually 

20 

30  annexed  to  the  Western world. 

35 

The  ruling  classes  of  Great  Britain  have  had,  t ul  now, but an accidental, 
transitory  and  exceptional interest in the progress  of India.  The  aristocracy 
wanted  to  conquer  it,  the  moneyocracy to  plunder it,  and  the  millocracy to 
undersell it.  But now the tables  are turned.  The  millocracy have discovered 
that  the  transformation of India into  a reproductive  country has become of 
vital  importance  to  them,  and that, to  that end, it is  necessary,  above  all, to 
gift her with means of irrigation and of internal communication.  They intend 
now  drawing  a  net  of  railroads  over  India.  And  they  will  do it.  The  results 
must  be  inappreciable. 

40 

It  is  notorious  that  the  productive  powers  of  India  are  paralyzed  by  the 
utter  want  of  means  for  conveying  and  exchanging  its  various  produce. 

249 

Karl Marx 

Nowhere, more than in India, do we meet with social destitution in the midst 
of  natural  plenty,  for  want  of the  means  of  exchange.  It  was  proved before 
a Committee of the British House of Commons, which sat in 1848, that "when 
grain  was  selling  from  6s.  to  8s.  a  quarter  at  Kandeish,  it was  sold  at  64s. 
to  70s.  at  Poonah,  where  the  people  were  dying  in  the  streets  of  famine, 
without the  possibility  of  gaining  supplies from Kandeish, because the clay-
roads  were  impracticable."

The introduction of  railroads  may  be  easily made to  subserve  agricultural 
purposes  by  the  formation  of  tanks,  where  ground  is  required  for  em 
bankment,  and  by  the  conveyance  of  water  along the  different lines. Thus  10 
irrigation,  the  sine-qua-non of farming in the East, might be greatly extended, 
and  the  frequently  recurring  local  famines,  arising from  the  want of  water, 
would  be  averted.  The  general  importance  of  railways,  viewed under  this 
head,  must  become  evident,  when  we  remember  that  irrigated  lands,  even 
in the  districts near Ghauts, pay three times  as  much in taxes, afford ten or  15 
twelve times  as much employment, and yield twelve or fifteen times as much 
profit,  as  the  same  area  without  irrigation. 

Railways  will  afford  the  means  of  diminishing the  amount and the cost of 
the  military  establishments.  Col.  Warren,  Town  Major  of  the  Fort  St.  Wil 
liam,  stated  before  a  Select  Committee  of  the  House  of  Commons: 

20 

"The  practicability  of  receiving  intelligence  from  distant  parts  of  the 
country,  in as many hours as at present it requires days and even weeks, and 
of  sending instructions, with troops  and  stores,  in the more brief period, are 
considerations  which cannot be  too  highly  estimated.  Troops  could be  kept 
at  more  distant  and  healthier  stations than at present,  and  much loss  of life  25 
from  sickness would by  this  means  be  spared.  Stores could not to the  same 
extent  be  required  at  the  various  dépôts,  and  the  loss  by  decay,  and  the 
destruction  incidental  to  the  climate,  would  also  be  avoided.  The  num 
ber  of  troops  might  be  diminished  in  direct  proportion  to  their  effective 
ness." 

30 

We  know  that  the  municipal  organization  and the economical basis of the 
village  communities  has  been  broken  up,  but  their  worst  feature,  the  dis 
solution  of  society  into  stereotype  and  disconnected  atoms,  has  survived 
their  vitality.  The  village-isolation  produced  the  absence  of  roads  in India, 
and  the  absence  of  roads  perpetuated  the  village  isolation.  On  this  plan  a  35 
community  existed  with  a given  scale  of low conveniences,  almost without 
intercourse with other villages, without the  desires and  efforts indispensable 
to  social  advance.  The  British  having  broken  up  this  self-sufficient  inertia 
of  the  villages,  railways  will  provide  the  new  want  of  communication  and 
intercourse.  Besides, "one of the effects of the railway system will be to bring  40 
into  every  village  affected  by  it  such  knowledge  of  the  contrivances  and 

250 

The  Future  Results  of  British  Rule  in  India 

appliances of other countries, and such means of obtaining them,  as will first 
put  the  hereditary  and  stipendiary  village  artisanship  of  India  to  full proof 
of  its  capabilities,  and then  supply  its  defects."  (Chapman,  the  Cotton and 
Commerce  of  India.) 

5 

15 

I  know  that  the  English  millocracy  intend  to  endow  India with  railways 
with the  exclusive view of extracting at  tìminished  expenses the Cotton and 
other  raw  materials  for  their  manufactures.  But  when  you  have  once  in 
troduced  machinery  into  the  locomotion of  a country,  which possesses iron 
and  coals,  you  are  unable  to  withhold  it  from  its  fabrication.  You  cannot 
10  maintain a net of railways  over an immense  country without introducing all 
those  industrial  processes  necessary  to  meet  the  immediate  and  current 
wants  of  railway  locomotion,  and  out  of which there must grow the applica 
tion of  machinery to  those  branches  of  industry not immediately connected 
with railways.  The railway-system will therefore become, in India, truly the 
forerunner  of modern industry. This is the more  certain as the Hindoos  are 
allowed  by  British  authorities  themselves to  possess  particular  aptitude  for 
accommodating themselves to entirely new labor, and acquiring the requisite 
knowledge  of  machinery.  Ample proof  of this fact is afforded by the capaci 
ties  and expertness  of the  native  engineers  in the  Calcutta mint, where they 
20  have been for years employed in working the steam machinery, by the natives 
attached  to  the  several  steam  engines  in  the  Hurdwar  coal  district,  and  by 
other  instances.  Mr.  Campbell  himself,  greatly  influenced  as  he  is  by  the 
prejudices of the East India company, is obliged to avow "that the great mass 
of  the  Indian  people  possesses  a  great  industrial  energy,  is  well  fitted  to 
accumulate  capital,  and  remarkable  for  a  mathematical  clearness  of  head, 
and  talent  for  figures  and exact  sciences."  "Their intellects,"  he  says,  "are 
excellent." Modern industry, resulting from the railway system, will dissolve 
the  hereditary  divisions  of  labor,  upon  which  rest  the  Indian  castes,  those 
decisive  impediments  to  Indian  progress  and  Indian  power. 

25 

30 

35 

All  the  English bourgeoisie  may be  forced  to  do  will neither emancipate 
nor materially mend the social condition of the mass of the people, depending 
not only on the  development of the productive powers, but on their appropri 
ation  by  the  people.  But  what  they  will  not  fail  to  do  is  to  lay  down  the 
material premises for both.  Has the bourgeoisie ever done more? Has it ever 
effected  a progress  without  dragging  individuals  and people through blood 
and  dirt,  through  misery  and  degradation? 

The Indians will not reap the fruits of the new elements of society scattered 
among  them  by  the  British bourgeoisie,  till  in  Great  Britain  itself  the  now 
ruling classes  shall  have  been  supplanted by  the  industrial proletariat, or till 
the  Hindoos  themselves  shall  have  grown  strong  enough to  throw  off  the 
English yoke altogether. At all events, we may safely expect to see, at a more 

40 

251 

Karl Marx 

or less  remote  period,  the regeneration of that great and interesting country, 
whose gentle  natives  are,  to  use  the  expression of Prince  Soltykow, even in 
the  most inferior  classes,  "plus fins et plus adroits que les Italiens, " whose 
submission even is  counterbalanced by a certain calm nobility, who, notwith 
standing  their  natural  langor,  have  astonished  the  British  officers  by  their 
bravery, whose  country has been the  source of our languages, our religions, 
and  who  represent  the  type  of  the  ancient  German  in  the  Jat,  and the  type 
of  the  ancient  Greek  in  the  Brahmin. 

5 

I cannot part with the subject of India without some concludingremarks. 
The profound hypocrisy  and inherent barbarism  of bourgeois-civilization  10 

lies  unveiled  before  our  eyes,  turning  from  its  home,  where  it  assumes 
respectable  forms,  to  the  colonies,  where  it  goes  naked.  They  are  the  de 
fenders  of  property,  but  did  any  revolutionary party  ever  originate  agrarian 
revolutions  like  those  in  Bengal,  in  Madras,  and  in Bombay?  Did they not, 
in  India,  to  borrow  an  expression  of  that  great robber,  Lord  Clive  himself,  15 
resort  to  atrocious  extortion,  when  simple  corruption  could  not  keep  pace 
with their rapacity? While they prated in Europe about the inviolable sanctity 
of  the  national  debt,  did  they  not  confiscate  in  India the  dividends  of  the 
rayahs, who had invested their private  savings in the Company's own funds? 
While  they combatted the  French revolution under the pretext of defending  20 
"our  holy religion,"  did they not forbid,  at the  same  time,  Christianity to be 
propagated  in  India,  and  did  they  not,  in  order  to  make  money  out  of  the 
pilgrims  streaming  to  the  temples  of  Orissa  and  Bengal,  take  up  the  trade 
in the murder and prostitution perpetrated in the temple of Juggernaut? These 
are  the  men of  "Property,  Order,  Family,  and  Religion." 

25 

The  devastating  effects  of  English  industry,  when  contemplated  with 
regard  to India,  a country  as vast as  Europe,  and containing  150  millions  of 
acres,  are  palpable  and  confounding.  But we  must  not forget  that  they  are 
only  the  organic  results  of  the  whole  system  of  production  as  it  is  now 
constituted.  That  production  rests  on  the  supreme  rule  of  capital.  The  30 
centralization  of  capital  is  essential  to  the  existence  of  capital  as  an  inde 
pendent  power.  The  destructive  influence  of  that  centralization  upon  the 
markets  of  the  world  does  but  reveal,  in  the  most  gigantic  dimensions,  the 
inherent  organic  laws  of  political  economy  now  at work  in  every  civilized 
town.  The bourgeois period of history has to create the material basis of the  35 
new  world—on the  one  hand  universal  intercourse founded upon the mutual 
dependency of mankind, and the means of that intercourse ; on the other hand 
the  development  of  the  productive  powers  of  man  and  the  transformation 
of  material  production  into  a  scientific  domination  of  natural  agencies. 
Bourgeois  industry and commerce create these material conditions of a new  40 
world  in  the  same  way  as  geological  revolutions  have  created  the  surface 

252 

The  Future  Results  of  British  Rule  in  India 

of  the  earth.  When a great  social revolution  shall have mastered the results 
of  the  bourgeois-epoch, the  market of the world and the  modern powers of 
production,  and subjected them to the common control of the most advanced 
peoples, then only will human progress cease to resemble that hideous pagan 
idol,  who  would  not  drink  the  nectar  but from  the  skulls  of  the  slain.

Financial  Failure  of  Government—Cabs-
Ireland—The Russian Question. 

Correspondence  of  The  N.Y.Tribune. 

London,  Friday, July 29,  1853. 

Mr.  Gladstone, in the  sitting of the House of Commons of last night brought 
forward  a resolution  that  provision  should  be  made  out  of the  Consolidated 
Fund  for  paying  off  the  South-Sea-Stock  not  commuted  under  his  financial 
scheme.  To  bring  forward such a resolution was to own the complete failure 
of  his  commutation  plan.  Beside  this  small  defeat  the  Ministry  has  had  to 
undergo  a  very  heavy  one  concerning  their  India  Bill.  Sir  John  Pakington 
moved the insertion of a clause, by virtue of which the salt-monopoly should 
cease,  and  enacting  that  the  manufacture  and  sale  of  salt  in  India  shall  be 
absolutely free,  subject only to excise or other duty. The motion was  carried 
by  117  against  107,  notwithstanding the  desperate  exertions  of  Sir  Charles 
Wood,  Lord  John Russell,  Sir  J. Hogg,  Sir  H. Maddock,  and  Mr.  Lowe  (of 
The  Times).  The  oligarchy  having  succeeded  in  raising  the  salary  of  the 
President of the Board of Control to £5,000, propose now to raise the salaries 
of the  immaculate East India Directors from £300 to £1,000, and those of the 
Chairman  and Deputy-Chairman to  £1,500.  Evidently they  suppose  Indiato 
possess the  same miraculous power as is attributed in Hindostán to the leaves 
of a fabulous tree on the extreme hights of the Himalaya, viz: that it converts 
into  gold  everything that it touches—the  only  difference  being that what the 
credulous  Hindoo  expects  from  the  juice  of  the  leaves,  the  enlightened 
Englishman  expects  from  the  blood  of  the  natives. 

The  Chinese  Sultan of the Arabian Nights, who rose one fine morning and 
went  to  his  window  to  look  at  Aladdin's  palace,  was  astonished  to  behold 
nothing but an empty place.  He called  his  Grand  Vizier  and  asked  him  if he 

254 

Financial  Failure  of Government—Cabs—Ireland—The  Russian  Question 

could  see  the  palace.  The  Grand Vizier could  see  nothing,  and  was  not less 
astonished  than  the  Sultan,  who  flew  into  a  passion  and  gave  orders  to  his 
guards  to  arrest Aladdin. The public of London, when it rose on Wednesday 
morning,  found  itself  much  in  the  situation  of  that Chinese  Sultan.  London 
looked  as  if London had gone  out-of-town.  There were and there continued 
to  be  empty  places  where  we  were  wont  to  see  something.  And  as  the  eye 
was  amazed  at the  emptiness  of  the  places,  so  the ear was  amazed  at their 
tomb-like  tranquillity.  What  was  it  that  had  happened  to  London?  A  cab-
revolution;  cabmen  and  cabs  have  disappeared,  as  though by  miracle,  from 
the  streets, from their stands, from the railway stations. The cab-proprietors 
and the drivers are in rebellion against the new Cab act, that great and almost 
"unique"  act  of  the  Ministry  of  all  the  talents.  They  have  struck. 

5

It has  often been observed  that the British public is  seized with periodical 
fits  of  morality,  and that  once  every  six or  seven years, its virtue becomes 
15  outrageous,  and  must  make  a  stand  against  vice.  The  object of  this  moral 
and patriotic fit happened for the present to be poor cabby. His extortions 
from  unprotected females  and fat city men were to  be put down, and  his fare 
to be reduced from  Is. to 6d.  per mile. The  sixpenny morality grew epidemic. 
The  ministry,  by the  organ of  Mr.  Fitzroy, brought in a draconic law against 
20  Cabby, prescribing the terms of the contracts he had to fulfil with the public, 
and  subjecting at the  same time his fares and his  "Hansoms," his horses and 
his  morals to Parliamentary legislation. Cabby, it appears, was to be forcibly 
transformed  into  the  type  of  British  respectability.  The  present generation 
could not do  without improvising at least one virtuous and disinterested class 
25  of citizens,  and Cabby was  selected to form  it.  So  anxious was the ministry 
of  all  the  talents  to  perform its  masterpiece  of legislation, that the  Cab-act, 
hardly  carried  through  the  House,  was  put  into  operation before  any  part 
of  the  machinery  for  working  it  was  ready.  Instead  of  authentic  copies  of 
the  new  regulations  and tables  of fares  and  distances, the  Cadis of  London 
30  having  been  provided  before-hand,  the  police  magistrates  were  advised  to 
decide  any  conflict  arising  between  Cabby  and  the public in the most  sum 
mary way.  Thus,  we had during two weeks the various and elevating specta 
cle  of  a  continuous  fight  before  the  magistrates  between  a  real  army of 6d 
Hampdens  and the  "atrocious"  cabmen,  the  one  fighting for virtue,  and the 
35  others  for  money.  Day  after  day  was  Cabby  moralized,  sentenced,  im 
prisoned.  At  last  he  made  sure that he  was unable to pay his proprietor the 
old  rent  with the new tariff, and proprietor and driver  seceded to their Möns 
Sacer,  to  the  National  Hall,  in  Holborn,  where  they  came  to  the  terrible 
resolution which for three days has produced the cab-desolation of London. 
40  Two things they have  already effected: firstly, that the Ministry through the 
organ  of  Mr.  Fitzroy,  have  amended  their  own  act  so  much  as  nearly  to 

255 

Karl  Marx 

annihilate it; and secondly, that the Eastern question, the Danish coup d'état, 
the  bad  harvest,  and  the  approaching  cholera  have  all  disappeared  before 
that one great  struggle  of public virtue,  which  persists in paying only 6d per 
mile,  and  the  private  interest which persists  in  asking  12 pence. 

"Strike"  is  the  order  of  the  day.  During  the  present  week5,000miners  have  5 

struck  in  the  northern  coal  district;  400  to  500  journeymen  cork-cutters  in 
London;  about 2,000  laborers  employed  by  the  different wharfingers on the 
Thames;  the  police  force  at  Hull,  similar  attempts  being  made  by  the  City 
and  general  Metropolitan Police;  and finally the bricklayers employed  at St. 
Stephens,  under the  very  nose  of Parliament. 

10 

"The  world  is  becoming  a  very  paradise  for laborers.  Men are  becoming 
valuable,"  exclaims  The  Times.  In  the  years  1849,  '50,  '51,  '52, while com 
merce  was  progressively growing,  industry  extending to  unheard-of  dimen 
sions,  and profits continually augmenting, wages in general remained station 
ary, and were  in most instances  even maintained at the reduced  scale occa-  15 
sioned  by  the  crisis  of  1847.  Emigration  having  reduced  the  numbers,  and 
the  rise  in the  prices  of  the first necessaries  having  sharpened  the  appetites 
of  the  people,  strikes  broke  out,  and  wages  rose  in  consequence  of  those 
strikes, and lo ! the world becomes a paradise for laborers—in the eyes of  The 
Times.  In  order  to  reduce  that  paradise  to  terrestrial  dimensions,  the  mill-  20 
lords  of  Lancashire  have  formed  an  association,  for  mutually  assisting  and 
supporting  each  other  against the  demands  of  the  people.  But  not  content 
with  opposing  combination  to  combination,  the  bourgeoisie  threaten  to 
appeal  to  the  interference  of  law—of  law  dictated  by  themselves.  In  what 
manner  this  is  done  may  be  inferred  from  the  following  expectorations  of  25 
The Morning Post, the organ of the liberal and  amiable Palmerston. 

"Ii  there  be  a  piece  of  wickedness  which  preeminently  deserves  to  be 
punished  with  an ton hand,  it is the  system  of  strikes.  . ..  What is wanted 
is  some  stringent and  summary mode of punishing the leaders  and chief men 
of  these  combinations.  It would be  no interference with the freedom of the  30 
labor market  to  treat these fellows  to a ñogging....  It is  idle  to  say that this 
would interfere with the labor market.  As long as those who  supply the labor 
market  refrain  from  jeopardizing  the  interests  of  the  country,  they may be 
left to  make  their  own  terms  with  the  employers." 

Within a certain conventional limit, the laborers shall be allowed to imagine 35 

themselves to be free  agents of production, and that their contracts with their 
masters  are  settled  by  mutual  convention;  but  that  limit passed, labor  is  to 
be  openly  enforced upon them  on conditions  prescribed by Parliament, that 
permanent  Combination Committee  of  the  ruling classes  against the people. 
The  deep  and  philosophical  mind  of  the  Palmerstonian  organ  is  curiously  40 
disclosed in its yesterday's discovery, on that "the hardest used of all classes 

256 

F 

Financial  Failure  of Government—Cabs—Ireland—The  Russian  Question 

in this  country is  the poor of the higher ranks,"  the  poor  aristocrat  who is 
forced  to  use  a  cab  instead  of  a  "brougham"  of  his  own. 

Like  the  world  in  general,  we  are  assured,  that  Ireland  in  particular  is 
becoming  a paradise  for the  laborer,  in  consequence  of famine  and  exodus. 
5  Why  then,  if  wages  really  are  so high in Ireland, is it that Irish laborers  are 
flocking  in  such  masses  over  to  England  to  settle  permanently on this  side 
of  the  "pond,"  while  they  formerly  used  to  return  after  every  harvest?  If 
the  social  amelioration  of  the  Irish  people  is  making  such progress,  how is 
it  that,  on  the  other  hand,  insanity  has  made  such  terrific  progress  among 
them  since  1847, and especially  since 1851? Look at the following data from 
"The  Sixth Report on the  District Criminal  and  Private  Lunatic  Asylums  in 
Ireland": 

10 

1851—Sum  total  of  admissions  in  Lunatic  Asylums 

2,584 

(1,301  males  and  1,283  females.) 

15 

1852 

(1,376  males  and  1,346  females.) 

March,  1853 

(1,447  males  and  1,423  females.) 

2,722 

2,870 

And  this  is  the  same  country  in  which the  celebrated  Swift,  the founder 
20  of  the  first  Lunatic  Asylum in Ireland,  doubted  whether 90 madmen could 

be  found. 

The Chartist agitation reopened by Ernest Jones, is proceeding vigorously, 
and  on  the  30th  i n s t,  a  great  open-air  meeting  of  the  Chartists  of  London 
will  be  held  on  Kennington  Common,  the  place  where  the  great gathering 

25  of April  10,  1848, took place. 

Mr.  Cobbett  has  withdrawn  his  Factory  Bill,  mtimating his  intention  of 

reintroducing  it  early  in  next  session. 

As  to  the  financial  and  general  prospects  of  England  The  Manchester 
Guardian  of  the  27th  inst.,  entirely  confirms  my  own  previous  predictions 
in the  following passages  of  a leading  article:— 

30 

"Seldom  perhaps  has  there  been  a  time  when  there  were  floating  in  our 
commercial atmosphere so many elements of uncertainty calculated to excite 
uneasiness—we  use  that  wild  word  advisedly.  At  any  former  period  before 
the  repeal  of  the  Corn  Laws,  and  the  general  adaptation  of  the  free  trade 
35  policy,  we  should  have  used  the  stronger term  of  serious alarm. These  ele 
ments  are  firstly  the  apprehended  deficiency  of  the  crops,  secondly  the 
continued  abstraction  of  gold  from  the  cellars  of  the  bank,  and  thirdly  the 
great  probability  of  war." 

The last of the Constitutions of  1848, has now been overthrown by the coup 
d'état of the  Danish King.  A Russian  Constitution has  been conferred upon 

40 

257 

Karl Marx 

the country, which, by the abolition of the Lex Regia, was doomed to become 
a Russian Province.  In a subsequent letter I shall give an exposé of the affairs 
of  that  country. 

"It  is  our  policy  to  see  that  nothing  new  happens  during  the  next  four 
months,  and  I  hope  we  shall  accomplish it,  because  men in general prefer 
waiting;  but  the  fifth  must  be  fruitful  in  events."

Thus wrote Count Pozzo di Borgo on the 28th Nov.  1828, to Count Nessel 
rode,  and  Count  Nesselrode  is  now  acting  on  the  same  maxim.  While  the 
military  assumption  of  the  Principalities  was  completed by  the  assumption 
of  their  Civil  Government  by  the  Russians,  while  troops  after  troops  are  10 
pouring into Bessarabia and the Crimea, a hint has been given to Austria that 
her mediation might be accepted, and another to Bonaparte that his proposals 
were  likely to  be  met with  a favorable  reception by  the  Czar. The Ministers 
at Paris  and  London were  comforted  with the prospect that Nicholas would 
condescend  to  definitively  accept their  excuses.  All  the  Courts of Europe,  15 
transformed  into  so  many  Sultanas,  were  anxiously  waiting which of them, 
the  magnanimous  commander  of the  faithful would  throw  his  handkerchief 
to.  Having  kept them in this manner for weeks,  nay for months, in suspense, 
Nicholas  suddenly makes  a declaration that neither England, nor France, nor 
Austria,  nor Prussia,  had  any  business  in his quarrel with Turkey, and that  20 
with  Turkey  alone  he  could  negotiate.  It was  probably in order  to  facilitate 
his  negotiations  with  Turkey,  that  he  recalled  his  embassy  from  Con 
stantinople.  But  while  he  declares  that  the  Powers  are  not  to  meddle  in 
Russia's  concerns,  we  are  informed  on  the  other  hand  that the  representa 
tives  of  France,  England,  Austria  and  Prussia kill  their  time  in  meeting  at  25 
Vienna  in  conference,  and  in  hatching  projects  for  the  arrangement  of  the 
Eastern Question, neither the Turkish nor Russian Ambassador participating 
in  these  mock-conferences.  The  Sultan  had  appointed,  on  the  8th  inst.,  a 
warlike  ministry,  in  order  to  escape  from  his  armed  suspension,  but  was 
compelled by Lord Redcliffe to  dismiss it on the same evening. He has now  30 
been  so  much  confused  that  he  intends  to  send  an  Austrian  courier  to  St. 
Petersburgh with the mission,  of asking whether the Czar would re-enter into 
direct  negotiations.  On  the  return  of that courier  and the  answer he brings, 
shall depend, whether Rechid Pasha is himself to go to St. Petersburgh. From 
St. Petersburg he is to send new draft notes to Constantinople ; the new draft 35 
notes  are to be  returned to  St. Petersburg, and nothing will be  settled before 
the  last  answer is again returned from  St. Petersburg to Constantinople—and 
then the fifth month will have arrived, and no fleets can enter the Black Sea; 
and  then the  Czar will quietly remain during the  winter  in  the principalities, 
where  he  pays  with  the  same  promises  that  still  circulate  there  from  his  40 
former  occupations,  and  as  far  back  as  1820.

Financial  Failure  of  Government—Cabs—Ireland—The  Russian  Question 

You know  that the  Serbian Minister  Garashanin  has  been removed  at the 
instance  of  Russia.  Russia  insists  now,  following  up  that  first triumph,  on 
all  anti Russian officers being expelled the service. This measure, in its turn, 
was intended to be followed by the reigning Prince Alexander, being replaced 
5  by  Prince  Michel  Obrenowich,  the  absolute  tool  of  Russia  and  Russian 
interests. Prince Alexander, to escape from this calamity, and likewise under 
the  pressure  of  Austria,  has  struck  against  the  Sultan,  and  declared  his 
intention of  observing  a  strict neutrality. The Russian intrigues in Serbia are 
thus  described  in  the  Presse  of  Paris: 

10 

"Every  body  knows  that the  Russian  Consulate  at  Orsowa—a miserable 
village  where  not  a  single  Russian  subject is  to  be  found,  but  situated in the 
midst  of  a  Servian  population,  is  only  a poor  establishment,  yet  it  is  made 
the  hotbed  of  Muscovite  propaganda.  The  hand  of  Russia  was  judiciarily 
seized  and  established  in  the  affair  of  Ibraila  in  1840,  and of John Sutzo  in 
15  1850,  in the  affair  of the  recent  arrest  of  14  Russian officers,  which  arrest 
became  the  cause  of the resignation of  Garashanin's  Ministry.  It is likewise 
known  that  Prince  Menchikoff,  during  his  stay at Constantinople, fomented 
similar  intrigues  through  his  agents  at  Broussa,  Smyrna,  as  in Thessalonia, 
Albania  and  Greece." 

20 

There  is  no  more  striking feature  in  the  politics of Russia than the tradi 
tional  identity  not  only  of  her  objects,  but  of her  manner in pursuing them. 
There  is  no  complication  of  the  present  Eastern  Question,  no  transaction, 
no  official  note,  which  does  not  bear  the  stamp  of  quotation  from  known 
pages  of  history. 

25 

Russia  has  now  no  other  pretext  to  urge  against  the  Sultan,  except the 
treaty  of  Kainardji,  although  that treaty gave her,  instead of  a protectorate 
over  her  correligionists, only the right to  build  a chapel  at Stamboul,  and  to 
implore  the  Sultan's  clemency  for  his  Christian  subjects,  as  Reschid Pasha 
justly urged against the Czar in his note of the  14th inst. But already in  1774, 
30  when  that  treaty  was  signed,  Russia intended  to  interpret  it one  day  or the 
other  in  the  sense  of  1853.  The  then  Austrian  Internuncio  at  the  Ottoman 
Porte, Baron Thugut, wrote in the year 1774 to his Court: "Henceforth Russia 
will  always  be  in  a  situation to  effect,  whenever  she may deem the opportu 
nity  favorable,  and without  much preliminary  arrangement,  a descent upon 
35  Constantinople  from  her  ports  on  the  Black  Sea.  In  that case  a conspiracy 
concerted  in  advance  with the  chiefs  of the  Greek religion,  would no  doubt 
burst forth,  and  it would only remain for the  Sultan to  quit his  palace  at the 
first intelligence  of  this  movement  of  the  Russians, to  fly  into  the  depth of 
Asia,  and  abandon  the  throne  of  European  Turkey  to  a more  experienced 
40  possessor.  When  the  capital  shall have  been  conquered,  terrorism  and the 
faithful assistance of the  Greek Christians will indubitably and easily reduce, 

259 

Karl Marx 

beneath  the  scepter  of  Russia,  the  whole  of the  Archipelago,  the  coast  of 
Asia  Minor  and  all  Greece,  as  far  as  the  shore  of  the  Adriatic.  Then  the 
possession  of  these  countries,  so  much  favored  by  nature,  with  which  no 
other part of the world can be compared in respect to the fertility and richness 
of the  soil,  will  elevate  Russia to  a  degree  of  superiority  surpassing all the 
fabulous  wonders  which history  relates  of  the  grandeurs  of  the  monarchies 
of  ancient  times." 

5 

In  1774,  as  now,  Russia  was  tempting  the  ambition  of  Austria  with  the 
prospect  of  Bosnia,  Servia  and  Albania  being  incorporated  with  her.  The 
same  Baron  Thugut  writes  thus  on  this  subject:  "Such  aggrandizement  of  10 
the  Austrian  territory  would  not  excite  the  jealousy  of  Russia.  The reason 
is  that  the  requisition  which  Austria  would  make  of  Bosnia,  Servia,  etc., 
although  of  great  importance  under  other  circumstances,  would  not  be  of 
the  least utility to Russia, the moment the remainder of the Ottoman Empire 
should have fallen into her hands.  For these provinces are inhabited almost  15 
entirely  by  Mahommedans  and  Greek  Christians:  the  former  would  not be 
tolerated  as  residents  there;  the  latter,  considering the close vicinity of the 
Oriental  Russian  Empire  would  not  hesitate  to  emigrate  thither;  or  if  they 
remained,  their faithlessness to Austria would occasion continuous troubles; 
and  thus  an  extension  of  territory,  without  intrinsic  strength,  so  far  from  20 
augmenting the power  of the Emperor of Austria would only serve to weaken 
it." 

Politicians  are  wont to  refer to  the  testament of  Peter  I.,  in order to  show 
the traditional policy of Russia in general, and particularly with regard to her 
views on Constantinople. They might have gone back still further. More than 25 
eight  centuries  ago,  Swätoslaw,  the  yet  Pagan  Grand  Duke  of  Russia,  de 
clared  in  an assembly of his  Boyars, that  "not only Bulgaria, but the  Greek 
Empire  in  Europe,  together  with  Bohemia  and  Hungary,  ought  to  undergo 
the  rule  of  Russia."  Swätoslaw  conquered  Silistria  and  threatened  Con 
stantinople, A.D. 967, as Nicholas did in 1828. The Rurik dynasty transferred, 30 
soon  after  the  foundation  of  the  Russian Empire, their capital from  Nowgo 
rod to Kiew, in order to be nearer to Byzantium. In the eleventh century Kiew 
imitated  in  all  things  Constantinople,  and  was  called  the  second  Con 
stantinople,  thus  expressing  the  everlasting  aspirations  of  Russia.  The  re 
ligion  and  civilization  of  Russia  are  of  Byzantine  offspring,  and  that  she  35 
should have aimed at subduing the Byzantine Empire, then in the same decay 
as  the  Ottoman  Empire  is  now  in,  was  more  natural  than  that  the  German 
Emperors  should have  aimed  at the  conquest of  Rome  and Italy. The unity, 
then, in the  objects  of Russian policy,  is  given by her historical past, by her 
geographical  conditions,  and  by  her necessity  of gaining  open  sea-ports  in  40 
the  Archipelago  as  in  the  Baltic,  if  she wants  to maintain her  supremacy in 

260 

Financial  Failure  of Government—Cabs-Ireland—The  Russian  Question

Europe.  But  the  traditional  manner  in  which Russia pursues  those  objects, 
is  far from  meriting  that tribute  of  admiration paid  to  it by  European politi 
cians.  If  the  success  of  her  hereditary  policy  proves  the  weakness  of  the 
Western  Powers,  the  stereotyped  mannerism  of  that  policy  proves  the  in-
trinsic  barbarism  of  Russia  herself.  Who  would  not  laugh  at  the  idea  of 
French politics being conducted on the testament of Richelieu, or the capitu 
laries  of  Charlemagne?  Go  through  the  most  celebrated  documents  of 
Russian diplomacy, and you will find that shrewd, judicious, cunning,  subtle 
as  it  is  in  discovering  the  weak  points  of  European  Rings,  ministers  and 
10  courts,  its  wisdom  is  at  a  complete  dead-lock  as  often  as  the  historical 
movements of the Western peoples themselves are concerned. Prince Lieven 
judged  very  accurately  of  the  character  of  the  good  Aberdeen  when  he 
speculated  on his  connivance  with the  Czar,  but he  was  grossly mistaken in 
his  judgment  of  the  English  people  when  he  predicted  the  continuance  of 
15  Tory  rule  on  the  eve  of  the  Reform  move  of  1831.  Count Pozzo  di  Borgo 
judged  very  correctly  of  Charles  X., but  he  made  the  greatest blunder with 
regard  to  the  French  people  when  he  induced  his  "august  master"  to treat 
with  that  King  of  the  partition  of  Europe  on  the  eve  of  his  expulsion from 
France. The Russian policy, with its traditional craft, cheats and subterfuges, 
20  may impose upon the European Courts which are themselves but traditional 
things,  but it will prove utterly powerless with the revolutionized peoples. 

At  Beyrut,  the  Americans  have  abstracted  another  Hungarian  refugee 
from  the  claws  of  the  Austrian  eagle.  It  is  cheering  to  see  the  American 
intervention in Europe beginning just with the Eastern question. Besides the 
25  commercial  and  military  importance  resulting  from  the  situation  of  Con 
stantinople,  there  are  other historical considerations,  making its  possession 
the  hotly-controverted  and  permanent  subject  of  dispute  between the  East 
and the West—and America is the  youngest but most vigorous representative 
of  the  West. 

30 

35 

Constantinople is the eternal city—the Rome of the East. Under the ancient 
Greek Emperors, Western civilization amalgamated there  so far with Eastern 
barbarism, and under the Turks, Eastern barbarism amalgamated so far with 
Western  civilization,  as  to  make  this  center  of  a  theocratical  Empire  the 
effectual  bar  against  European  progress.  When  the  Greek  Emperors  were 
turned  out by the  Sultans  of  Iconium,  the  genius  of the  ancient  Byzantine 
Empire  survived  this  change  of  dynasties,  and  if  the  Sultan  were  to  be 
supplanted  by  the  Czar,  the  Bas-Empire would be  restored to life  with  more 
demoralizing  influences  than  under  the  ancient  Emperors,  and  with  more 
aggressive  power  than  under  the  Sultan.  The  Czar  would  be for  Byzantine 
40  civilization  what  Russian  adventurers  were  for  centuries  to  the  Emperors 
of  the  Lower  Empire—the  corps  de  garde  of  their  soldiers.  The  struggle 

261 

Karl Marx 

between Western Europe  and Russia about the possession of Constantinople 
involves the question whether Byzantinism is to fall before Western civiliza 
tion, or whether its  antagonism  shall revive in amore terrible and conquering 
form than ever  before.  Constantinople  is  the golden  bridge thrown between 
the  West  and  the  East,  and  Western  civilization  cannot,  like  the  sun,  go 
around  the  world  without  passing  that bridge;  and it cannot pass  it  without 
a  struggle with Russia.  The  Sultan holds Constantinople only in trust for the 
revolution,  and  the  present  nominal  dignitaries  of  Western  Europe,  them 
selves finding the last stronghold of their  "order" on the  shores of the Neva, 
can  do  nothing but  keep  the  question  in  suspense  until  Russia has  to  meet 
her  real  antagonist,  the  Revolution.  The  Revolution  which  will  break  the 
Rome  of the West will also overpower the demoniac influences of the Rome 
of  the  East. 

Those  of  your readers who, having read my letters on German Revolution 
and Counter-Revolution, written for  The  Tribune some two years ago, desire 
to  have  an  immediate  intuition  of  it,  will  do  well  to  inspect  the  picture  by 
Mr.  Hasenclever,  now  being  exhibited  in  the  New-York  Crystal  Palace, 
representing  the  presentation of  a workingmen's  petition to  the  magistrates 
of  Düsseldorf  in  1848.  What  the  writer  could  only  analyze,  the  eminent 
painter  has  reproduced  in  its  dramatic  vitality.

London  has  ceased  to  be  cabless.  Cabby parted with his  system of passive 
resistance  on  Saturday  last.  Meanwhile Parliament continues to break down 
its  great act of the  session, removing step by  step every casus òe/ù'between

The  India bill has passed  on Friday through its last stage, after the ministe 
rial  propositions for raising the  Directors'  and Chairmen's  salaries had been 
rejected,  and the latter reduced to £500 and £1,000 respectively. The Special 
10  Court  of  East  India  Proprietors  which  met  on  Friday  last,  offered  a  most 
lugubrious  spectacle,  the  desponding  cries  and  speeches  clearly  betraying 
the  apprehensions  of  the  worthy  proprietors,  that the Indian Empire  might 
have  been their  property  for  the  better time.  One right honorable gentleman 
gave  notice  of  his  intention  to  move resolutions in the House of Commons 
rejecting  the  present  bill,  and  on  the  part  of  the  proprietors  and Directors 
declining  to  accept the  part  assigned to  them by the  Ministerial  measure.  A 
strike  of  the  honorable  East India Proprietors  and Directors. Very  striking, 
indeed!  The Abolition of the  Company's Salt-monopoly by the British House 
of  Commons  was  the  first  step  to  bringing  the  finances  of  India  under  its 

15

The  Naval  Coast-Volunteers'  bill  passed  through  Committee  in  yester 
day's  sitting.  The  object  of  this  measure  is  to  form  a body  of  10,000  men, 
to  be trained during four weeks annually for the defense of the British Coasts. 
They  are  to receive a bounty of £6, as in the case of the militia. Their service 
is  to  be limited to five years in times of peace, and to  six in time of danger. 
When called out, they will receive the pay of able seamen, with an additional 
two-pence  per  day  during  the  last  year.  The  men  are  not  to  be taken more 
than  fifty  leagues  from  the  coasts  in  time  of  peace,  and  100  in  time  of 
danger.

The  Irish  Landlords'  and  Tenants'  bill  likewise  passed  through  the  third 
reading yesterday  night.  One  important  amendment  in favor  of  the  Tenants 
was  added,  viz.:  the  prohibition  of  Landlords  to  seize  and  sell the  standing 
crops  of  a  Tenant. 

Mr. Cobden has published a pamphlet on the origin of the Burmese war. 
So great are the fears  of a deficient harvest in France, that the Government 
of  Louis  Bonaparte  has  treated  with  the  Syndicate  of  the  Paris  bakers  for 
a  slight  reduction  in  the  prices  of  bread  during  the  first  half  of  August, 
notwithstanding the steady rise in flour at the Halle aux blés. The bakers are 
to be mdernnified by a subsequent augmentation of prices.  "This,"  says  The  10 
Economist,  "is  a  conspiracy  on  the  part  of the  French Government to  cheat 
the  people  into  a  belief  that  the  crops  are  not  short,  when  they  are."

Day  after  day  the  columns  of  the  Press  are  inundated  with  conflicting 
dispatches  on the Eastern affairs,  manufactured in Vienna and  Berlin, partly 
by  Russian  agents,  in  order  to  deceive  the  French  and  British public  as  to  15 
the  operations  of Russia,  and partly on orders  sent expressly from Paris, for 
stockjobbing  purposes.  A  declaration  contained  in  to-day's  Morning Post 
would  command  consideration  were  it  not that the Palmerstonian organ had 
quite  abused  such  threats,  which  it  only proffered one  day in order to  take 
them in again the  day  after. 

20 

"By  the  10th  of  August  the  whole  matter  will  be  terminated  peaceably, 
or  the  combined  fleets  will  be  commanded to  proceed to  the  Bosphorus,  or 
perhaps  to  the  Black  Sea.  Active  measures will  succeed patient negotiation, 
and the threat of  danger  will no  longer prevent the  strong means which may 
ensure safety. If the Czar accepts the proposal now made, the first condition  25 
will  be  the  immediate  evacuation  of  the  Principalities." 

The  Morning Post then  asserts,  that on the  24th  ult.  the  representatives 
of  England,  France,  Austria  and  Prussia  convened  on  the  terms  of  an  ulti 
matum  immediately  forwarded  to  St.  Petersburg.  This  assertion,  however, 
is  contradictory  to  the  late  declaration  of  Lord  Clarendon  and  Lord  John  30 
Russell,  who  spoke  only of  a joint note  of  France  and England,  and is  alto 
gether ignored by the French press. Yet, be this as it may, it indicates at least, 
that  the  Palmerston  party  in  the  Cabinet  has  handed  an  ultimatum  to  the 
good  Aberdeen,  which  the  latter  is  to  answer  on the  10th of August. 

As  though  we  had  not  yet  enough  of  conferences  at  Vienna  and  Con-  35 

stantinople,  we learn from the  National Zeitung, that other conferences  are 
now to  sit at Berlin too. The Emperor of Russia, to provide these conferences 
with the required "stuff" has complacently declared, that, with all his willing 
ness, to renounce the occupation of the Principalities as the material guaranty 
for  his  religious  associations,  he  would  now  be  obliged  to  hold  them  as  a  40 
guaranty for the  indemnification for his present expenses of occupying them.

In  the  Commons—The  Press  on  the  Eastern  Question—The  Czar's  Manifesto—Denmark 

While  Prince  Gortschakoff  announced  in  his  proclamations  that  Russia 
pledged  herself  to  abstain  from  all  interference  with  the  constituted  au 
thorities of the Principalities, the Czar issues  a decree forbidding the Hospo-
dars  of  Moldavia  and  Wallachia  to  pay  any  tribute  to,  or  to  hold any com-
5  munication  with,  the  Government  of  Turkey.  In  consequence  of  this  noti 
fication the  Hospodar  of  Wallachia informed  the  Russian  Consul  at Bucha 
rest,  that  he  had  already  sent  his  tribute  money to  the  Sultan,  to  which the 
Consul replied: c'est de l'argent perdu, as the Hospodar would have to pay 
it  again  to  Russia. 

10 

The  Patrie  of  yesterday  communicates  the  fact  that  three  of  the  most 
influential  Boyars  of  Moldavia had  left Jassy for Petersburg,  with the espe 
cial  consent  of  the  Hospodar,  in  order  to  remonstrate with the  Czar  on the 
conduct  of  the  Russian  soldiers,  who,  in  violation  of  the  solemn  promise 
given to  the  Porte,  treated  the  Danubian Provinces  as  a  conquered country, 
15  and  committed  numberless  extortions  therein.  The  Russians  can certainly 
not be accused of seeking to make propaganda by making themselves popular 
in  the  Principalities. 

Russia  continues  its  armaments  with the  same  ostentation  as  before.  The 
Hamburger Nachrichten publishes  the  following  Imperial manifesto,  dated 

20  Petersburg,  23d July:  "By  the  Grace  of  God, we, Nicholas  I., by our mani 

festo  of  August  1st,  (13th)  1834,  have  ordered  that  every  year  levies  shall 
take  place  in  certain  parts  of  our  empire:  to-day  we  order: 

1. For  completing  our  forces,  maritime  as  well  as  land,  the  tenth  partial 
recrutement  shall  take  place  in  the  Eastern  part  of  our  Empire,  at  the  rate 
25  of 7 men in every 1,000, the same as the recruitment which took place in 1852 

in  the  Western  portion  of  the  Empire. 

2.  Besides,  a  levy  of  3  in  every  1,000  shall  take  place  in  the  Eastern 
Provinces  of  our  Empire  as  completing  the  proportion  of  6  in  every  1,000, 
of  which  only  one  half  had  been  levied  by  the  previous  recruitment. 

30 

3.  To  the  Districts  of  Pskow,  Vitebsk,  and  Mohilew,  which  had  been 
exempted  in  virtue  of  our  manifesto  of  31st  Oct.,  1845,  and  of  26th  Sept., 
1846,  on  account  of  the  bad  harvest,  the  recruitment for  1853  shall be pro 
ceeded  with  at  the  rate  of  3  in  every  1,000.  With  regard  to  the  Jews  in the 
Districts  of  Vitebsk  and  Mohilew,  the  recruitment  among  them  shall  take 

35  place  the  same  as  in the  other  Districts,  at the  rate  of  10 in  every  1,000. 

4.  The  levy  shall  begin  on  1st  November  and  be  completed  on  1st  De 

cember. 

Given  at  St.  Petersburgh. 
The manifesto is followed by two ukases, regulating the details of this new 
40  and  extraordinary  levy.  Beside  the  above-mentioned  districts,  there  shall 
take place,  according to a third ukase, a recruitment among the odnodworzes

The  Hamburger  Correspondent reports  as  follows: 
"The  armaments  in  the  interior  of  the  Empire  continue  without  inter 
ruption.  The  reserve  battalions  of  the  4th  infantry  corps  are  being  con- 
centrated  near  Tula.  We  learn from  an order  of  the  day that the  guards  and 
grenadiers  still  occupy  their positions in the camps  near  Krasnoe  Selo,  and 
near Pudosh,  not far from  Gatshina. The field maneuvers  of these two corps, 
amounting  to  100,000  men,  continue."

The Post Zeitung of Stockholm,  of July  16, announces that the Emperor  10 

of  Russia had given orders  for the  arming  and fitting out of  the  Baltic  fleet, 
composed of 20 vessels of the line, and of 15 frigates. The Kölnische Zeitung 
of  29th July,  states: 

"The  return  of  the  Danish-Swedish  fleet  before  the  term  fixed  for  its 
evolutions  has  taken  place,  in  consequence  of  an  order  received  by  the  15 
commander  to  immediately  repair  to  the  Baltic." 

Both the  French journals  and  The Morning Chronicle, of to-day, contain 
a telegraphic  dispatch from Vienna of the  30th of  July,  stating that America 
had  offered  the  Porte  money  and  active  assistance. 

The  impression  produced  on  the  Continental  mind,  by  the  threatening  20 

attitude  of  Russia,  combined  with the  threatening prospect of the  harvests, 
is  most  significantly  reflected  in  the  following  words  of  The  Economist: 

"The  Czar  has  awakened  into  life  and  hope  the  revolutionary  spirit  of 
Europe,  and  we  read of plots  in Austria, plots  in Italy,  and plots  in France; 
and  there  begins  to  be  more  alarm  lest there  should be fresh revolutionary  25 
disturbances  than  that  governments  should  go  to  war."

forms  me  that  the  Royal  message  concerning  the  succession  was  chiefly 
carried  through the  abstention from  voting  of  a great  number of Eydermen, 
who  had  hoped  to  avoid  a  crisis  by  their  passive  attitude.  The  crisis which 
they  apprehended,  however,  has  come  upon  them  in  the  shape  of  the 
octroyed  Constitution,  and that Constitution is  aimed especially against the  35 
"peasant's  friends"-party by  whose  support the Danish Crown has  achieved 
its  previous  triumphs  in  the  succession  question.  As  I  propose  to  recur  to 
this  subject  in  a  special  letter,  I  will  merely  observe  here,  that  the  Danish 
government  has  laid  before  the  United  Diet,  (the  Landthing  and  the 
Volksthing  together)  the  notes  exchanged  with  the  Great  Powers  on  the  40 
subject  of  its  propositions.

In the Commons—The Press on the Eastern Question—The Czar's Manifesto—Denmark 

Of  these  documents  the  most  interesting  pieces  are  especially  at  this 
moment, the note of England and the note of Russia. The "silent" Clarendon 
not  only  approves  of  the  Royal  Message,  but distinctly hints to  the Danish 
Government  that  it  could  not  go  on  with  the  old  Democratic  Constitution, 
5  with Universal  Suffrage,  and with no  House of Lords. The silent Clarendon 
therefore  has  taken the initiative,  for the  interests  of Russia, to recommend 
and  provoke  the  Danish  coup  d'état.  The  Russian note, addressed by Count 
Nessekode  to  Baron  Ungern-Sternberg,  after  having  reviewed  the  articles 
of  the  Treaty  of  London,  dated  8th  of  May,  1852,  concludes  as  follows:

"The  treaty  of  the  8th  of  May  does  not formally  prescribe  that the  Lex 
Regia  should  be  canceled;  because  such  a disposition would  not have been 
opportune  in  a treaty  concluded between independent States. It would have 
been  contrary  to  diplomatic  usage,  and  still  more  to  the  respect  due  to  the 
sovereign  dignity  of the  Danish crown.  But the Powers in giving their assent 
to  a  retrocession  destined  to  supplant  the  arrangements  of  the  Lex  Regia, 
where the necessity of employing it would occur, in promising their support, 
have  naturally  been  obliged  to  leave  to  his  Majesty  the  King  of  Denmark 
the  choice  of  the  means  adequate  toward  realizing  the  object  by  way  of 
legislating. His majesty, by making use of his royal prerogative, has manif est-
ed  his  intention  of  establishing  an  order  of  succession,  for  all  the  States 
subject to his rule, by which, in case of the male descendants of Frederic III. 
becoming extinct,  all claims  arising from articles  27 and 40 of the Lex Regia 
should  be  excluded,  and  Prince  Christian  of  Glücksburg  called  upon  the 
throne  with  a  view  of  securing  the  Danish  crown to  him  and his  male  de-
scendants  by  his  marriage  with  Princess  Louisa  of  Hesse.  Such  are  the 
stipulations of the Royal Message of October4,1852. They express the views 
which,  at  least  on  the  part  of the  Imperial  Government,  have  served as  the 
foundation of the  present negotiations.  They form in the eyes of the Imperial 
Cabinet,  a  whole  and  cannot  be  retrenched;  for,  it  appears  to  us  that the 
abrogation of Articles 27 and 40 of the Lex Regia is a necessary consequence 
and  a  condition  sine qua non not only of the  stipulations which called Prince 
Christian  of  Glücksburg  and  his  descendants  to  the  throne,  but  also  of the 
principle  established  in  the  preambulum  of the treaty; that a contingency by 
which the male descendants should be called to the succession of the throne, 
in  the  totality  of  the  States  now  subjected  to  the  sovereignty of Denmark, 
was  the  safest  means  for  securing  the  integrity  of that  monarchy 
They 
declare  in article  Π.  of  the treaty that they recognize in a permanent manner 
the principle of the integrity of the Danish monarchy... They have promptly 
made  known  their  intention  of  preventing,  combinedly,  the  return  of  the 
40  complications  which  have  signaled  in  so  unfortunate  a  manner the  course 
of  the  last  year  . ..  The  extinction  of  the  male  line  of  Prince  Christian  de

Glücksburg  would  revive,  without  contradiction,  the  eventual claims  which 
His  Majesty  the  Emperor  has  renounced  in  favor  of  that  Prince.  The  in 
itiative,  however,  expressly  reserved to  the King of Denmark, as well as the 
cooperation of  the three  Great Powers, in the aforesaid contingencies, when 
they  shall  happen,  offer  henceforth  a  guarantee  to  the  Danish  patriots  against  5 
the  ambitious  plans  and  designs existing nowhere except in their own imagi 
nation." 

Thus  Russia  gives  to  understand,  that  the  temporary  suppression  of  the 
Lex  Regia as agreed upon in the protocol of the 8th May must be interpreted 
as a permanent one, that the permanent resignation of the Emperor of Russia 1 o 
is  only  a temporary  one,  but that the Danish patriots may henceforth repose 
on  the  protection  of  their  country's  integrity  by  the  European  Powers.  Do 
they  not  witness  how  the  integrity  of  Turkey  has  been  protected  since the 
treaty  of  1841?

London, Friday, Aug.  5,  1853. 

5  The  act for the repeal of  the Advertisement Duty received the Royal assent 
last night,  and comes into  operation this  day.  Several of the morning papers 
have  already published their reduced terms for advertisements of all kinds. 

The  dock-laborers  of  London  are  on  the  strike.  The  Company  endeavor 

to  get fresh men.  A battle between the old and new hands is  apprehended.

10  The  Emperor  of  Russia  has  discovered  new  reasons  for  holding  the  Princi 
palities.  He will hold them no longer as a material guarantee for his  spiritual 
aspirations,  or  as  an indemnity for the costs of occupying them, but he must 
hold  them  now  on  account  of  "internal  disturbances"  as  provided  by  the 
Treaty  of  Balta-Liman.  And,  as  the  Russians  have  actually  put  everything 
in the  Principalities  topsy-turvy,  the existence of  such disturbances  cannot 
be  denied.  Lord  Clarendon  confirmed,  in the  sitting  of  the  House  of  Lords 
of  August 2d,  the  statement given in my last letter with regard to the Hospo-
dars  having  been  prohibited  from  transmitting  their  tribute  to  Con 
stantinople,  and  from  entertaining  further  communications  with  Turkey. 
20  Lord  Clarendon declared with great gravity of countenance, and a pompous 
solemnity  of manner,  that he would  "instruct,  by  the messenger who leaves 
London  this  night,  Sir  Hamilton  Seymour  to  demand  from  the  Russian 
Cabinet  the  explanation  which  England  is  entitled  to."  While  Clarendon 
sends  all the  way  to  St.  Petersburg to  request  explanations,  the  Patrie of 
to-day  has  intelligence  from  Jassy of the 20th ultimo, that the Russians  are 
fortifying Bucharest  and Jassy;  that the  Hospodars  of  Moldavia  and Walla 
chia  are  placed  under  a Russian Board  of  Control  composed  of  three  mem-

bers;  that  contributions  in  kind  are  levied  on  the  people,  and  that  some 
refractory Boyards have been incorporated in Russian regiments.  This is the 
"explanation"  of  the  manifesto  of  Prince  Gortschakoff,  according  to  which 
"his  august  master  had  no  intention  of  modifying  the  institutions  which 
governed  the  country,  and  the  presence  of  his  troops  would  impose  upon 
the people neither new contributions nor charges." In the sitting of the House 
of  Commons  of  the  same  day  Lord  John  Russell  declared,  in  answer  to  a 
question  put  by  Lord  Dudley  Stuart,  that the  four powers  had  convened  at 
Vienna  on  a  common  proposition  to  be  made  to  the  Czar,  "acceptable"  to 
Russia and to Turkey,  and that it had been forwarded to St. Petersburgh. In  10 
answer  to  Mr.  Disraeli  he  stated:  "The  proposition was  in fact  an Austrian 
proposition,  though it came  originally from the Government of France. " This 
original  Frenchman,  naturalized  in  Austria,  looks very  suspicious,  and  The 
Neue Preussische Zeiiunggives, in a Vienna letter, the explanation that "the 
Russian  and  Austrian Cabinets  have fully resolved in common not to  allow  15 
English  influence  to  predominate  in  the  East."  The  Englishman  observes, 
on the  explanations of the  coaUtion-ministry:  "They  are great in humiliation, 
strong  in  imbecility,  and  most  eloquent  in  taciturnity." 

Moldavia  and  Wallachia  once  Russified,  Gallicia,  Hungary  and  Transyl 

vania would be  transformed into  Russian  "enclaves. " 

20 

I  have  spoken in a former letter of the  "hidden treasures"  in the  Bank of 
St.  Petersburg,  forming  the  metal  reserve  for  a  three  times  larger  paper 
circulation.  Now, the Russian Minister of War has just applied for the trans 
fer  of  a  portion  of  this  treasure  into  the  military  chest.  The  Minister  of 
Finance having objected to this step, the Emperor applied himself to the Holy 
Synod,  the  depository  of  the  Church-Property,  for  a loan  of  60 millions of 
rubles. While the  Czar is wanting in wealth, his troops are wanting in health. 
It is stated on very reliable authority, that the troops occupying the Principali 
ties  have  suffered  enormously  from  heat  on  their  march,  that  the  number 
of sick is extraordinary, and that many private houses at Bucharest and Jassy  30 
have  been  converted  into  hospitals. 

25 

The  Times  of  yesterday  denounced  the  ambitious  plans  of  Russia  on 
Turkey, but tried, at the  same time, to cover her intrigues in Denmark. It does 
the  work  of  its  august  master  even  while  ostentatiously  quarreling  with 
him. 

35 

"We  discredit,"  says  The  Times,  "the  assertion  that the  Russian  Cabinet 
has  succeeded  in  estabhshing  its  hold  upon  the  Court  of  Copenhagen,  and 
the  statement  that  the  Danish  Government have  proceeded,  under  Russian 
influence,  to  abrogate  or  impair  the  Constitution  of  1849,  is  wholly  inac 
curate.  The  Danish  Government have  caused  a bill or draft to be published  40 
containing  some modifications  of the  Constitution now in force, but this bill 

270 

Advertisement  Duty—Russian  Movements—Denmark—The  United  States  in  Europe 

is  to  be  submitted  to  the  discussion  and  vote  of  the  Chambers  when  they 
reassemble,  and  it  has  not  been  promulgated  by  Royal  authority." 

5 

The dissolution of a Legislative Assembly into four separate feudal provin 
cial  diets,  the  right  of  self-assessment  canceled,  the  election  by  universal 
suffrage  suppressed,  the  liberty  of  the  press  abolished,  free  competition 
supplanted  by  the  revival  of  close  guilds,  the  whole  official,  i.e.  the  only 
intelligent  class  in  Denmark  excluded  from  being  eligible  except  on  Royal 
permission,  that you  call "some  modifications of the Constitution?" As  well 
you  might  call  Slavery  a  slight  modification  of  Freedom.  It  is  true that the 
10  Danish King has not dared to promulgate this new "fundamental law" as law. 
He  has  only  sent,  after  the  fashion  of  Oriental  Sultans,  the  silken  string to 
the  Chambers  with  orders  to  strangle  themselves.  Such  a  proposition  in 
volves  the  threat of  inforcing it if  not voluntarily  submitted  to.  So much for 
the  "some  modifications  of  the  Constitution."  Now  to  the  "Russian  in-
fluence." 

15 

In  what  way  did  the  conflict  between  the  Danish  King  and  the  Danish 
Chambers  arise?  He  proposed  to  abrogate the  Lex Regia, viz:  The  existing 
law  of  succession  to  the  throne  of  Denmark.  Who  urged  the  King  to  take 
this  step? Russia,  as you will have  seen from the note of Count Nesselrode, 
20  dated  11th May,  1853, communicated in my last letter. Who will gain by that 
abrogation of the  Lex  Regia? No one but Russia.  The Lex Regia enables the 
female  line  of  the reigning family to  succeed to the throne. By its abrogation 
the  agnates would remove from the  succession all the claims of the cognates 
hitherto  standing  in  their  way.  You  know  that  the  kingdom  of  Denmark 
25  comprehends,  besides  Denmark Proper,  viz:  the Isles and Jutland,  also the 
two  Duchies  of  Schleswig  and  Holstein. The  succession to Denmark Proper 
and  Schleswig  is  regulated  by  the  same  Lex  Regia,  while  in  the  Duchy  of 
Holstein,  being  a  German  fief,  it  devolves  to  the  agnates,  according  to  the 
Lex  Salica.  By  the  abrogation of the  Lex Regia the  succession to  Denmark 
and Schleswig would be assimilated to that of the German Duchy of Holstein, 
and Russia,  having the  next claims  on Holstein,  as  the representative of the 
house  of  Holstein-Gottorp, would  in the  quality  of  chief  agnate,  also obtain 
the  next  claim  on  the  Danish throne.  In  1848—50,  Denmark,  being  assisted 
by Russian  notes  and  fleets,  made  over  to Germany in order to maintain the 
35  Lex  Regia,  which  forbade  Schleswig  to  be  united  with  Holstein,  and  to be 
separated from  Denmark.  After having beaten the German revolution, under 
the  pretext  of  the  Lex Regia,  the  Czar  confiscates  democratic  Denmark by 
abrogating  the  same  law.  The  Scandinavians  and  the  Germans  have  thus 
made the experience that they must not found their respective national claims 
40  on  the  feudal  laws  of  Royal  succession.  They  have  made  the  better  ex 

30 

perience, that,  by  quarrelling amongst themselves, instead of confederating, 

271 

Karl Marx 

Germans  and  Scandinavians,  both of them belonging to the  same great race, 
only  prepare  his  way  to  their  hereditary  enemy,  the  Sclave. 

The  great  event  of  the  day  is  the  appearance  of  American  policy  on  the 
European  horizon.  Saluted  by  one  party,  detested  by  the  other,  the  fact  is 
admitted by  all.

"Austria  must  look  to  the  dismemberment  of  the  Turkish  Empire  for 
indemnification  for  the  loss  of  her  Italian  provinces—a  contingency  not 
rendered  less  likely by  the  quarrel  she  has  had  the  folly to bring on her with 
Uncle  Sam.  An  American  squadron  in  the  Adriatic  would  be  a very  pretty 
complication of  an Italian insurrection,  and we  may  all live  to  see  it, for the  10 
Anglo-Saxon  spirit  is  not  yet  dead  in  the  West." 

Thus  speaks  The Morning Herald,  the  old  organ  of  the  English  Aristoc­

racy. 

"The  Koszta affair,"  says  the  Paris Presse, "is far from being terminated. 
We  are  informed  that  the  Vienna  Cabinet  has  asked  from  the  Washington 
Cabinet  a reparation, which  it  may be  quite  sure  not to receive.  Meanwhile, 
Koszta  remains  under  the  safeguard  of  the  French  Consul." 

15 

"We  must  go  out  of  the  way  of  the  Yankee,  who  is  half  of  a  buccanier 
and  half  a  backwoodsman,  and  no  gentleman  at  all,"  whispers  the  Vienna 
Presse. 

20 

The  German  papers  grumble  about  the  secret  treaty  pretended  to  have 
been concluded between  the  United  States  and Turkey,  according to  which 
the  latter  would  receive  money  and  maritime  support,  and  the  former  the 
harbor  of  Enos  in  Rumelia,  which  would afford a  sure  and convenient place 
for  a  commercial  and  military  station  of  the  American  Republic  in  the  25 
Mediterranean. 

" In  due  course  of  time,"  says  the  Brussels  Emancipation,  " t he  conflict 
at  Smyrna between the American Government and the Austrian one, caused 
by  the  capture  of  the  refugee  Kosta,  will  be  placed in the  first line  of events 
of  1853. Compared with this fact, the occupation of the Danubian PrincipaU-  30 
ties  and the movements of the western diplomacy and of the combined navies 
at  Constantinople,  may  be  considered  as  of  second-rate  importance.  The 
event  of  Smyrna  is  the  beginning  of  a  new  history,  while  the  accident  at 
Constantinople  is  only  the  unraveling  of an old question about to expire." 

An  Italian paper,  Π Parlamento,  has  a leader  under  the  title  " La Politica  35 

Americana  in  Europa,"  from  which  I  translate  the  following  passages  liter­
ally: 

" It  is  well known,"  says the Parlamento,  "that along time  has  elapsed  since 
the  United  States  have  tried  to get a maritime  station in the  Mediterranean 
and  in Italy,  and more particularly at such epochs when complications arose  40 
in  the  Orient.  Thus  for  instance  in  1840,  when  the  great  Egyptian  question 

272 

Advertisement  Duty—Russian  Movements-Denmark—The  United  States  in  Europe 

5 

15 

was  agitated,  and  when St. Jean d'Acre was assailed, the Government of the 
United  States  asked in vain from the  King of the Two Sicilies to temporarily 
grant it the great harbor of Syracuse. To-day the tendency of American policy 
for  interfering  with  European  affairs  cannot  be  but  more  lively  and  more 
steadfast.  There  can  be  no  doubt  but  that  the  actual  Democratic  Ad 
ministration of the Union manifests the  most clamorous  sympathies with the 
victims  of  the  Italian  and  Hungarian revolution, that it cares  nothing  about 
an  interruption  of  the  diplomatica!  intercourse  with  Austria,  and  that  at 
Smyrna  it  has  supported  its  system  with the threat of the  cannon.  It would 
10  be  unjust  to  grumble  at  this  aspiration  of the  great transatlantic  nation,  or 
to  call  it  inconsistent  or  ridiculous.  The  Americans  certainly  do  not intend 
conquering  the  Orient  and  going  to  have  a  land  war  with  Russia,  But  if 
England  and  France  make  the best of  their maritime forces, why should not 
the Americans do  so, particularly as soon as they will have obtained a station, 
a point of retreat and of 'approvisionnement' in the Mediterranean? For them 
there  are  great interests  at  stake, the republican element being diametrically 
opposed  to  the  Cossack  one.  Commerce  and  navigation  having multiplied 
the  legitimate  relations  and contracts between all peoples of the world, none 
can  consider  itself  a  stranger  to  any  sea of  the  Old  or New  Continent, or to 
20  any  great  question  like  that  of  the  destiny  of  the  Ottoman  Empire.  The 
American commerce,  and  the  residents who  exercise  it on the  shores of our 
seas,  require  the  protection  of  the  stars  and  stripes,  and  in  order  to  make 
it  permanent  and  valid  in  all  seasons  of  the  year,  they  want  a  port  for  a 
military  marine  that  ranks  already  in  the  third  line  among  the  maritime 
25  powers  of  the  world.  If  England  and  France  interfere  directly with all that 
regards  the  Isthmus  of  Panama,  if  the  former  of  those  powers  goes  as  far 
as  to  invent  a  king  of  the  Mosquitoes,  in  order  to  oppose  territorial  rights 
to  the  operations  of  the  United  States,  if they  have  come to the final under 
standing,  that  the  passage  from  the  Atlantic  to  the  Pacific  shall  be  opened 
to all nations, and be possessed by a neutral State, is it not evident then, that 
the  United  States  must pretend  at  exercising the  same vigilance with regard 
to the liberty and neutrality of the Isthmus of Suez, holding their eyes closely 
fixed  on  the  dissolution  of  the  Ottoman  Empire,  which  will  be  likely  to 
devolve  Egypt and  Syria wholly  or partly  to the dominion of some first-rate 
35  power?  Suez and Panama are the two great doorways of the Orient, which, 
shut till now, will hereafter compete with each other. The best way to  secure 
their ascendency in the Transatlantic question is to cooperate in the Mediter 
ranean question.  We are assured that the American men-of-war in the neigh 
borhood  of  the  Dardanelles  do  not  renounce  the  pretension  to  enter  them 
40  whenever they please,  without being  subjected to the restrictions convened 
upon  by  the  Great Powers  in  1841,  and this  for the  incontrovertible reason,

that  the  American  Government  did  not  participate  in  that  Convention. 
Europe  is  amazed  at this  boldness,  because  it has  been,  since the peace of 
1783, in the habit of considering the  United  States  as in the condition of the 
Swiss  Cantons  after the Westphalian treaty, viz: as peoples allowed a legiti 
mate  existence,  but  which  it  would  be  too  arduous  to  ask  to  enter into the 
aristocracy  of  the  primitive  Powers,  and  to  give  their  votes  on  subjects  of 
general  policy.  But  on  the  other  side  of  the  Ocean  the  Anglo-Saxon  race 
sprung  up  to  the  most  exalted  degree  of  wealth,  civilization  and  power, 
cannot  any  longer  accept the  humble  position  assigned to  it in the past.  The 
pressure  exercised  by the  American Union on the Council  of Amphictyons  10 
of the Five Powers, till now the arbiters of the globe, is a new force that must 
contribute to the  downfall of the exclusive  system  established by the treaties 
of  Vienna.  Till  the  Republic  of  the  United  States  succeed  in  acquiring  a 
positive  right  and  an  official  seat  in  the  Congresses  arbitrating  on  general 
political questions, it exercises with an immense grandeur, and with a particu-  15 
lar  dignity  the  more  humane  action of  natural  rights  and  of  the  jus gentium. 
Its  banner covers  the  victims  of the civil wars  without distinction of parties, 
and  during  the  immense  conflagration  of  1848—49  the  hospitality  of  the 
American  Navy  never  submitted  to  any  humiliation  or  disgrace."

5  Bonaparte  compensates  the  French  Navy  for  their  humiliating position  in 
Besika  Bay  by  a  reduction  in  the  price  of  tobacco  to  the  sailors,  as  we  are 
informed  by to-day's Moniteur. He won his throne by sausages. Why should 
he  not try to  hold it by tobacco? At all events, the Eastern complication will 
have  produced  the  démonétisation  of  Louis  Bonaparte  in  the  eyes  of  the 
10  French peasants  and the  army.  They have  learned that the  loss  of liberty  at 
home is  not made up by a gain of glory abroad. The "Empire of all the glories" 
has  sunk  even  lower  than  the  "Cabinet  of  all  the  talents." 

From  the  Constantinople  journals  which  have  just  arrived,  we  learn that 
the  Sultan's  manifesto  to  his  subjects  appeared  on  the  1st  August, that the 
15  Russian  Consul  at  Adrianople  has  received  orders  from  St.  Petersburg to 
withdraw from Turkey, that the  other Russian Consuls expect similar orders, 
and that the  Constantinople papers have been prohibited in the Principalities. 
The  Impartial of  Smyrna,  of  Aug.  1,  has  the  following  communication  with 
regard  to  Persia: 

20 

25 

"The  Shah  of  Persia,  after  the  correspondence  exchanged  between  the 
Porte  and  the  Russian  Cabinet  on  the  occasion of  the  pending  dispute,  had 
been  communicated  to him on his request, has officially declared that all the 
right was on the  side of the Porte, and that in case of war, he will fairly  stand 
by  her.  This  news  had  made  a great impression on the Russian Ambassador 
at  Teheran,  who  is  said  to  prepare  for  demanding his  passports." 

The contents of the proposition made to Russia, and accepted by the Czar, 
according  to  the  mysterious  Petersburg  dispatch,  form  the  subject  of  con-

"On the 25th of July M.  de Meyendorff transmitted to  his Imperial master, 
not indeed the formal propositions,  (accepted at the Vienna Conference,) but 
an account of what had passed  at the  conference of the 24th 
We believe 
we  shall not be far wrong when we confidently affirm that the affair is settled 
in  such a manner  as  to  preserve  intact the independence  and integrity of the 
Ottoman  Empire.  The  mode  of  settlement  will  be  this:  Reschid  Pasha  will 
address  the  Count  Nesselrode  a  note,  in  which  he  will  inclose  the  firmans 
in which are  accorded to the Greek Christians,  subjects of the Sultan, more  10 
privileges than even Russia had asked for them.  He will say many civil things 
to  the Czar and assure him of the excellent disposition of the  Sultan towards 
his  own  subjects, to whom  he  has  accorded  such and  such rights.  This  note 
will  be  presented by  a Turkish  Ambassador,  and the affair will be at an end. 
. ..  By the  10th of  September  the last Russian soldier will have  crossed the  15 
Prath!" 

On  the other hand, private letters from Vienna, alluding to the appearance 
of  Russian  gun-boats  above  the  confluence  of  the  Pruth  and  the  Danube, 
confirm  the  statement  given  in  my  last letter,  that  the  propositions  sent  to 
St.  Petersburgh,  do  not include  at  all  the withdrawal of the Russian armies  20 
from  the  Principalities,  that  they  emanate  from  the  Austrian  Cabinet,  to 
whose  intervention  the  British  Ambassador  at  Vienna,  "that true  lover  of 
harmony,"  had  appealed,  after  the  French  and  English proposals  had been 
rejected  by  the  Czar;  and  that  they  afford  Russia  the  desired  opportunity 
for  prolonging  negotiations  in  infinitum.  According  to  the  semi-official  25 
Frankfort  Ober-Postamts-Zeitung,  Russia  has  only  permitted  Austria  to 
enlighten  Turkey  with  regard  to  her  own  interests. 

The  lately  published  Population  Returns  prove  the  slow  but  steady  de 

crease of the population of Great Britain. In the quarter ending June,  1853, 
the  number of deaths was

The  decrease  of  population,  resulting  from  emigration  coincides with an  40 

unprecedented  increase  in the  powers  of  production  and capital.  When we

remember  Parson  Malthus  denying  emigration  any  such  influence,  and 
imagining  he  had  established,  by  the  most  elaborate  calculations,  that the 
united  navies  of  the  world  could  never  suffice  for  an  emigration  of  such 
dimensions  as  were  likely  to  affect  in  any  way  the  overstocking  of human 
beings,  the whole mystery of modern political economy is  unraveled to  our 
eyes.  It consists  simply  in transforming transitory  social relations belonging 
to  a  determined  epoch  of  history  and  corresponding with  a  given  state  of 
material production, into eternal, general, never-changing laws, natural laws, 
as  they  call  them.  The  thorough  transformation  of  the  social  relations  re 
sulting from the revolutions and evolutions in the process of material produc 
tion,  is  viewed  by  the  political  economists  as  a  mere  Utopia.  They  see  the 
economical  limits  of  a given  epoch,  but  they  do  not understand  how these 
limits  are  limited  themselves,  and  must  disappear  through  the  working  of 
history,  as  they  have  been  created  by  it. 

The  accounts  relating to  Trade  and  Navigation for  the  six  months  ending 
July  5,  1853,  as  published  by  the  Board  of  Trade,  show in general  a great 
increase  when  compared  with  the  exports,  imports,  and  shipping  in  the 
corresponding  period  of  the  year  1852.  The  import  of  oxen,  bulls,  cows, 
calves,  sheep  and  lambs  has  considerably  increased.

With regard to the imports of manufactures, the greatest increase is found 
ih  shoes, boots  and gloves,  and the  greatest decrease in glass manufactures, 
watches,  woolen  stuffs,  and  Indian  silk  manufactures.  With  regard  to  ex 
ports,  the  increase  is  greatest  in linen,  silks, woolens  and metals.  As to the 
importations  of  articles  of  consumption,  we  find  that, with the exception of 
grains  and  cattle,  the  increase  in  nearly  all  articles  bears  witness  that  the

home  consumption of the higher and middle classes has advanced in a much 
larger  proportion than  that  of  the  working  classes.  While,  for instance, the 
consumption  of  wine  has  doubled,  the  consumption  of  cocoa,  unrefined 
sugar,  and  tea  has  decidedly  retrograded.

Out  of  260 reports  on  the  wheat  crops  throughout  the  United  Kingdom, 
only  25  speak  of the  crop  as  fine  and  abundant,  30  as  an  average one, and 
above  200 reports  declare  it to be bad and  deficient.  Oats, barley and beans 
are  expected  to  turn  out  less  unfavorable,  as  the  wet  has  benefitted  them; 
but  the  potatoes  are  blighted  in  all  parts  of  the  country.  Messrs.  J.  and 

10  C. Sturge  & C o.  remark,  in their  last  circular  on the  wheat  crop: 

"The  wheat  crop  on  the  aggregate  will  probably  be  the  least productive 
of any since  1816, and unless the harvest of 1854 is very early, we may require 
an  importation  of  all  kinds  of  grain  and  breadstuffs  greater  even  than  that 
of  1847—probably  not  less  than  15,000,000  quarters—but  our  present prices 
are  sufficient to induce imports to this extent, unless France should compete 
with  us  in  the  producing  markets." 

15 

As  to  a  very  early  crop  in  1854,  there  seems  to  be  no  great prospect  of 
that,  inasmuch  as  experience  has  shown that bad harvests  generally  follow 
in succession just as the good ones; and the succession of good harvests since 
20  1848  has  already been unusually long. That England will obtain a sufficient 
supply  of  corn  from  foreign  countries  is,  perhaps,  pretty  sure; but that the 
exportation of  her  manufactures  will, as Freetraders expect, keep pace with 
the  importations  of  grains,  cannot, be  presumed.  The  probable  excess  of 
importation  over  exportation  will,  besides,  be  accompanied by  a falling  off 
in the home  consumption of manufactures.  Even now the bullion reserve in 
the  Bank  of  England  is  decreasing  week  after  week,  and  has  sunk  to 
£17,739,107.

The  House  of  Lords  in  its  sitting of  Friday last rejected  the  Combination 
of  Workmen bill,  which had passed through the  Commons. This bill was but 
a  new  interpretation  of  the  old  Combination-Act  of  1825, and intended, by 
removing its  cumbrous and equivocal terminology^ to place the workingmen 
on  a more equal footing with their employers, as far as the legality of combi 
nation is concerned. The  sentimental lords who please themselves in treating 
the  workingmen  as  their  humble  clients,  feel  exasperated  whenever  that 
rabble  asks  for  rights  instead  of  sympathies.  The  so-called  Radical papers 
have,  of  course,  eagerly  seized  on  this  opportunity  to  denounce  the  Lords 
to  the  proletarians  as their  "hereditary  foes."  I  am far from  denying it.  But 
let us  now  look at these  Radicals, the  "natural friends" of the  workingmen. 
I  told  you  in  a  former  letter  that the  Manchester  master-spinners  and manu-
facturers  were  getting up  an  association for  resisting  the  demands  of  their 
"hands."  This  association  calls  itself  "an  association  for  the  purpose  of 

30 

35 

40 

279 

Karl Marx 

aiding  the  trade  in  regulating  the  excitement  among  the  operatives  in  the 
Manchester  district."  It  purports  to  have  been  formed  for  the  following 
purposes: 

" 1.  The  establishment  of  wages  for  various  operations  connected  with 
spinning and weaving, similar to those paid in the other districts of the cotton 
trade. 

5 

2. The  mutual  protection  of  its  members  in  the  payment  of  such  wages 
against the resistance offered to them on the part of the operatives employed 
by  them  respectively. 

3. The securing to the operatives themselves the advantage of a uniformity 
of  adequate  wages,  to  be  paid  to  them  throughout  town  and  neighbor 
hood." 

10 

In  order  to  effect  these  purposes  they  have  resolved  to  set  up  a  whole 
organization, by forming local associations  of master-spinners and manufac 
turers,  with  a  central  committee.  "They  will  resist  all  demands  made  by  15 
associated  bodies  of  mill-hands,  as  any  concession  to  them  would  be  in 
jurious  to  employers,  operatives,  and  the  trade  generally."  They  will  not 
allow the  machinery  set up  by  and  for themselves to be counterbalanced by 
a similar machinery  set up  by their men. They intend fortifying the monopoly 
of  capital  by  the  monopoly  of  combination.  They  will  dictate  terms  as  an  20 
associated body.  But the  laborers  shall  only  dispute them in their individual 
capacity.  They  will  attack  in  ranged  battle,  but  they  will  not  be  resisted, 
except  in  single  fight.  This  is  "fat  competition, "  as  understood  by  the 
Manchester  radicals  and  model  free  traders. 

In  its  sitting of  Aug.  9,  the  House  of  Lords  had  to  decide  on the  fate  of  25 

three  Ireland  Bills,  carried  through  the  Commons  after  ten  months  de 
liberation, viz: the Landlord and Tenant Bill, removing the laws concerning 
mortgages,  which  form  at  present  an  insuperable bar  to  the  effective  sale 
of  the  smaller  estates  not  falling  under  the  Encumbered  Estates  Act;  the 
Leasing Powers Bill,  amending  and  consolidating  more  than  sixty  acts of  30 
Parliament  which prohibit  leases  to  be  entered  into for 21  years, regulating 
the tenant's compensation for improvements in all instances where contracts 
exist,  and  preventing  the  system  of  sub-letting;  lastly,  the  Tenant's  Im 
provement  Compensation  Bill,  providing  compensation  for improvements 
effected by the tenant in the  absence  of any contract with the landlord, and  35 
containing  a  clause  for  the  retrospective  operation  of  this  provision.  The 
House  of  Lords  could,  of  course,  not  object  to  parliamentary  interference 
between  landlord  and tenant,  as  it  has  laden  the  statute book from the  time 
of  Edward  TV  to  the  present  day,  with  acts  of  legislation  on  landlord  and 
tenant,  and  as  its  very  existence  is  founded  on laws  meddling  with  landed  40 
property,  as  for  instance  the  law of Entail.  This  time,  the noble lords  sitting 

280 

The  War  Question—British  Population  and  Trade  Returns—Doings  of  Parliament 

10 

as  Judges  on their own cause, allowed themselves to run into a passion quite 
surprising  in  that  hospital  of  invalids.  "Such  a  bill,"  exclaimed  the  Earl  of 
Clanricarde,  "as  the Tenants'  Compensation Bill,  such a total violation and 
disregard  of  all  contracts,  was  never  before,  he  believed,  submitted  to 
5  Parliament,  nor  had  he  ever  heard  of  any  government  having  ventured  to 
propose  such  a  measure  as  was  carried  out  in  the  retrospective  clauses  of 
the bill. " The Lords went as far as to threaten the Crown with the withdrawal 
of their feudal allegiance, and to  hold out the prospect of  a landlord rebellion 
in  Ireland.  "The  question,"  remarked  the  same nobleman,  "touched nearly 
the  whole question of the loyalty and confidence of the landed proprietors 
in  Ireland  in  the  Government  of  this  country.  If  they  saw  landed  property 
in  Ireland  treated  in  such  a way,  he  would like  to  know  what was  to  secure 
their  attachment  to  the  Crown,  and  their  obedience  to  its  supremacy?" 
Gently, my lord, gently! What was to secure their obedience to the supremacy 
15  of  the  Crown?  One  magistrate  and  two  constables.  A  landlord  rebellion  in 
Great Britain!  Has  there  ever been  uttered amore monstrous  anachronism? 
But for a long time the poor Lords have only lived upon anachronisms. They 
naturally  encourage  themselves  to  resist the  House of Commons and public 
opinion.  "Let not their lordships,"  said old Lord St.  Leonards,  "for the  sake 
20  of  preventing  what  was  called  a  collision with  the  other  House,  or  for  the 
sake  of popularity, or on  account of a pressure from without, pass imperfect 
measures like  these."  "I do  not belong to  any party,"  exclaimed the  Earl of 
Roden,  "but I  am highly  interested in the welfare of Ireland." That is to  say, 
his  lordship  supposes  Ireland  to  be  highly  interested  in  the  welfare  of  the 
25  Earl  of  Roden.  "This  is  no  party  question, but a Lords'  question,"  was the 
unanimous shout of the House; and so it was. But between bothparties, Whig 
Lords  and  Tory  Lords,  Coalition  Lords  and  Opposition  Lords,  there  has 
existed  from  the  beginning a secret understanding to throw the bills  out, and 
the  whole  impassioned  discussion  was  a  mere  farce,  performed  for  the 

30  benefit  of  the  newspaper  reporters. 

35 

This  will  be  evident  when  we  remember  that  the  bills  which  formed  the 
subject  of  so hot a controversy were originated, not by the Coalition Cabinet, 
but by Mr. Napier, the Irish Attorney-General under the Derby Ministry, and 
that the  Tories  at  the  last  elections  in  Ireland  appealed to the testimony  of 
these  bills  introduced  by  them.  The  only  substantial  change  made  by  the 
House  of  Commons  in  the  measures  introduced  by  the  Tory  Government 
was  the  excluding  of  the  growing  crops  from  being  distrained  upon.  "The 
bills  are  not the  same,"  exclaimed the Earl of Malmesbury, asking the Duke 
of  Newcastle  whether  he  did  not  believe  him.  "Certainly  not,"  replied  the 
40 Duke. "But whose assertion would you then believe?" "That of Mr. Napier," 
answered  the  Duke.  "Now,"  said  the  Earl,  "here  is  a  letter  of Mr.  Napier, 

281 

Karl Marx 

stating that the bills  are not the  same."  "There,"  said the Duke,  "is  another 
letter  of  Mr.  Napier,  stating  that  they  are." 

If  the  Tories had remained in, the Coälition-lords would have opposed the 
Ireland  Bills.  The  Coalition being in,  on the Tories fell the task of opposing 
their  own  measures.  The  Coalition  having  inherited  these  bills  from  the 
Tories  and  having  introduced  the  Irish  party  into  their  own  cabinet,  could 
of course, not oppose the bills in the House of Commons ; but they were sure 
of  their  being burked in the House  of  Lords.  The Duke  of  Newcastle  made 
a  faint  resistance,  but  Lord  Aberdeen  declared  himself  contented  with  the 
bills  passing formally through a  second reading, and being really thrown out  10 
for  the  session. This accordingly was done.  Lord Derby, the chief of the late 
ministry,  and  Lord  Lansdowne,  the  nominal  President  of  the  present 
ministry, yet at the  same time one of the largest proprietors of land in Ireland, 
managed,  wisely,  to  be  absent  from  indisposition. 

5 

On the  same day the House of Commons carried the Hackney Carriages  15 

Duties  Bill through  the  third  reading,  renewing the  official price-regulations 
of  the  17th  century,  and  accepting  the  clause  proposed  by  Mr. F. Scully, 
which  subjects  cab proprietors'  strikes  to legal penalties.  We have  not now 
to  settle  the  question of  state  interference  with  private  concerns.  We  have 
only  to  state  that  this  passed  in  a free-trade  House.  But,  they  say,  that in  20 
the  cab  trade  there  exists  monopoly  and  not  free  competition.  This  is  a 
curious  sort  of  logic.  First they  subject  a  particular  trade  to  a  duty,  called 
license,  and  to  special  police regulations, and then they affirm that, in virtue 
of these  very burdens imposed upon it, the trade loses its free-trade character 
and becomes  transformed into  a  state  monopoly. 

25 

The  Transportation  Bill  has  also  passed  through  Committee.  Except  a 
small  number  of  convicts  who  will  continue  to  be  transported  to  Western 
Australia,  the  penalty  of  transportation  is  abolished  by  this  bill.  After  a 
certain period of preliminary imprisonment the  offenders will receive tickets 
of leave in Great Britain, liable to be revoked, and then they will be employed 30 
on the  public  works  at wages to be  determined by Government. The philan 
thropic  object  of  the  latter  clause  is  the  erection  of  an  artificial  surplus  in 
the  labor  market  by  drawing forced convict-labor into competition with free 
labor;  the  same  philanthropists  forbidding  the  workhouse  paupers  all  sort 
of productive labor from fear of creating competition with private capital. 

35 

The London Press, a weekly journal, inspired by Mr.  Disraeli, and certainly 
the  best informed paper as far as ministerial mysteries are concerned, made, 
on  Saturday  last,  and  accordingly  before  the  arrival  of  the  Petersburg  dis 
patch,  the  following  curious  statement: 

"We are informed, that in their private and confidential circles, the minis-  40 

ters  declare  that  there  is  not  only  now  no  danger  of war,  but that the  peril, 

282 

The  War  Question—British  Population  and  Trade  Returns—Doings  of  Parliament 

5 

if it ever existed, has long been averted. It seems that the proposition formally 
forwarded to St.  Petersburg,  had been previously  approved by the  Emperor; 
and while the British Government assume in public countenance a tone which 
is  exercising  a  deleterious  influence  on  the  trade  of  the  country, in private 
t h ey  treat  the  panic  as  a  hoax,  scoff  at  any  idea  of  war  having  ever  been 
seriously  contemplated  by  any  power,  and  speak  of  the  misunderstanding 
in  question  'as  a thing  that  has  been  settled  these  three weeks.' What does 
all  this  mean,  what  is  the  mystery  of  all this  conduct?  . ..  The propositions 
now  at St.  Petersburg, and which were  approved by the Emperor before they 
10 were transmitted to St. Petersburg, involve a complete concession by Turkey 
to  Russia  of  all  those  demands,  a  resistance  to  which  brought  about  the 
present  war  between these  two  countries.  Those  demands  were  resisted by 
the  Porte  under  the  counsel  and  at  the  special  instigation  of  England  and 
France.  By the advice  and  special instigation of England  and France, those 
15  demands,  according  to  this  project,  are  now  to  be  complied  with.  There  is 
some  change  of  form,  but  there  is  nothing  material  in  that  change.  The 
Emperor  of  Russia,  in virtually  establishing the Protectorate  over the  great 
bulk  of  the  population  of  European  Turkey,  is  to  declare,  that  in  so  doing 
he  has  no  wish  to  impugn the  sovereign rights  of  the  Sultan.  Magnanimous 

20  admission!" 

Royalty  in  Great  Britain  is  supposed  to  be  only  a  nominal  power,  an 
assumption which accounts for the peace all parties keep with it. If you were 
to  ask  a Radical why  his  party  abstained  from  attacking the  prerogatives  of 
the  Crown,  he  would  answer  you:  It  is  a  mere  State  decoration  which  we 
25  don't care  about. He would tell you that Queen Victoria has only once dared 
to  have  a  will  of  her  own,  at  the  time  of  the  famous  bed  chambermaid's 
catastrophe,  when  she  insisted  upon  retaining  her  female  Whig  entourage, 
but  was  forced  to  yield  to  Sir  Robert  Peel,  and  dismiss  it.  Various  circum 
stances,  however,  connected  with  the  Oriental  question—the  inexplicable 

30  policy  of  the  Ministry,  the  denunciations  of foreign journals,  and the  suc 
cessive  arrival of Russian princes and princesses, at a moment when England 
was  supposed to  be  on the  eve  of  a war  with the  Autocrat—have  accredited 
the  rumor  that there  existed,  during  the  whole  epoch  of the  Eastern crisis, 
a  Court  conspiracy  with  Russia,  sustaining  the good old Aberdeen in office, 
35  paralyzing  the  showy  alliance  with  France,  and  counteracting  the  official 
resistance  to  Russian encroachments.  The  Portuguese  counter revolution is 
hinted  at,  which  was  enforced  by  an  English  fleet,  for  the  sole  interest  of 
the  Coburg  family.  It  is  iterated  that  Lord  Palmerston,  too,  had  been  dis 
missed  from  the  Foreign  Office  in  consequence  of  Court  intrigues.  The 
40  notorious  friendship  between  the  Queen  and  the  Duchess  of  Orleans  is 
alluded  to.  It  is  remembered  that  the  Royal  Consort  is  a  Coburg,  that  the 

283 

Karl Marx 

Queen's  uncle  is  another Coburg, highly interested as  King of  Belgium  and 
as  the  son-in-law  of  Louis  Philippe,  in  the  fall  of  Bonaparte,  and  officially 
received into the circle of the Holy Alliance, by the marriage of his  son with 
an  Austrian  Archduchess.  Lastly,  the  reception  which  the  Russian guests 
meet with, is contrasted with the imprisonment and chicanery English travel- 
ers  lately  met  with  in  Russia. 

5 

The Paris  Siècle some weeks  ago denounced the English Court. A German 
paper dwelt on the  Coburg-Orleans  conspiracy, which, for the sake of family 
interests,  had,  through  the  medium  of  King  Leopold  and  Prince  Albert, 
enforced upon the English Ministry a Une of policy dangerous to the Western  10 
nations,  and  fostering  the  secret  intentions  of Russia.  The  Brussels  Nation 
had  a  long  report of  a  Cabinet  Council held  at  London,  in which the  Queen 
had formally declared that Bonaparte, by his pretensions to the Holy Shrines, 
had  been  the  only  cause  of  the  present complications, that the  Emperor of 
Russia wished  less  to  humiliate  Turkey than  his  French rival,  and that she  15 
would  never give  her Royal assent to any war against Russia for the interest 
of  a  Bonaparte. 

These  rumors  have been delicately alluded to by  The Morning Advertiser, 
and  have  found  a  loud echo  in the  public,  and a cautious  one in the  weekly 
press. 

20 

"Without  desiring,"  says  The  Leader,  "to  put constructions  too  wide,  let 
us  simply  observe  facts.  The  Princess  Olga  has  come  to  England  with  her 
husband,  and her  sister, the  Duchess of  Leuchtenberg, the  Emperor's most 
diplomatic  daughter.  She  has  been  received  by  Baron Brunnow,  and  she  is 
at  once  welcomed  at Court,  and  surrounded by the representatives  of good  25 
society  in  England,  Lord  Aberdeen  being  among  that  number."  Even  The 
Examiner,  the  first  of  the  first-rate  London  weekly  papers,  announces  the 
arrival  of  these  guests  under  the  laconic  rubric  "More Russians.  " In  one  of 
its leaders we find the remark,  "No earthly reason now exists why the Peace 
Society  should  not  reappear  before  the  world,  in  the  most  approved form,  30 
under the patronage of His Royal Highness, Prince Albert." A more direct 
allusion  is  not  allowable  in  a  journal  of  the  standing  of  The  Examiner.  It 
concludes  the  article  from  which  I  quote  by  contrasting  the  English 
Monarchy  with  the  Transatlantic  Republic:  "If  the  Americans  should  be 
ambitious to seize the place we once held in Europe, that is no affair of ours.  35 
Let them reap the present honor and ultimate  advantage of enforcing the law 
of  nations,  and  of  being  reverenced  as  the  protectors  of  the  feeble  against 
the  strong.  England is content, provided only Consols be at par, and her own 
coasts  secure  against  any  immediate  attack  of  a  foreign  army."

March,  1854, being proposed, Mr. Wise asked what had become of the £1,100 
a year,  voted for the last thirty years, in order to keep in repair the residence 
of  the  British Ambassador  at Paris.  Sir  William  Molesworth was  compelled 
to  own  that  the  public  money  had  been  misapplied,  and  that,  according  to 
the  architect  Albano,  sent  by  Government  to  Paris,  the  residence  of  the 
British  Ambassador  was  in  a  most  dilapidated  state.  The  verandah  around 
the  house  had  fallen  in;  the  walls  were  in  a  state  of  decay;  the  house  had 
not been painted for several years; the  staircases were unsafe; the cesspools 
were  exhaling  a  most  offensive  effluvium;  the  rooms  were  full  of  vermin, 
10  which were  nirming over the tables,  and maggots were in every place on the 
furniture  and  on the  curtains,  while  the  carpets  were  stained by the  dirt of 
dogs  and  cats.

in the  House  of  Lords. 

Correspondence  of  The  N.Y.Tribune. 

London, Tuesday,  August  16,  1853. 

David  Urquhart  has  published  four  letters  on  the  Oriental  question,  pur- 
porting  to  expose  four  delusions—firstly,  that  regarding  the  identity  of  the 
Oriental  and  Russian  Churches;  secondly,  of  there  being  a  diplomatica! 
contest  between England  and Russia; thirdly,  of there being  a possibility of 
war  between  England  and  Russia;  and  lastly,  the delusion of union between 
England  and  France.  As  I  intend  to  recur  another  time  more fully to these  10 
letters,  I  confine myself for the present to  communicating to you the follow 
ing  letter  addressed  by  Bern  to  Rechid  Pasha,  a letter  published for the first 
time  by  Mr.  Urquhart.

"Monseigneur!  Not  seeing  the  order  arrive  to  command  my  presence  at 
Constantinople, I conceive it to be my duty to address to your Highness some  15 
considerations  which  appear  to  me  to  be  urgent.  I  commence  by declaring 
that  the  Turkish  troops  which  I  have  seen,  cavalry,  infantry,  and  field 
artillery,  are  excellent.  In bearing, instruction, and military  spirit, there  can 
be  no  better. The horses  surpass those of any European cavalry.  That which 
is  inappreciable  is  the  desire  felt  by  all  the  officers  and  all  the  soldiers  to  20 
fight  against  Russia.  With  such  troops  I  would  willingly  engage to  attack a 
Russian force  double  their  number,  and  I  should  be  victorious.  And  as  the 
Ottoman  Empire  can  march  against  the  Russians  more  troops  than  that 
Power  can  oppose  to  them, it is  evident that the  Sultan may have  the  satis 
faction  to  see  restored  to  his  sceptre  all  the  Provinces  treacherously  25 
withdrawn  from  his  ancestors  by  the  Czars  of  Moscow  . ..  Bern." 

The  Austrian  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  has  sent  to  all  the  European 

286 

Urquhart—Bern—The  Turkish  Question  in  the  House  of  Lords 

Courts  a  note  relative  to  the  conduct  of  the  American  frigate  St.  Louis, in 
the  Koszta  affair,  denouncing the  American policy  in  general.  Austria con 
tends that  she  has the right to kidnap foreigners from the territory of a neutral 
power, while the United States have no right to commence hostilities in order 
to  defend them.

On  Friday,  in  the House of Lords, the Earl of Malmesbury did not inquire 
into the mystery of the Vienna Conference,  or of the propositions forwarded 
by  it  to  the  Czar,  nor  did  he  inquire  as  to the  present  state of transactions. 
His  curiosity  was  rather of a retrospective  and  antiquarian character.  What 
10  he moved for was  "simple translations" of the two manifestos addressed by 
the  Emperor,  in  May and June,  to  his  diplomatical agents,  and published in 
the  Sr.  Petersburg Gazette,  and  also  "for  any answer which Her Majesty's 
Government  might have  sent to the  statements therein contained." The Earl 
of  Malmesbury  is  no  ancient  Roman.  Nothing  could  be  more  repulsive  to 
15  his  feelings  than  the  Roman  manner  of  openly  examining  foreign  Am 
bassadors  amid  the  patres  conscripti.  The  two  Russian circulars  he  stated 
himself  to  "have  been  published  openly  to  all  Europe  by  the  Emperor  of 
Russia in his own language, and have also appeared in the English and French 
languages,  in the  public prints."  What possible good, then, could result from 
translating  them  again from  the  language  of  the writers  of the public prints 
into  the  language  of  the  clerks  of the  foreign  office?  "The  French  Govern 
ment  did  answer  the  circulars  immediately  and  ably  . ..  The  English reply, 
as  we  are  told,  was  made  soon  after  that of the  French  Government."  The 
Earl  of  Malmesbury  was  anxious  to  know  how  the  indifferent prose  of  M. 
25  Drouyn de l'Huys might look when translated into the noble prose of the Earl 

20 

of  Clarendon. 

He  felt  himself  bound  to  remind  "his  noble  friend  opposite,"  that  John 
Bull,  after  thirty  years  of  peace,  of  commercial  habits,  and  of  industrial 
pursuits,  had  become  "somewhat  nervous"  with regard to  war,  and that this 
30  nervosity had,  since the month of March last, "increased from the continued 
and  lengthened  mystery  which  the  Government  have  drawn  over  their 
operations  and  negotiations."  In  the  interest  of  peace,  therefore,  Lord 
Malmesbury  interpellates,  but in the  same interest of peace the Government 
keeps  silence. 

35 

The  first  signs  of  aggression  of  Russia on  European Turkey  no  one was 
more  annoyed  at than the  noble  Earl himself.  He  had never  suspected  such 
a  thing  as  Russian  designs  upon  Turkey.  He  would  not  believe  in what  he 
saw.  There  was  above  all "the honor of the Emperor of Russia." But did the 
aggrandizement of his Empire ever damage the honor of an Emperor? There 
40  was  "his  conservative  policy  which  he  had emphatically proved during the 
revolutions  of  1848."  Indeed,  the  Autocrat  did  not  join  in  the  wickedness 

287 

Karl  Marx 

of  those  revolutions.  Especially,  in  1852,  when  the  noble  Earl  held  the 
Foreign  office  "it  was  impossible  for  any  Sovereign to  give  more  repeated 
assurances,  or  to  show  a  more  sincere  interest  in  the  maintenance  of  the 
treaties  by  which  Europe  is  bound,  and  the  maintenance  of  the  territorial 
arrangements  which  have  existed  for the  happiness  of Europe for so  many 
years."  Certainly, when the Baron Brunnow induced the Earl of Malmesbury 
to sign the treaty of 8th May,  1852, with regard to the succession of the Danish 
throne,  he  caught him with repeated assurances as to the foible of his august 
master  for existing treaties; and when he persuaded him, at the time the Earl 
hailed the usurpation of Bonaparte, to enter into a secret alliance with Russia, 10 
Prussia,  and  Austria  against this  same  Bonaparte, he  made  a great  show  of 
his  sincere  interest  in  the  maintenance  of  the  existing  territorial  arrange 
ments. 

5 

In  order  to  account  for  the  sudden  and  unexpected  change  which  has 
overcome  the  Emperor  of  Russia, the  Earl of Malmesbury then enters into  15 
a  psychological  analysis  of  "the  new  impressions  made  on  the  Emperor of 
Russia's mind." The "feelings" of the Emperor, he ventures to affirm, "were 
irritated  at  the  conduct  of  the  French  Government  in  regard  to  the  Holy 
Shrines  in  Palestine."  Bonaparte,  it  is  true,  in  order  to  allay those irritated 
feelings,  dispatched  M.  de  la  Cour  to  Constantinople,  "a man of  singularly  20 
mild  and  conciliatory  conduct."  But  says  the  Earl,  "it  appears  that  in  the 
Emperor  of  Russia's  mind, what had passed had  not been effaced,"  and that 
there  remained  a  residue  of  bitter  feeling  with  regard  to  France.  M.  De  la 
Cour,  it  must  be  confessed,  settled  the  question  finally  and  satisfactorily, 
before  Prince  Menchikoff's  arrival at Constantinople.  "Still the impression  25 
on the mind of the Russian Emperor remained unaltered." So strong was this 
impression,  and  the  mental  aberration  resulting  from  it,  "that the  Emperor 
still  suspected  the  Turkish  Government  of  wishing  to  impose  upon  Russia 
conditions which she had no right to impose." The Earl of Malmesbury owns 
that  it  is  "impossible"  not  only  for  "any  human  being,"  but  even  for  an  30 
English  Lord,  to  "read  the  human  mind;"  nevertheless,  "he  cannot  help 
thinking that he  can  account for those  strange  impressions  effected upon the 
Emperor  of  Russia's  mind."  The  moment,  he  says,  had  arrived,  which  the 
Russian  population  had  been  taught  for  many  generations  to  look  forward 
to  as  the  "predestinated  epoch  of  their  obtaining  Constantinople,  and  re-  35 
storing  the  Byzantine  Empire."  Now  he  supposes  "these  feelings"  to  have 
been  shared  by  "the  present  Emperor."  Originally,  the  sagacious  Earl  in 
tended  to  explain  the  Emperor's  obstinate  suspicion,  that  the  Turkish 
government wanted to  hurt him in his  rights,  and now  he  informs  us that he 
suspected  Turkey,  because  he  thought  the  proper  moment to  have  arrived  40 
of  swallowing  her.  Arrived  at  this  point  the  noble  Earl  had  necessarily  to 

288 

r 

Urquhart—Bern—The  Turkish  Question  in  the  House  of  Lords 

change  the  course  of  his  deductions.  Instead  of  accounting  for  the  new 
impressions  on  the  Emperor  of  Russia's  mind  which  altered  the  old  cir 
cumstances,  he  accounts  now  for  the  circumstances,  which  restrained  for 
some time the ambitious mind and the old traditional feeling of the Czar, from 
"giving way to temptation." These circumstances resolve themselves in the 
one  great fact,  that at one  period the Earl of Malmesbury was "in,"  and that 
at  the  other  period  he  was  "out." 

5 

15 

When  "in"  he was  the first, not only to  acknowledge  Boustrapa, but also 
to  apologize for his  perjury, his murders, and his usurpation. But, then, "the 
10  newspapers  of  the  day continually found fault with what they  called  a  sub 
servient and cringing policy to the French Emperor." The Coalition Ministry 
came, and with it Sir J. Graham and Sir Charles Wood, "condemning at public 
meetings  the  policy  and character  of the  French  Emperor,  and  condemning 
the French people,  too, for the choice of this prince as their sovereign. " Then 
followed the  Montenegro affair, and the coalition "allowing Austria to insist 
on  the  Sultan  giving up any further coercion of the rebellious  Montenegrins, 
and  not even  securing to the Turkish army a safe  and peaceable retreat, thus 
causing Turkey a loss of from  1,500 to  2,000 men. " At a later period the recall 
of  Col.  Rose  from  Constantinople,  the  refusal  of the  British Government to 
20  order  simultaneously with  France  their  fleet  to  Besika  Bay  or  Smyrna—all 
these  circumstances  together,  produced  the  impression  on  the  Emperor of 
Russia's  mind  that the people  and  the  Government of  England  were  hostile 
to  the  French  Emperor,  and  that no true  alliance was  possible between  the 
two  countries. 

30 

25 

Having  thus  traced  with  a  delicacy  worthy  of  a  romance-writer,  who 
analyzes  the  undulating  feelings  of  his  heroine,  the  succession  of  cir 
cumstances  belaboring  the  Emperor  of  Russia's  impressionable  mind  and 
seducing him from the path of virtue, the Earl of Malmesbury flatters himself 
to  have  broken  through  the  prejudices  and  antipathies  which had  alienated 
for  centuries  the  French  from the  English people by bis  close  alliance with 
the  oppressor  of  the  French  people,  he  congratulates  the  present  Govern 
ment upon having  inherited from him the intimate alliance with the Western 
Czar,  and  upon  having  reaped  where  the  Tories  had  sown.  He forgets  that 
it is  exactly this intimate alliance under the auspices of which the Sultan has 
35  been sacrificed to Russia, the Coalition being backed by the French Emperor, 
while  the  French  Soulouque  eagerly  seizes  the  opportunity  of  slipping  on 
the  shoulders of the Mussulman into a sort of Vienna Congress and becoming 
respectable.  In  the  same  breath  in  which  he  congratulates  the  Ministry  on 
their  close  alliance  with Bonaparte,  he denounces the very policy which has 
been  the  fruit  of  that  mésalliance. 

40 

We  shall  not  follow  the  Earl  in  his  expectorations  on  the  importance  of 

289 

Karl  Marx 

Turkish integrity, in his denial of her decay, in his repudiation of the Russian 
religious  Protectorate,  nor  in  his  reproaches  to  the  Government  for  not 
having declared the invasion of the Principalities  a casus belli,  and for not 
having  answered  the  crossing of  the  Pruth by  sending out their fleet. He has 
nothing  new  except  the  following  letter,  "perfectly  unsurpassed  for  in 
solence,"  addressed  by  Prince  Menchikoff  to  Rechid  Pasha  on  the  eve  of 
his  departure  from  Constantinople: 

"Bujukdere,  May  9,  (21st.) 

the  Eastern  Church,  which, 

At  the  moment  of  departure  from  Constantinople,  the  undersigned  am 
bassador of Russia, has  learnt that the Sublime Porte manifested its intention 
to  proclaim  a  guaranty  for  the  exercise  of  the  spiritual  rights  vested in the 
clergy  of 
in  fact,  renders  doubtful  the 
maintenance of the other privileges which that Church enjoys. Whatever may 
be  the  motive  of  this  determination,  the  undersigned  is  under the  necessity 
of informing his  Highness,  the  Minister of  Foreign Affairs, that a declaration 
or  any  other  act, which,  although it may preserve  the  integrity of the purely 
spiritual rights of the orthodox Eastern Church, tends to invalidate the other 
rights,  privileges  and  immunities  accorded  to  her  religion  and  clergy, from 
the  most  ancient  times,  and  which  they  enjoy  at  the  present  moment,  will 
be  considered  by  the  Imperial  Cabinet  as  an  act  of  hostility  to  Russia  and 
to  her  religion. 

The  undersigned  begs,  etc. 

Menchikoffr 

The  Earl  of  Malmesbury  "could  hardly  believe  that  the  Russian  Emperor 
countenanced  the  conduct  of  Prince  Menchikoff,  or the  manner in which he 
acted,"  a  doubt  confirmed  by  Nesselrode's  notes  following  Menchikoff's 
departure,  and  the  Russian  army  following  Nesselrode's  notes. 

The  "silent"  Clarendon,  "painful  as  it  was  to  him,"  was  obliged  "to  give 
the  same  answer over and over again," viz:  to give no  answer  at all. He felt 
it  "his  public  duty not to  say  a word" which he had not already  said, of "not 
laying  any  communication  before  them,  and  of not producing  any  separate 
dispatch. " The noble Earl accordingly gave not one iota of information which 
we  did  not  know  before.  His principal aim was to  establish that,  during the 
whole  time  that  the  Austrian  and  Russian  Cabinets  were  making  their  en 
croachments, he  was in "constant communication"  with them. Thus he was 
in  constant  communication  with  the  Austrian  Government  when  it  sent 
Prince Leiningen to Constantinople and its troops to the frontier, "because," 
at least this,  says the innocent Clarendon, was the  "reason given"—"because 
it  apprehended  an  outbreak  of  its  own  subjects  on  the  frontier."  After the 

290 

Urquhart—Bern—The  Turkish  Question  in  the  House  of  Lords 

5 

Sultan  had  yielded  to  Austria,  by  withdrawing  his  force,  the  energetic 
Clarendon  "was  again in communication  with Austria, in order to insure the 
full  execution of  the  treaty."  "I  believe,"  continues  the  credulous  Lord,  "it 
was  carried  out,  for the  Austrian  Government  assured us  that  such  was  the 
case."  Very  good,  my  Lord!  As  to  the  entente  cordiale with France, it had 
ever existed  since  1815! As to the part the French and English Governments 
took  "with respect to  the  sending of  their  respective  fleets,"  there  "was not 
a  shade  of  difference."  Bonaparte  ordered  his  fleet  to  proceed to  Salamis, 
"believing  that  danger  was  imminent,"  and,  "although  he  (Clarendon)  told 
10  him  the  danger  was  not  so  imminent,  and  that  for  the  moment it  was  not 
necessary  for  the  French  fleet  to  leave  the  French  ports,  he  ordered  the 
French  fleet  to  leave  them;  but this  circumstance  did not make the  slightest 
difference  because it was much more handy and more advantageous to have 
one  fleet  at  Salamis  and  the  other  at  Malta,  than  to  have  one  at  Malta and 
the  other  at  Toulon."  Lord  Clarendon  further  states  that  throughout  the 
insolent  pressure  of  Prince  Menchikoff  on  the  Porte  "it  was  a  matter  of 
satisfaction  that the  fleet was  not ordered out because no one could  say that 
the Turkish government acted under their dictation."  After what has passed, 
it  is  indeed  probable,  that,  had  the  fleet  then  been  ordered  out,  the  Sultan 
20  would have been forced to draw in. As to Menchikoff's "valedictory letter," 
Clarendon  owned  it  to  be  correct,  "but  such  language  in  diplomatic  ne 
gotiations with governments  was, fortunately, rare, and he hoped would long 
remain  so."  As to  the  invasion of the  Principalities, the  English and  French 
governments  "advised  the  Sultan  to  waive  his  undoubted  right  of  treating 
the occupation of the Principalities as a casus belli." 

15 

25 

As  to  the  negotiations  yet pending,  all he  would  say was that, "an official 
communication had been received this morning from Sir Hamilton Seymour, 
that  the  propositions  agreed  upon  by  the  Ambassadors  at Vienna, if slightly 
modified,  would  be  received  at  St.  Petersburgh."  As  to  the  terms  of  the 
settlement,  he  would  rather  die  than let them  slip  out. 

30 

35 

The  noble  Lord  was  responded  to  by  Lord  Beaumont,  the  Earl  of 
Hardwicke, the  Marquis of Clanricarde, and the Earl of Ellenborough. There 
was  not one single voice to felicitate her Majesty's Government on the course 
pursued  in  these  negotiations.  There  were  very  great  apprehensions  on  all 
sides that the ministerial policy had been the wrong way; that they had acted 
as  mediators  in behalf of Russia, instead of as  defenders of Turkey, and that 
an early  display  of firmness  on  the  part of  England and  France, would have 
placed  them  in  a  better  position  than  that  which  they  now  hold.  The  old 
obstinate  Aberdeen  answered  them,  that  "it was .easy  to  speculate  on what. 
40  would  have  been the  case,  after the  event had occurred; to  say what might 
have been the case, had they followed a different course." However, his most 

291 

Karl  Marx 

startling  and important  statement was the following:  "Their Lordships must 
be  aware that they were not bound by any treaty.  He denied that this country 
was  bound by the  stipulations  of  any treaty to take  part in any hostilities in 
support  of  the  Turkish  Empire." 

The  Emperor  of  Russia,  when  England  and  France  first  showed  then-
disposition  to  meddle  with the  pending Turkish affair, utterly repudiated the 
binding force  of the treaty of  1841  upon his own dealings with the Porte, and 
the  right  of  interposition  resulting  therefrom  on  the  part  of  the  Western 
Cabinets.  At  the  same  time  he  insisted upon the  exclusion  of  the  ships  of 
war  of  the  other  Powers  from  the  Dardanelles,  in virtue  of the  same treaty 
of  1841.  Now, Lord Aberdeen,  in open and  solemn assembly of Parliament, 
endorses  this  arrogant  interpretation  of  a treaty  which is  only respected by 
the  Autocrat when  it  excludes  Great  Britain  from  the  Euxine.

Lord  John  Russell  having  postponed his  explanations  on the  Turkish  ques-
tion  again  and  again,  till  at  last,  the  last  week of the  Parliamentary  session 
had happily arrived, came  suddenly forward on Monday last, and gave notice 
that he  would  make  his  long  deferred  statement on Tuesday.  The noble lord 
had  ascertained  that  Mr.  Disraeli  had  left  London  on  Monday  morning.  In 
the  same  manner  Sir Charles  Wood, when he  knew  Sir J. Pakington  and his 
10  partisans  to  be  out  of  the  House,  suddenly  brought  in  his  India  Bill,  as 
amended by the House of Lords, and carried, in a thin house without division, 
the  re-enactment of  the  Salt-Monopoly.  Such mean  and  petty  tricks  are  the 
nerves  and  sinews  of  Whig Parliamentary  tactics. 

15 

The  Eastern  question  in  the  House  of  Commons,  was  a most interesting 
spectacle.  Lord  J.Russell  opened  the  performances  in  a  tone  quite  con 
formed  to  the  part  he  had  to  play.  This  diminutive  earthman,  supposed  to 
be  the  last  representative  of  the  once  powerful Whig tribe,  spoke in a dull, 
low,  dry,  monotonous,  and  barren-spirited manner—not like  a Minister,  but 
like  a  police  reporter,  who  mitigates  the  horrors  of  his  tale  by  the  trivial, 
20  common-place, and business-like  style in which he relates  it.  He offered no 
"apology,"  but  he  made  a  confession.  If  there  was  any  redeeming  feature 
in  his  speech,  it  was  its  stiffness  itself,  which  seemed  intended  to  conceal 
some  painful  impressions  laboring  in  the  little  man.  Even  the  inevitable 
phrase of  "the independence and integrity of the Ottoman Empire," sounded 
like  an  old  reminiscence,  recurring,  by  some  inadvertence,  in  a  funeral 
oration  over  that  same  Empire.  The  impression  produced  by  this  speech, 
which  purported  to  announce  the  settlement  of  the  Eastern  complication, 

25 

293 

Karl  Marx 

may be judged from the fact that, as soon as transmitted by telegraph to Paris, 
the  funds  fell  immediately.

Lord  John was  right  in  stating  that he  had  not to defend the Government, 
the  Government not having been attacked; on the contrary, every disposition 
had been  shown on the  part of the  House  to  leave  negotiations  in the hands 
of  the  Executive.  Indeed  no  motion  has  been  put  by  any  member  of  Par 
liament  to  force  discussion upon Ministers,  and  there  has not been held any 
meeting  out  of  the  House  to  force  such  a  motion  upon  members  of  Par 
liament.  If  the  ministerial policy  has  been one  of  secrecy and mystification, 
it  was  so  with the  silent consent  of  Parliament  and of the  public.  As to the  10 
withholding  of  documents  while  negotiations  were  pending,  Lord  John 
asserted  it  to  be  an  eternal  law  established  by  parliamentary  tradition.  It 
would  be  tedious  to  follow  him  in  the  narration  of  events  familiar  to 
everybody,  and infused  with no new life by his manner of rather enumerating 
than  reciting  them.  There  are,  however,  some  important points  Lord  John  15 
was  the  first  officially  to  confirm. 

Before  Prince  Menchikoff's  arrival  at  Constantinople  the  Russian  Am 
bassador  informed Lord John that the Czar intended to  send a special mission 
to  Constantinople  with  propositions  relating  exclusively  to  the  Holy Cross 
and the  immunities  of the  Greek Church connected with them. The British  20 
Ambassador at St. Petersburg, and the British government at home suspected 
no  other  intention  on  the  part  of  Russia.  It  was  not  until  the  beginning  of 
March,  when  the  Turkish  Minister  informed  Lord  Stratford  (Mr.  Layard, 
however,  affirms  that  Colonel  Rose  and  many  other  persons  at  Constan 
tinople  were  already  initiated  in  the  secret)  that  Prince  Menchikoff  had  25 
proposed  a  secret treaty  incompatible  with  Turkish independence,  and that 
he  had  declared  it  to  be  the  intention  of  Russia  to  consider  any  communi 
cation  of  the  fact  to  either  France  or  England  as  an  act  of  direct  hostility 
against  Russia.  It  was  known  at  the  same  time,  not  from  mere  rumor,  but 
from authentic reports  that Russia was accumulating great masses of troops  30 
on  the  frontiers  of  Turkey  and  at  Odessa. 

As to the note forwarded by the Vienna Conference to the Czar, and agreed 
upon  by  him,  it  had  been  prepared  at  Paris  by  M. Drouyn  de  l'Huys,  who 
took  the  reply of Rechid  Pasha to  the  last Russian note  for  his  basis.  It was 
afterward  taken  up,  in an altered form, by  Austria,  as her own proposition,  35 
on the 24th July, and received its final touch on the 31 st of July. The Austrian 
Minister  having  previously  communicated  it to  the  Russian  Ambassador  at 
Vienna, it was already, on the 24th, conveyed to St. Petersburg before it was 
finally  arranged,  and it was  not  sent to  Constantinople  till the  2d of August, 
when  the  Czar  had  already  agreed  to  it.  Thus, after all, it is a Russian note  40 
addressed  through the  means  of  the  Four  Powers  to  the  Sultan,  instead of 

294 

The  Turkish  Question  in  the  Commons 

5 

a note of the Four Powers addressed to Russia and Turkey. Lord John Russell 
states  that  this  note  has  "not the  exact form  of Prince Menchikoff's note" 
owning  thereby  that  it  has  its  exact contents.  To  leave  no  doubt behind,  he 
adds:  "The Emperor considers that his objects will be attained. " T he draft 
contains  not  even  an  allusion  to  the  evacuation  of  the  Principahties. 
"Supposing that note," says Lord John, "to be finally agreed upon by Russia 
and Turkey,  there  will still remain  the great question of the evacuation of 
the  Principalities."  He  adds  at  the  same  time,  that  the  British  Government 
"considers this evacuation to be essential," but upon the mode by which this 
10  object  is  to  be  obtained  he  asks  permission  to  say  nothing.  He  gives  us, 
however,  sufficiently  to  understand  that  the  fleets  of  England  and  France 
may  have  to leave  Besika Bay before the  Cossacks  shall have  left the  Prin 
cipalities.  "We  ought not to  consent to  any  arrangement by which it may be 
stipulated  that  the  advance  of  the  fleets  to  the  neighborhood  of  the  Dar-
15  danelles  should  be  considered  as  equivalent  to  an  actual  invasion  of  the 
Turkish Territories.  But, of course, if the matter is settled, if peace is secured, 
Besika  Bay  is  not  a  station  which  would  be  of  any  advantage  either  to 
England  or  France."  Now,  as  no  man in his  senses  has  ever  supposed the 
French and English fleets are to remain for all time at Besika Bay, or France 
and  England  to  enter  into  a  formal  stipulation  forbidding  them to  advance 
to  the  neutral  neighborhood  of the Dardanelles, these  ambiguous  and  cum 
brous phrases, if they have any meaning at all, mean that the fleets will retire, 
after  the  note  shall  have  been  accepted  by  the  Sultan  and  the  Cossack 
promised  to  evacuate  the  Principalities.  "When the  Russian Government," 
says  Lord  John,  "had  occupied  the  Principalities,  Austria declared  that, in 
conformity  with the  spirit  of the Treaty of  1841, it was absolutely necessary 
that the representatives  of the Powers should meet in conference, and should 
endeavor to  obtain  some  amicable  solution of a difficulty which might other 
wise  threaten  the  peace  of  Europe." 

20 

25 

30 

Lord Aberdeen, on the contrary, declared some days  ago in the House of 
Lords,  and  also,  as  we  are  informed  from  other  sources,  in  a  formal  note 
communicated  to  the  Cabinets  of  St.  Petersburg  and Constantinople  in the 
course  of last June, that "the Treaty of  1841  did not in any way impose upon 
the  Powers  who  signed  it the  obligation of  actual  assistance  in behalf of the 
35  Porte,"  (but of  a temporary abstention from entering the Dardanelles!) "and 
that  the  Government of  Her  British  Majesty  held  themselves  perfectly free 
t o a ct  or  not  to  act,  according  to  its  own  interests."  Lord  Aberdeen  only 
repudiates  all  obligations  toward  Turkey,  in  order  not  to  possess  any right 
against  Russia. 

40 

Lord  John  Russell  concludes  with  "a  fat  aspect"  of  the  negotiations 
approaching  their  crowning  result.  This  seems  a very  sanguine view of the 

295 

Karl  Marx 

matter,  at the  moment when the  Russian  note,  arranged  at Vienna and to be 
presented  by  Turkey  to  the  Czar,  has  not  yet  been accepted  by the  Sultan, 
and  when  the  sine  qua  non of  the  Western  Powers,  viz:  the  evacuation  of 
the  Principalities,  has  not  yet  been  pressed  upon  the  Czar. 

Mr.  Layard,  the  first  speaker  who  rose  in response  to  Lord  John,  made 
by  far  the  best  and  most  powerful  speech—bold,  concise,  substantial,  filled 
with facts,  and  proving the  illustrious  scholar to be as intimately acquainted 
with  Nicholas  as  with  Sardanapalus,  and  with  the  actual  intrigues  in  the 
Orient  as  well  as  with  the  mysterious  traditions  of  its  past. 

5 

Mr.  Layard regretted that Lord Aberdeen had "on several occasions, and 
in  several  places,  declared  that  his  policy  is  essentially  a  policy  based  on 
peace."  If  England  shrunk from maintaining her honor and interests by war, 
she encouraged on the part of a lawless Power like Russia, pretensions which 
must  inevitably  lead  sooner  or  later  to  war.  The  present  conduct of  Russia 
must  not be  considered  as  a  mere  casual  and  temporary  occurence,  but as  15 
part  and  parcel  of  a  great  scheme  of  policy. 

10 

As  to  the  "concessions"  made  to  France  and  the  "intrigues"  of  M.  de 
Lavalette,  they could not even afford a pretext to Russia, because "a draught 
of  the  firman  making  those  concessions,  of  which  Russia  complains,  was 
delivered  by  the  Porte  to  M.  de  Titoff  some  days,  if  not weeks,  before  it  20 
was  issued,  and  no  objection  whatever  was  made  to  the  terms  of  that  fir 
man." 

Russia's designs with regard to  Servia, Moldo-Wallachia and the Christian 
population  of  Turkey  were  not  to  be  misunderstood.  Immediately  after  his 
public  entry  at Constantinople, Prince Menschikoff demanded the dismissal  25 
of  M.  Garashanin,  from  his  post  of  Servian  minister.  That  demand  was 
complied  with,  although  the  Servian  Synod  protested.  M.  Garashanin  was 
one  of  the  men  brought  forward  by  the  insurrection  of  1842,  that  national 
movement against Russian influence which expelled the then reigning Prince 
Michel from Servia; he and his family being mere tools in the hands of Russia. 30 
In  1843  the  Russian  Government  claimed the right of interference in Servia. 
Completely unauthorized by  any treaty, she was authorized by Lord Aber 
deen,  then  Minister  of  Foreign Affairs,  who declared,  "that Russia had the 
right to place her own construction on her own treaties. " "By her success 
in that transaction,"  says Mr. Layard, "Russia showed that she was mistress  35 
of  Servia  and  could  check  any  rising  independent  nationality." 

As  to  the  Danubian  Principalities,  Russia  first  took  advantage  of  the 
national movement of 1848 in those provinces, compelling the Porte to expel 
from  them  every man of  liberal  and independent opinions. Then,  she forced 
upon the Sultan the treaty of Balta Liman, by which she established her right  40 
to  interfere  in  all  the  internal  affairs  of  the Principalities,  "and her present 

296 

The  Turkish  Question  in  the  Commons 

occupation of them has  proved that  Moldavia and Wallachia are to all intents 
and  purposes  Russian  provinces." 

There  remained  the  Greeks  of  Turkey  and  the  Slavonians  of  Bulgaria 
professing  the  Christian  religion.  "The  spirit  of  inquiry  and  independence 
5  has  sprung  up  among  the  Greeks,  and  this  together with their  commercial 
intercourse  with the free  States  of  Europe,  has  greatly  alarmed  the Russian 
Government.  There was another cause, viz: the spread of the Protestant faith 
among the Christians  of the  East,  mainly through the influence and teachings 
of American missionaries,  scarcely  a considerable  town exists in Turkey, in 
10  which  there  is  not  a  nucleus  of  a Protestant  community.  (Another  motive 
for American intervention.) The Greek clergy, backed by the Russian mission 
have  done  all in their power to check this movement, and, when persecution 
was no  longer available, Prince Menchikoff  appeared at Constantinople. The 
great  end  of  Russia  has  been  to  crush  the  spirit  of  religious  and  political 
independence, which has manifested itself of late years among the Christian 
subjects  of  the  Porte." 

15 

As  to  the  establishment of  a  so-called  Greek Empte  at Constantinople, 
Mr.  Layard,  meaning  of  course  the  Greeks  in  contradistinction  to  the 
Slavonians,  stated  that  the  Greeks  amount  hardly  to  1,750,000;  that  the 
20  Slavonians  and  Bulgarians  have  been  struggling  for  years  to  throw  off  all 
connection with them,  by  refusing  to  accept for their clergy and bishops the 
priests of the Greek nation; that the Servians have created a Patriarch of their 
own  in  lieu  of  that  at  Constantinople;  and  that  establishing  the  Greeks  at 
Constantinople  would  be  playing  the  whole  of  Turkey  into  the  hands  of 

25  Russia. 

30 

35 

To  the  members  of  the  House,  who  declared  that  it  would  signify  little 
whether Constantinople was in the hands of Russia or not, Mr. Layard replied 
that,  Constantinople  being  broken,  all the  great Provinces which constitute 
Turkey, as, for instance, Asia-Minor, Syria and Mesopotamia, would fall into 
a  state  of  confusion  and  anarchy.  The  power  into  whose  hands  they were 
to  fall,  would command India. The power which held Constantinople, would 
ever  be  looked  upon  in  the  East  as  the  dominant  power  of  the  world. 

Russia,  however,  was  aware  that no  European  State  would  permit her  to 
take  possession  of  Constantinople  at  this  time.  Meanwhile,  "her  object  is 
to render all independent nationalities in that country impossible—to weaken 
the  Turkish  power  gradually,  but  surely;  and  to  show  to  those  who  would 
oppose  her  designs, that any  such opposition  is  not only useless, but would 
entail upon them her vengeance; in fact, to render any other government but 
her own impossible in Turkey.  In those designs she has enttely succeeded 

40  on this occasion." 

Mr. Layard represented that the  Government,  after the demand of a secret 

297 

Karl  Marx 

treaty  by  Prince  Menchikoff,  and  the  great  Russian  armaments  on  the 
frontier  and  at  Odessa,  they  were  satisfied  with  the  explanations  and  as 
surances  given  at  St.  Petersburg,  and  failed  to  declare  that  England  and 
France would consider the passing of the Pruth as  a  casus belli, and that they 
had  not  interdicted  Russia from  entering  into  any  treaties  or  engagements 
with  Turkey  without  their  participation.  "If  we  had  taken  that  step  Russia 
would  never  have  dared  to  cross  the  Pruth." 

5 

Mr.  Layard  then exposed how  the Principalities, independent, united with 
Bessarabia  and leaning on Hungary,  would ultimately be the only  means  of 
preserving  Constantinople  from  the  Russians,  and  for  cutting  the  great  10 
Sclave  race  in  two.  He  thinks  that  Russia  will evacuate  the  Principalities. 
"It  would  not be  worth the while  of  Russia  to engage in a war with the great 
Powers  of  Europe  on  account  of  those  provinces, which are  already, to  all 
intents  and purposes, her own. Russia has gained, without firing a shot, what 
is  worth  to  her  a bloody  and  expensive  campaign;  she  has  established  her  15 
power  in  the  East;  she  has  humiliated Turkey;  she  has  compelled her to  go 
to  all  the  expense  of  a  war,  and  has  exhausted  her  resources;  but,  what  is 
more,  she  has  humiliated  this  country  and  France  in  the  eyes  of  her  own 
subjects  and  of  the  populations  of  the  East." 

The  note  drawn  up  by  the  Vienna  Conference  will  have  the  result that,  20 

"if  the  Porte  declines  to  adhere  to  it,  Russia  will  have  turned  the  tables 
completely  upon  us,  and made  us  her  ally  against Turkey in compelling her 
to  accept  an unjust proposal.  If  she  accept, England has directly  sanctioned 
the  right of  Russia to  interfere in behalf of twelve millions of Christians, the 
subjects  of  the  Porte  . ..  Look  at the question as we  will, it is clear that we  25 
have  taken  the  place  of  a  second-rate  Power  in  it,  and  conceded  that  of  a 
first-rate  Power to  Russia  alone  . ..  We  had  an  opportunity  which,  perhaps, 
will  never occur  again of settling on a proper basis this great Eastern question 
. ..  Russia  has  been  enabled  to  strike  a blow from  which Turkey  will  never 
recover  . ..  The result of  the  policy which this  country has pursued will  not  30 
end here.  Sweden,  Denmark,  every weak State of Europe, which has placed 
dependence  on  the  character  of  this  country,  will  see  that  it  is useless  any 
more  to  struggle  against  the  encroachments  of  Russia." 

Sir  John  Pakington  next  made  some  remarks,  which  were  important  as 
declaratory of the views of the Tory opposition. He regretted that Lord John  35 
Russell  could  not  make  a  statement  more  satisfactory  to  the  House  and  to 
the  country.  He  assured  the  Government that its  determination to  consider 
the  evacuation of  the  Principalities as a sine qua non, will "be  supported not 
only  by  the  opinion  of this  House, but by the  almost unanimous  opinion of 
the  people  of  this  country."  Till  the papers  should have been produced, he  40 
must  reserve  his judgment  on the  policy  of  advising  Turkey  not  to consider 

298 

Γ' 

The  Turkish  Question  in  the  Commons 

the occupation of the Principalities as a casus belli, of not following a more 
vigorous  and  decisive  policy  at  an  earlier  period,  of  injuring  and  holding  in 
suspense  the  interests  of  Turkey  and  of  Great  Britain,  and  their  commerce, 
by  transactions  protracted  for  six  months.

Lord  Dudley  Stuart  indulged  in  one  of  his  habitual  good-natured  De­
mocratic  declamations,  which  are  certainly  more  gratifying  to  the  man  who 
spouts  them  than to  anybody else.  If you compress  inflated balloons  or blown 
up phrases, there remains nothing in your hands, not even the wind that made 
them  appear  like  something.  Dudley  Stuart  repeated  the  often  repeated 
statements  on  the  improvements  going  on  in  Turkey,  and  on  the  greater 
liberality  of  the  Sultan's  rule,  whether  in  regard  to  religion  or  commerce, 
when  compared  with  that  of Russia.  He  remarked,  justly,  that it was useless 
to  boast  of  peace,  while  the  unhappy  inhabitants  of  the  Danubian  Prin­
cipalities  actually endured the  horrors  of war.  He  claimed for the inhabitants 
of  these  provinces  the  protection of  Europe  against the  terrible  oppression 
to  which  they  were  now  subjected.  He  showed,  by  facts  from Parliamentary 
history,  that  the  members  of  the  House  had  the  right  of  speechifying,  even 
while  negotiations  were  going  on.  He  forgot hardly  anything,  which  must be 
familiar  to  a  true  and  constant  reader  of  The  Daily News.  There  were  two 
"points"  in his  speech:  "Although the  explanation of the  noble lord (J. Rus­
sell)  had  not been  very full,  for  he  told  the  House  nothing but  what  it  knew 
before,  still,  from  its  very  omissions,  he  was  afraid  that  they  must  come  to 
the  conclusion,  that the noble lord had been doing something of which he 
ought  to  be  ashamed."  As  to  the  Earl  of  Aberdeen,  "he  had  told  them  that 
peace  had  been  preserved  for  thirty  years,  with  great  advantage  to  the 
prosperity  and  liberty  of  Europe,  but  he  (Dudley  Stuart)  denied  that  the 
liberty  of  Europe  had  been  benefited  by  the  peace.  Where,  he  would  ask, 
was  Poland?  where  Italy?  where  Hungary?—nay,  where  Germany?"  Borne 
along  by  the  power  of  fluency,  that  fatal  gift  of  third-rate  orators,  the 
30  Democratic  lord  cannot  stop,  till  he  arrives,  from the  despots  of  the  Con­

25 

20 

tinent,  to  his  native  monarch,  "who  rules  in  the  hearts  of  her  subjects." 

Mr.  M. Milnes,  one  of  those  ministerial  retainers,  on  whose  brow  you 

read: 

"Do  not  talk  of  him 
But  as  a  property," 

did  not  dare  to  make  a decidedly ministerial  speech.  He made  an alternative 
speech.  On the  one  side  he  found  that  Ministers,  by  withholding  the  papers 
from  the  table  of  the  House, "acted with very great prudence and judgment," 
but,  on  the  other  hand,  he  gave  them  to  understand  that  they  would  have 
acted  "more  strongly and firmly" the other way.  On the one hand he thought 

35 

40 

299 

Karl  Marx 

the  Government  might  have  been  right  in  submitting  to  the  demands  of 
Russia,  but,  on the  other hand,  it  seemed questionable to  him whether they 
had  not, in  some degree, encouraged Turkey to pursue a line of policy which 
they were  not prepared to  support, etc., etc. On the whole, he made out that 
"the  more  he  reflected  on  those  subjects,  the  more  extreme  were  the  dif- 
ficulties  which  they  presented  to  his  mind"—the  less  he  understood  those 
subjects,  the  better  he  understood  the  temporizing  policy  of  the  Govern 
ment.

After  the  alternative  juggle  and  perplexed  mind  of  Mr.  Monckton Milnes 
we  are  refreshed  by  the  rough  straightforwardness  of Mr.  Muntz,  M.P.  for  10 
Birmingham, and one of the matadores of the Reform-House of 1831. "When 
the Dutch Ambassador made to Charles II.  some very objectionable proposi 
tion,  the  King  replied:  'God  bless  me!  you  never  made  such  a  proposition 
to  Oliver  Cromwell.'  'No,'  said  the  Ambassador,  'you  are  a  very  different 
man from Oliver Cromwell.' If this country had had now such a man as Oliver  15 
Cromwell,  we  should  have  had  a  different  Minister,  and  a  very  different 
Government,  and  Russia  would  never  have  marched  into  the  Danubian 
Provinces.  The  Emperor  of  Russia  knew,  that  nothing  would  make  this 
country go  to war:  witness  Poland, witness Hungary. This country was now 
reaping the benefit of its  own conduct in those instances.  He considered the  20 
state of this  country in relation to its foreign affairs was  a very objectionable 
and  a  very  unsatisfactory  one.  And  he  believed that the  people  of  England 
felt  that  their  character  had  been  degraded,  and  that  all  sense  of  honor  on 
the  part of the  Government  was  absorbed in consideration  of  mere pounds, 
sliulings  and  pence.  The  only  questions  mooted  by  the  Government  now  25 
were,  simply what  would  be the expense, and would war be agreeable to the 
different  tradesmen of  the  nation?"  Birmingham  happening to be the center 
of  an  armament-manufacturing  and  musket-selling  population,  the  men  of 
that  town  naturally  scoff  at  the  Manchester  Cotton-Peace-Fraternity. 

Mr.  Blackett, the member for Newcastle-on-Tyne, did not believe that the  30 

Russians would evacuate the Principalities. He warned the Government  "noi 
to  be  swayed by any dynastic sympathies  or antipathies. " 

Assailed  on  all  sides,  from  all  shades  of  opinion,  the  ministers  sat  there 
mournful,  depressed,  inanimate,  broken  down;  when Richard  Cobden  sud 
denly rose, congratulating them for having adopted his peace doctrines  and  35 
applying that doctrine to the given case, with all the sharp ingenuity and f air 
sincerity  of  the  monomaniac;  with all  the  contradictions  of the  idéologue, 
and with all the calculating cowardice of the  shop-keeper.  He preached what 
the  ministry  had  openly  acted,  what  the  Parliament  had  silently  approved, 
and what the ruling classes had enabled the ministry to do and the Parliament  40 
to  accept.  From  fear  of  war  he  attained  for  the  first time  to  something like 

300

The  Turkish  Question  in  the  Commons 

historical  ideas.  He  betrayed  the  mystery  of  middle-class  policy,  and  there­
fore  he  was  repudiated  as  a  traitor.  He  forced  middle-class  England  to  see 
herself  as  in  a  mnror,  and  as  the  image  was  by  no  means  a  flattering  one, 
he  was  ignominiously  hissed.  He  was  inconsistent,  but  his  inconsistency 
itself  was  consistent.  Was  it  his  fault  if  the  traditional  fierce  phrases  of  the 
aristocratic past did not harmonize with the pusiUanimous facts of the stock­
jobbing  present?

He  commenced  by  declaring  that  there  was  no  difference  of  opinion  on 
the  question:  "Still,  there  was  apparently  very  great  uneasiness  on  the 
subject  of  Turkey."  Why  was  this?  Within  the  last  twenty  years  there  had 
been a growing conviction that the Turks in Europe were intruders in Europe ; 
that  they were  not  domiciled  there;  that their  home  was  Asia;  that Moham­
medanism could  not  exist in  civilized  States;  that  we could not maintain the 
independence  of  any  country,  if  she  could  not  maintain  it  for  herself;  that 
it was now known that there were three Christians to every Turk hi European 
Turkey.  "We  could  not  take  a  course  which  would insure  Turkey in Europe 
as  an independent power  against Russia, unless the great bulk of the popula­
tion were with us  in our desire  to prevent another power from  taking posses­
sion of that c o u n t r y . .. As to sending our fleets up to Besika Bay, and keeping 
20 out the Russians, no doubt we could do that, because Russia would not come 
into collision with a maritime power ; but we were keeping up these enormous 
armaments, and were not settling the  Eastern Question... The question was, 
what  were  they  going to  do  with Turkey,  and  with the  Christian  population 
of  Turkey.  Mohammedanism  could  not  be  maintained;  and  we  should  be 
sorry  to  see  this  country  fighting  for  Mohammedanism  in  Europe."  Lord 
Dudley  Stuart had talked about maintaining Turkey on account of commerce. 
He  (Cobden)  never  would  fight  for  a  tariff.  He  had  too  much  faith  in  free 
trade principles  to  think that they needed fighting for.  The exports to Turkey 
had  been  overrated.  Very  little  of  it  was  consumed  in  the  countries  under 
the  dominions  of  the  Turks.  "All  the  commerce  which we  had  in the  Black 
Sea,  was  owing to the encroachments of Russia upon the Turkish coast.  Our 
grain  and  flax  we  did not now  get from  Turkey, but from  Russia.  And would 
not  Russia  be  as  glad  to  send  us  her  tallow,  hemp  and  corn,  whatever  ag­
gressions  she  might  make  on  Turkey?  We  had  a  trade  with  Russia  in  the 
35  Baltic  . ..  What  prospect  had  we  of  a  trade  with  Turkey?  It  was  a  country 
without  a  road.  Russia  was  the  more  commercial  people.  Let us  look  at  St. 
Petersburg,  at  her  quays  and  wharves,  and  warehouses  . ..  What  national 
alliance  then  could  we  have  with  such  a country  as  Turkey?  . ..  Something 
had  been  said  about  the  balance  of  power.  That  was  a  political view  of  the 
40  question  . ..  A  great  deal  had  been  said  about the  power  of Russia,  and  the 
danger  to  England  in  consequence  of her  occupying those  countries  on the 

25 

30 

301 

Karl  Marx 

Bosphorus. Why, what an absurdity it was to talk of Russia coming to invade 
England.  Russia could  not  move  an  army  across  her  own frontiers,  without 
coming to Western Europe for a l o a n . .. A country so poor, amere aggregate 
of villages without capital and without resources, as compared with England, 
never  could come  and injure us, or America, or France  . ..  England was ten 
times  more  powerful than  she  had  ever been,  and far  more able to resist the 
aggressions  of  a  country  like  Russia." 

5 

And  now  Cobden  passed  to  the  incomparably  greater  dangers  of  war  to 
England in her present condition, than at former epochs.  The manufacturing 
population  had  greatly  increased.  They  were  far  more  dependent  on  the  10 
export  of  their  produce  and  on the import of raw materials. They possessed 
no  longer  the  monopoly  of  manufacture.  The repeal  of the  navigation laws 
had thrown England open to the competition of the world in shipping as well 
as in everything else.  "He begged Mr. Blackett to consider that no port would 
suffer  more  than  that  which  he  represented.  The  Government  had  done  15 
wisely  in  disregarding  the  cry  of  thoughtless  men  . ..  Their  taking  up  a 
position for maintaining the integrity  of the Turkish Empire he did not blame, 
as  that was  a  traditional  policy  handed  down to  them  . ..  The  Government 
of  the  day  would  obtain  credit  for  having  been  as  peaceable  as  the  people 
would  allow  them  to be." 

20 

25 

Richard  Cobden  was  the  true  hero  of  the  drama,  and  shared  the  fate  of 
all true  heroes—a tragical  one.  But then came the  sham hero; the fosterer of 
all  delusions,  the  man  of  fashionable  lies  and  of  courtly  promises;  the 
mouth-piece  of all brave  words that  may  be  said in the act of rurming away; 
Lord Palmerston came. This old, experienced and crafty debater saw at once 
that the criminal might escape  sentence by disavowing his advocate.  He  saw 
that  the  Ministry,  attacked  on  all  sides,  might  turn  the  tables  by  a brilliant 
diatribe against the  only  man who  dared to  defend it, and by refuting the only 
grounds  on  which  its  policy  possibly  might  have  been  excused.  There  was 
nothing easier than to show the contradictions of Mr. Cobden.  He had stated  30 
his  perfect  concurrence  with  the  precedent orators,  and  ended by  differing 
from  them  on  every  point.  He had  defended the integrity of Turkey,  and did 
everything to  show that she was worth no defence. He, the preacher of peace, 
had  advocated  the  aggressions  of  Russia.  Russia was  weak, but a war with 
Russia  would  be  inevitable  ruin  to  England.  Russia was  a conglomerate  of  35 
mere  villages,  but  St.  Petersburg  being  a  finer  city  than  Constantinople, 
Russia  was  entitled  to  possess  them  both.  He  was  a  free-trader,  but  he 
preferred the protective  system of Russia to the free-trade system of Turkey. 
Whether  Turkey  consumed  herself,  or  was  a  canal  through  which  passed 
articles  of  consumption to  other parts  of  Asia, was it indifferent to England  40 
that  she  should  remain a free passage? Mr.  Cobden was  a great advocate for 

302 

ir 

The  Turkish  Question  in  the  Commons 

5 

the  principle  of  non-intervention,  and now  he  would  dispose,  by parliamen 
tary  enactments,  of  the  destinies  of  the  Mahomedans,  Greeks,  Slavonians, 
and  other  races  inhabiting the Turkish Empire.  Lord Palmerston exalted the 
progress  Turkey  had  made,  and  the  forces  she  now  commanded.  "Turkey, 
it  is  certain,  has  no  Poland  and  no  Siberia."  Because  Turkey  possessed  so 
much  strength,  Lord  Palmerston  would,  of  course,  compel  her  to  suffer  a 
few  provinces  to  be  invaded  by  the  Russians.  A  strong  empire  can  suffer 
anything.  Lord  Palmerston proved  to Richard Cobden that there existed not 
one  sound reason for adopting  the  course  adopted by  Lord  Palmerston  and 
10  his  colleagues, and, interrupted at each sentence by enthusiastic cheers, the 
old histrion contrived to  sit  down,  with the impudent and self-contradictory 
phrase:  "I  am  satisfied  that Turkey has  within itself the elements of life and 
prosperity,  and  I believe  that the  course  adopted  by  Her  Majesty's  govern 
ment is  a  sound policy, deserving the approbation of the country, and which 
15 it will be the duty of every English government to pursue." (Cheers.) Palmer 
ston was  great in  "fearful bravery, " as  Shakespeare calls it.  He showed, as 
Sidney  said,  "a  fearful  boldness,  daring  to  do  that  which  he  knew  that  he 
knew  not  how  to  do."

New-York  Daily  Tribune. 
Nr.3864,  5. September  1853 

Affairs  Continental  and English. 

Correspondence  of  the  N.Y.Tribune. 

London, Tuesday, Aug.  23,  1853. 

The  German  and  Belgian  papers  affirm,  on  the  authority  of  telegraphic 
dispatches  from Constantinople, of the  13th inst, that the Porte has acceded 
to  the  proposals  of  the  Vienna  conference.  The  French  papers,  however, 
having  received  dispatches  from  Constantinople  of  the  same  date,  state 
merely  that  the  Divan  had  shown  a willingness  to  receive  those proposals. 
The  definitive  answer  could  hardly  reach  Vienna  before  the  20th inst.  The 
pending question,  and  a very  serious  one, is, whether the  Porte  will send its 
Ambassador to  St. Petersburgh before or  after the withdrawal of the Russian 
troops  from  the  Principalities. 

The  last  accounts  from  the  Black  Sea announce  that the north-east winds 
had  begun  to  disturb  the  navigation.  Several  ships  anchored  at Penderaklia 
and  other  places  on  the  coast,  had  been  compelled  to  quit  their  anchorage 
to  avoid  being  cast  ashore. 

You  know  that after the events in Moldavia and Wallachia, the  Sultan had 
ordered  the  Hospodars  to  leave  the  Principalities  for  Constantinople,  and 
that  the  Hospodars  refused  to  comply  with their  sovereign's  demands.  The 
Sultan has  now deposed the Hospodar of Wallachia on account of his favor 
able  reception  of  the  Russian  troops  and  the  support he  gave  them.  On the 
9th  inst.  this  firman  was  read to  the  Assembly  of  Boyards,  who  resolved to 
petition  the  Hospodar not to  abandon the Government in the present critical 
circumstances.  The  Prince  acted accordingly.  Mano,  the Secretary of State, 
and  Yvandis,  the  Director  of  the  Ministry  of  the  Interior,  have  also  been 
summoned  to  Constantinople;  they,  however,  refused to go,  on the pretext 
that public order might be  disturbed.  The  French  and  British Consuls, upon 
this,  suspended  immediately  all  relations  with  the  rebel  Government. 

304 

Affairs  Continental  and  English 

Affairs  in  Servia  are  taking  a  complicated  turn.  The Paris  Constitutionnel 
of last  Friday had the  following  Constantinople intelligence.  Austria, taking 
advantage of the Sultan's difficulties, had pressed certain demands upon him. 
An Austrian Consul General, having lately made a tour of inspection through 
5  Bosnia and  Servia,  declared to  Alexander, the Prince of Servia, that Austria 
was  prepared  to  occupy  Servia  with  her  troops  in  order  to  suppress  any 
dangerous  movement among the  population.  The Prince, having refused the 
offer  of  the  Consul  General,  at  once  dispatched  a  special  messenger  to 
Constantinople with  an account of this Austrian overture, and Rechid Pasha 
referred  to  the  Baron  de  Bruck  for  explanations.  The  latter  said  that  the 
Consul  General  had  previously  communicated with the  Prince,  alleging the 
fear Austria was in, lest her subjects, on the borders of Servia, should become 
involved  in  any  disturbances  arising  in  that province.  The  reply  of  Rechid 
Pasha  was  to  the  effect  that  any  occupation  of  Servia  by  Austrian  troops 
15  would  be  considered  an  act  of  hostility by the Porte, which would itself be 
answerable  for  the  tranquillity  of  that  province;  moreover,  the  Pasha 
promised  that  a  special  Commissioner  should  be  at  once  sent  to  see  and 
report  on  the  state  of  affairs  in  Servia. 

10 

The  day after,  several London papers  announced the entrance into Servia 
20  of  the  Austrian  troops,  an  announcement which,  however,  has  turned  out 
to  be  unfounded.  Yesterday  the  same  papers  communicated  the  outbreak 
of  a counter-revolution in  Servia,  yet this  news  likewise  rested  on no better 
foundation  than  a  false  translation  of  the  German  word,  Auflauf,  the  fact 
being  that  only  a  small  riot  had  taken  place.  To-day  the  German  papers 
25 publish news from Constantinople of the 9th inst. According to them, several 
divans  had  been  held  on  Servian  affairs.  The  conduct of Prince  Alexander 
was  much  approved  of,  and  the  decision  arrived  at that,  if  Austrian troops 
should  attempt  to  occupy  that  province,  they  should,  if  necessary,  be  ex 
pelled by force.  A  division of  troops  has  actually been  directed towards the 
30 frontiers of Bosnia. Private letters received at Constantinople on the 8th inst., 
conveyed  thither  the  news  of  Prince  Alexander  having,  in  consequence  of 
his conflict with the Austrian Consul,  appealed to the decision of the Consuls 
of  France  and  England,  and  absented  himself  momentarily from  Belgrade. 
It  is  said  that  he  went  to  Nissa,  there  to  wait  for  orders  from  the  Porte. 
35  Mr.  D.  Urquhart,  in  a  letter  addressed  to  The  Morning  Advertiser  of  this 

day,  remarks,  with regard  to  the  Servian  complication: 

"War  with  Turkey  is  not  at  present  contemplated  by  Russia;  for,  by the 
cooperation  of  Austria,  she  would  lose  her  Greek  allies,  but  she  involves 
Austria  in  a  preparatory  collision,  which will  bring  Servia  into  a  condition 
40  parallel  to  that  of  the  Principalities.  Thus  will  be  introduced  a  religious 
warfare  between  Latins  and  Greeks  . ..  Russia,  by  a  sudden  shifting  of 

305 

Karl  Marx 

decorations,  may render her own occupation of the Principalities  acceptable 
to Turkey, as a protection against the Austrian occupation of Servia, and thus 
mutually  engage  Austria  and  Turkey  in  projects  of  dismemberment,  and 
support  them  therein." 

The  Hospodar  of  Moldavia  proposes  to  contract  a  loan  with  Russian 

5 

bankers  in  order  to  meet  the  extraordinary  expenses  of  the  occupation. 

The  want  of  provisions  is  so  great  in  the  fortresses  of  Bulgaria  that  the 
strictest  economy  has  to  be  observed,  and  the  garrisons  are  suffering 
severely. 

10 

The Journal de  Constantinople reports from Aleppo: 
"A  discovery  has  recently  been  made  of  a  gang  of  evil-disposed  Turks 
about  to  rise,  as  in  1850,  against the Christian population of that town.  But 
thanks  to  the  extreme  vigilance  of  the  Governor  Pasha,  and  of  Ah'  Asmi 
Pasha, the  commander-in-chief  of the troops  at  Aleppo, their attempts have 
been  suppressed  and  public  order  has  been  preserved.  On  this  occasion  15 
Demetrius,  the  patriarch  of  the  Greek  Catholic  creed,  and  Basilius,  the 
patriarch  of  the  Armenian  creed,  have  addressed  in  the  name  of  their  re 
spective  communities,  a collective  letter  of  gratitude  to  Rechid  Pacha,  for 
the  protection  afforded  to  the  Christians  by  the  Sultan's  government." 

The  German  St.  Petersburgh  Gazette  has  the  following  in  a  leader  on  20 

Oriental  Affairs: 

"What the friends  of  peace  could  only  hope  for  at the  comhiencement of 
July,  has  become  a  certainty  in  the  latter  days.  The  work  of  mediation 
between  Russia  and  Turkey  is  now  definitively  placed  in  the  hands  of-
Austria.  At Vienna there  will be  devised  a  solution of the  Eastern question,  25 
which  in these  latter  times  has  kept  in  suspense  all  the  action between the 
Black  Sea  and  the  Ocean,  and  which  alone  has  prevented  European  Di 
plomacy  from  taking  its  habitual  holidays." 

Observe  the  studious  affectation  with which,  in lieu of  the  Four  Powers, 
Austria  alone  is  constituted  mediator,  and  which  places  the  suspense  of  30 
nations, in the true Russian style, only on a scale with the interrupted holidays 
of  diplomacy. 

The  Berlin  National  Zeitung publishes  a  letter  from  Georgia,  dated  15th 
July,  stating  that  Russia intends  a new  campaign  against the  people  of  the 
Caucasus at the end of the present month, and that a fleet in the sea of Azof f 35 
is  fitted  out  in  order  to  support  the  operations  of  the  land  army. 

The  session  of  1853  was  brought  to  a  close  on Saturday last—Parliament 
being  prorogued  until  October  27.  A  very  indifferent  and  meager  speech, 
purporting  to  be  the  Queen's  message, was read by commission.  In answer 
to  Mr.  Milnes  Lord  Palmerston  assured  Parliament that it could  safely  dis-  40 
band,  as  far  as  the  evacuation  of  the  Principalities  was  concerned,  giving, 

306 

Affairs  Continental  and  English 

5 

however,  no  pledge  of  any  kind  but  "his  confidence  in  the  honor  and  the 
character  of  the  Russian  Emperor,"  which would move him  to withdraw his 
troops  voluntarily  from  the  Principalities.  The  Coalition  Cabinet  thus  re 
venged  itself  for  his  speech  against  Mr. Cobden,  by  forcing  him  to  record 
solemnly  his  "confidence  in the  character  and the  honor" of the  Czar.  The 
same Palmerston received on the  same day a deputation from the aristocratic 
fraction of the Polish Emigration at Paris and its collateral branch at London, 
presenting  his  lordship  with  an  address  and  medallions  in  gold,  silver  and 
bronze  of  Prince  Adam  Czartoryski,  in  testimony  of  their  gratitude  to  his 
lordship for allowing the  sequestration of Cracow in  1846, and for otherwise 
exhibiting  sympathy  with  the  cause  of Poland.  The  inevitable  Lord Dudley 
Stuart,  the  patron of  the  London branch of  the  Paris  society,  was  of course 
the  master  of  ceremonies.  Lord  Palmerston  assured  these  simple-minded 
men  "of  his  deep  interest in the  history of Poland, which was a very painful 
15  history."  The  noble  lord  omitted  not  to remind  them  that he  spoke  not  as 
a  member  of  the  Cabinet,  but received  them  only  as  a  private  amateur.

The  first half  of  the  long protracted  session of  1853 was filled up with the 
death-struggle  of  the  Derby  Ministry,  with  the  formation  and  final  victory 
of  the  Coalition  Cabinet,  and  with  the  Easter  recess  of  Parliament.  As  to 
the real  session, its  most remarkable features were the  dissolution of all the 
old  political  parties,  the  corruption  of  the  members  of  Parliament,  and  the 
petrifaction  of  the  privileged  constituencies  revealing  the  curious  working 
of  the  Government,  embracing  all the  shades  of  opinion,  and  all the talents 
of  the  official  world,  proclaiming  postponement  of  the  solution of  all  ques-
tions,  shifting  all  difficulties  by  half  and  half  measures,  feeding  upon 
promises,  declaring "performance as a kind of will or testament which argues 
a  great  weakness  in  his  judgment  that  makes  it,"  retracting,  modifying, 
unsettling its own legislative acts  as quickly as it brought them in, living upon 
the  inheritance  of  predecessors  whom  it  had  fiercely  denounced,  leaving 
the  initiative  of  its  own  measures  to  the  house  which  it  presumed  to 
lead,  and  reaping  failure  as  the  inevitable  fate  of  the  few  acts,  the  uncon-
troverted  authorship  of  which it holds.  Thus parliamentary reform, national 
education reform,  and  law reform  (a few trifles  apart) have been postponed. 
The  Transportation  bill,  the  Navigation  bill,  etc.,  were  inherited  from  the 
35  Derby  Cabinet.  The  Canada Clergy  Reserves  bill  was  dreadfully mutilated 
by the  Government  a few  days  after  having introduced it.  As  to  the budget, 
the  Succession  act  was  proposed  by  the  Chancellor of  the  Exchequer  only 
after  he  had voted  against it.  The Advertisement  act was  undergone by him 
only when his opposition to it had twice been voted down. The new regulation 
40  of the licensing  system was finally  abandoned,  after it had  suffered various 
transformations.  Introduced  by  Mr.  Gladstone  with pretensions  to  a  great 

30

scheme,  a  thing  worth the  budget  as  a  whole,  it  came  out  of  the  House  as 
a  miserable  patch-work,  as  a  mere  conglomerate  of  fortuitous,  incoherent 
and  contradictory  little  items.  The  only  great  feature  of  the  India bill,  the 
non-renewal of the Company's  charter, was  introduced by the Ministry after 
they had  announced  its  renewal  for  20  years  more.  The  two  acts truly and 
exclusively  belonging  to  the  Ministry of all  the  talents;  the  Cab-act and  the 
Conversion  of  the  Public  Debt,  had  scarcely  passed  the  threshold  of  the 
House,  when they were publicly hissed as failures. The foreign policy of the 
"strongest  Government  England  ever  saw,"  is  owned by  its  own partisans 
to  have  been  the  nec  plus  ultra  of  helpless,  vacillating  weakness.  The 
Chesham  Place  Treaty,  however,  contracted  between  the  Peelite  bureau 
crats,  the  Whig  oligarchs  and  the  sham-Radicals,  has  been linked the  more 
strongly  by  the  threatening  aspect  of  things  abroad  and  by  the  even  more 
imminent  symptoms  of  popular  discontent at home—manifested  through the 
unprecedented  intensity  and  generality  of  strikes,  and  the  renewal  of  the 
Chartist agitation.  In judging the  external policy of the ruling classes and of 
the  Cabinet,  we  must  not  lose  sight  of  a  war  with Russia training behind it 
a general revolutionary conflagration of the  Continent,  and  at this time likely 
to  meet  with  a  fatal  echo  from  the  masses  of  Great  Britain. 

As  to  the  House  of  Lords,  its  doings  admit of  a very  short résumé.  It has 
exhibited  its  bigotry  by  the  rejection  of  the  Jewish  Emancipation  bill,  its 
hostility  to  the  working classes  by  burking the  Workingmen's  Combination 
bill, its  interested hatred of the  Irish people by  shelving the Irish Land bills, 
and  its  stupid  predilection  for  Indian  abuses  by  re-establishing  the  Salt 
monopoly.  It has acted throughout in secret understanding with the Govern 
ment  that  whatever  progressive  measures  might  by  chance  pass  the  Com 
mons,  should  be  canceled  by  the  enlightened  Lords. 

Among  the  papers  laid  on  the  table  of Parliament before  its  prorogation, 
there  is  a  voluminous  correspondence  carried  on  between  the  British  and 
Russian  Governments  with  regard  to  the  obstructions  to  navigation  in  the 
Sulina mouth of the Danube.  The correspondence begins on Feb. 9,1849, and 
concludes  in  July,  1853,  having  concluded  nothing whatever.  Things  have 
now  arrived  at  such  a  point that  even  the  Austrian  Government is forced to 
announce  that  the  mouth of  the  Danube  has  become  impassable for naviga 
tion,  and that its  own  mails  to  Constantinople  will be  henceforth forwarded 
by Trieste.  The  whole  difficulty  is  the  fruit  of British connivance at Musco 
vite  encroachments.  In  1836  the  English  Government  acquiesced  in  the 
usurpation  of  the  mouth  of  the  Danube  by  Russia,  after  having  instructed 
a  commercial  firm  to  resist  the  interference  of  the  officers  of  the  Russian 
Government.

Affairs  Continental  and  English 

tion  of the  Governor-General  of  India,  dated June  30,1853, and upon which 
the  Queen is  made to  congratulate  Parliament,  is nothing but a simple truce. 
The  King  of  Ava,  starved  into  submission,  expressed  his  desire  for  the 
cessation  of  war,  set  the  British  prisoners  at liberty,  asked  for  the  raising 
5  of  the  river  blockade,  and  forbade  his  troops  to  attack  the  territories  of 
Mecadeay  and  Tungaoo,  where  the  British  Government  had  placed  garri 
sons—in  the  same  manner  as  the  Turkish  Government  has  forbidden  its 
troops  to  attack the Russians  stationed  in the Principalities. But he does not 
recognize  the  claims  of  England  to  Pegu  or  to  any  other  portion  of  the 
10  Burmese  Empire.  All  that  England  has  got  by  this  struggle  is  a  dangerous 
and  controverted  frontier  instead  of  a  secure  and  acknowledged  one.  She 
has been driven out of the ethnographical, geographical and political circum 
scription  of  her Indian  dominions,  and the  Celestial  Empire  itself  no  longer 
forms  any natural  barrier to  her conquering force.  She  has  lost her point of 
15  gravitation in Asia and pushed into the indefinite.  She is no longer mistress 
of  her  own  movements, there being no  stopping but where the land falls into 
the  sea.  England  seems  thus  to  be  destined  to  open  the  remotest  Orient to 
Western  intercourse,  but  not  to  enjoy  nor  to  hold  it. 

The great colliers' strikes in South Wales not only continue, but out of them 
20 have arisen new strikes among the men employed at the iron mines. A general 
strike  among  the  British  sailors  is  anticipated  for  the  moment  when  the 
Merchant Shipping bill will come into operation, the foreigners being, as they 
say,  admitted  only for the purpose  of lowering their wages. The importance 
of the present strikes, to which I have repeatedly called the attention of your 
25 readers, begins now to be understood even by the London middle-class press. 

Thus,  The  Weekly  Times of last  Saturday  remarks: 

"The  relations  between  employer  and  employed  have  been  violently dis 
turbed.  Labor  throughout  the  length  and  breadth  of  the  land has  bearded 
capital,  and  it  may  safely be  asserted  that the  quarrel thus  evoked  has  only 
just commenced. The working classes have been putting forth strong feelers 
to  try  their  position.  The  agitation  at  present  is  limited  to  a  series  of  inde 
pendent  skirmishes,  but  there  are  indications  that  the  period  is  not  very 
distant  when  this  desultory  warfare  will  be  turned  into  a  systematic  and 
universal  combination  against  capital."

Sir—Messrs.  Herzen  and  Golovine  have  chosen  to  connect  the  New  Rhenish 
Gazette,  edited by  me in  1848  and 1849, with the polemics going on between 
them  and  "F.M.,"  with regard to Bakunin.  They  tell the  English public that 
the  calumny  against  Bakunin  took  origin  in  that  paper,  which  had  even 
ventured  to  appeal  to  the  testimony  of  George  Sand.  Now,  I  care  nothing 
about  the  insinuations  of  Messrs.  Herzen  and  Golovine.  But,  as  it  may 
contribute  to  the  settlement of  the question raised about Michael Bakunin,  10 
permit  me  to  state  the  real  facts  of  the  case: 

5 

On  July  5th,  1848,  the  New Rhenish  Gazette  received  two  letters  from 
Paris—the  one being the authographic correspondence of the Havas-Bureau, 
and  the  other  a  private  correspondence,  emanating  from  a  Polish  refugee, 
quite  unconnected  with that concern—both  stating that George  Sand was  in  15 
possession  of  papers  compromising  Bakunin  as  having  lately  entered  into 
relations  with  the  Russian  Government. 

The  New  Rhenish  Gazette,  on  July  6th,  published  the  letter  of  its  Paris 

correspondent. 

Bakunin, on his part, declared in the Neue Oder Zeitung (a Breslau paper), 20 

that, before the appearance of the Paris correspondence in the New Rhenish 
Gazette,  similar  rumours  had  been  secretly  colported  at  Breslau,  that they 
emanated  from  the  Russian embassies,  and that  he  could  not better  answer 
them,  than  by  appealing  to  George  Sand.  His  letter  to  George  Sand  was 
published  simultaneously with his declaration.  Both the declaration and the  25 
letter  were  reprinted  immediately  by  the  New Rhenish  Gazette,  (vide  New 
Rhenish Gazette, July 16,1848). On August 3,1848, the New Rhenish Gazette 

310 

Michael  Bakunin.  To  the  Editor  of  "The  Morning  Advertiser" 

received  from  Bakunin,  through  the  means  of  M. Koscielski,  a  letter  ad 
dressed by  George  Sand to its  editor, which was published on the  same day, 
with  the  following  introductory  remarks:— 

"In  number  36,  of  this  paper,  we  communicated  a rumour  circulating  in 
5  Paris,  according to  which George Sand was  stated to be possessed of papers 
which  placed  the  Russian  refugee,  Bakunin,  in  the  position  of  an  agent  of 
the  Emperor  Nicholas.  We  gave  publicity to this  statement, because it was 
communicated  to  us  simultaneously  by  two  correspondents  wholly uncon 
nected  with  each  other.  By  so  doing,  we  only accomplished the  duty  of the 
10 public press, which has severely to watch public characters. And, at the same 
time  we gave  to  Mr.  Bakunin  an  opportunity  of  silencing  suspicions thrown 
upon  him  in  certain  Paris  circles.  We  reprinted  also  from  the  Nieue  Oder 
Zeitung,  Mr.  Bakunin's  declaration,  and his  letter addressed to George Sand, 
without waiting for his request. We publish now a literal translation of alerter 
15 addressed to the Editor of the New Rhenish Gazette, by George Sand, which 

perfectly  settles  this  affair."—(Vide  New Rhenish  Gazette, Aug. 3,1848.) 

In  the  latter  part  of  August,  1848,1  passed  through  Berlin,  saw Bakunin 
there,  and  renewed  with  him  the  intimate friendship  which united us before 
the  outbreak  of  the  revolution  of  February. 

20  In  its  number  of  October  13,1848,  the  New  Rhenish  Gazette  attacked  the 
Prussian  ministry  for  having  expelled  Bakunin,  and  for  having  threatened 
him  with  being  delivered  up  to  Russia  if  he  dared  to  re-enter  the  Prussian 
States. 

25 

In  its  number  of  February  15,1849,  the  New Rhenish  Gazette brought out 
a  leading  article  on  Bakunin's  pamphlet—"Aufruf  an  die  Slaven,"  which 
article  commenced  with  these  words—"Bakunin  is  our Mend.  This  shall not 
prevent  us  from  subjecting  his  pamphlet  to  a  severe  criticism." 

In  my letters, addressed to the New  York Daily Tribune, on  "Revolution 
and Contre-revolution in Germany," I was, as far as I know, the first German 
30  writer who  paid to Bakunin the tribute due to him for his participation in our 
movements,  and,  especially in the Dresden insurrection,  denouncing,  at the 
same  time,  the  German press  and  the  German people for the most cowardly 
manner  in  which  they  surrendered  him  to  his  and  their  enemies. 

35 

As  to  "F.M." proceeding, as he does, from the fixed idea, that continental 
revolutions  are  fostering  the  secret  plans  of  Russia,  he  must, if he pretend 
to  anything  like  consistency,  condemn  not  only  Bakunin,  but  every  con 
tinental  revolutionist  as  a  Russian  agent.  In  his  eyes  revolution  itself is  a 
Russian  agent.  Why  not  Bakunin?

Rise in the Price  of Corn—Cholera—Strikes-

Correspondence  of  The  N.Y.Tribune. 

London, Tuesday, Aug.  30,  1853. 

The  Breslaw  Gazette  states  that  the  exportation  of  corn from Wallachia is 
definitively  prohibited. 

5 

There  is  at  this  moment  a  somewhat  greater  question  at  issue  than  the 
Eastern  one,  viz:  the  question  of  subsistence.  Prices  of  corn have  risen  at 
Königsberg,  Stettin, Dantzic, Rostock, Cologne, Hamburg, Rotterdam, and 
Antwerp,  and of course  at all importing markets. At the principal provincial 
markets  in  England  wheat has advanced from 4 to 6s. per qr. The constantly 
increasing  prices  of  wheat  and  rye  in  Belgium  and  France,  and  the  con 
sequent  dearness  of  bread,  create  much  anxiety.  The  French  Government 
is  buying  up  grain  in  England,  at  Odessa,  and in the  Baltic.  The conclusive 
report of the  crops in England will not be out before next week. The potatoe  15 
disease  is  more  general  here  than in  Ireland.  The  export  of  grain  has  been 
prohibited  by  all  Italian  Governments,  including  that  of  Lombardy. 

io 

Some  cases  of  decided Asiatic cholera occurred in London during the last 

week.  We  also  hear that the  cholera has  now  reached  Berlin. 

The  battle  between  labor  and  capital,  between  wages  and  profits,  con-  20 

tinues.  There  have been new  strikes  in London on the part of the coal-heav 
ers, of the barbers, of the tailors, ladies' boot and shoe makers, umbrella and 
parasol  coverers,  shirtmakers  and  makers  of  underclothing  generally,  and 
of  other  working  people  employed  by  slopsellers  and  wholesale  export-
houses.  Yesterday,  a  strike  was  announced  from  several  bricklayers,  and  25 
from  the  Thames  lightermen,  employed  in the  transit of  goods  between the 
wharfs  and  ships  in  the  river.  The  strikes  of  the  colliers  and  iron-workers 

312 

i 

Rise  in  the  Price  of  Corn—Cholera—Strikes—Sailors'  Movement 

in  South  Wales  continues,  and  a  new  strike  of  colüers  in  Resolven  has  to 
be  added  to  the  list,  etc.,  etc. 

It  would  be  tedious  to  go  on enumerating,  letter  after letter,  the  different 
strikes  which  come  to  my  knowledge  week  after  week.  I  shall  therefore 
5  merely  dwell  occasionally  on  such  as  offer  peculiar  features  of  interest, 
among  which, though  not yet  exactly  a  strike,  the  pending  conflict  between 
the  police-constables  and  their  chief,  Sir  Richard  Mayne,  deserves  to  be 
mentioned.  Sir Richard  Mayne, in his circular addressed to the several divi 
sions  of the metropolitan police force, has prohibited policemen from holding 
10  meetings,  or  combining,  while  he  professed  himself  willing  to  attend  to 
individual  complaints.  The  policemen  respond  to  him that they consider the 
right  of  meeting  to  be  inalienable  from  Englishmen.  He  reminds  them that 
their  scale  of wages  was  struck at a time when provisions were much dearer 
than they  are  at present.  The  men reply  that  "their claim is not grounded on 
the price of provisions only, but that it rests on the assurance that flesh and 
blood  are  not  so  cheap  as  they  have  been." 

15 

25 

The  most important incident in this  history of  strikes is the declaration of 
the  "Seamen's  United  Friendly  Association,"  calling itself the Anglo-Saxon 
Sailor's  Bill  of  Rights. This declaration refers to the Merchant Shipping Bill, 
20  which repeals  the  clause  of the  Navigation  Act,  rendering  it imperative  on 
British  owners  to  carry  at  least  three-fourths  of  British  subjects  on  board 
their  ships;  which bill now throws open the coasting trade to foreign seamen 
even  where  foreign  ships  are  excluded.  The  men declare  this  bill to  be, not 
a  Seamen's  bill  but  an  Owners  bill.  Nobody  had  been  consulted  but  the 
ship-owner.  The  manning  clause  had  acted  as  a  check  on  the  conduct  of 
masters  in  the  treatment  and  retention  of  crews.  The  new law would place 
seamen completely in the  power of any bad officer. The new law proceeded 
upon the  principle  "that the  17,000 masters were all men of kind disposition, 
overflowing with generosity, benevolence and amiability; and that all seamen 
30  were untractable, unreasonable and naturally bad." They declare that while 
the  owner  may  take  his  ships  wherever  he  pleases,  their labor is restricted 
to  their  own  country,  as  the  Government  has  repealed  the  Navigation  law 
without first procuring reciprocal employment for them  in the  ships of other 
nations.  "Parliament  having  offered  up  the  seamen  as  a  holocaust  to  the 
35  owners, we  as  a class  are constrained to combine and take measures for our 
own  protection."  These  measures  consist  chiefly  in  the  intention  of  the 
seamen  to  uphold  on  their  part  the  maiming clause,  it being  declared  at  the 
same  time  "that the  seamen  of the  United  States  of  America be  considered 
as  British;  that  an  appeal  be  made  to  them  for  aiding their union;  and that, 
40  as  there  would  be  no  advantage  to  sail  as  an  Englishman  after the  first  of 
October, when the above law will be passed ; as on the contrary freedom from 

313 

Karl  Marx 

impressment  or  service  in  Her  Majesty's Navy during war might be  secured 
by  serving  as  foreigners  in  British  ships  during peace,  and  as  there  would 
be  more  protection  during peace by possessing the freedom of America, the 
seamen  will procure  certificates  of  the  United  States  citizenship,  on  arrival 
at  any  port  of  that  Republic."

my  reply  to  it. 

London,  September  7th. 

Yours  truly, 

Dr.  Karl  Marx. 

io 

H ow  to  W r i te  H i s t o r y .— 

By  a  Foreign  Correspondent. 

"Bakunin  is  a Russian agent—Bakunin  is  not a Russian  agent.  Bakunin  died 
in  the  prison  of  Schlüsselburg  after  having  endured  much  ill-treatment— 
Bakunin  is  not  dead:  he  still  Uves.  He  is  made  a  soldier  and  sent  to  the 
15  Kaukasus—no  he is  not  made  a  soldier:  he  remains  detained  in  the  Citadel 
of  St.  Peter  and  St.  Paul.  Such  are  the  contradictory news which the press 
has  given  us  in  turn  concerning  Michael  Bakunin. 

In these days of extensive publicity, we only arrive at the true by affirming 
the  false,  but,  has  it  at  least  been  proved  that  Bakunin  has  not been in the 

20  military pay  of  Russia? 

There  are  people  who  do  not  know  that  humanity  makes  men  mutually 
responsible—that  in  extricating  Germany  from  the  influence  which  Russia 
exercises  on  it,  we  react  upon  the  latter  country,  and  plunge  it  anew  into 
its despotism, until it becomes vulnerable to revolution. Such people it would 
25  be  idle  to  attempt to  persuade  that  Bakunin is  one  of  the  purest  and most 

generous  representatives  of  progressive  cosmopoütism. 

315 

Karl  Marx 

'Calumniate,  calumniate,'  says  a  French proverb,  'something will  always 
remain.'  The  calumny  against  Bakunin,  countenanced in  1848  by  one  of his 
friends,  has  been  reproduced  in  1853  by  an  unknown  person. 

'One  is  never betrayed but by one'sown connexion,'says another proverb; 
'and  it  is  better  to  deal  with  a  wise  enemy,  than  with  a  stupid  friend.'  The 
conservative  journals  have  not become  the organ of the calumny insinuated 
against  Bakunin.  A  friendly  journal  undertook  that  care. 

5 

Revolutionary  feeling  must  be  but  slightly  developed,  when  it  can  be 
forgotten  for  a  moment,  as  Mr.  Marx  has  forgotten,  that Bakunin is  not of 
the  stuff  of  which police  spies  are made. Why, at least, did he not do, as is  10 
the  custom  of  the  English  papers—why  did  he  not  simply  publish the Jetter 
of  the  Polish  refugee,  which  denounced  Bakunin?  He  would  have  retained 
the  regret  of  seeing  his  name  associated  with  a false  accusation!" 

T he  F o r e i gn  C o r r e s p o n d e nt 

in  S a t u r d a y 's  " M o r n i ng  A d v e r t i s e r ." 

15 

" ' It  is  better  to  deal with a wise  enemy  than a  stupid  friend.'  Exactly  so. 

Is  he  not  a  'stupid  friend'  who is  astonished  at the  discovery, that  a con 
troversy  involves  antagonistic  opinions,  and  that  historical  truth  cannot be 
extricated  but  from  contradictory  statements? 

Is  he  not  a  'stupid  friend'  who  thinks  necessary  to  find  fault  with  ex-  20 

planations  in  1853,  with  which  Bakunin  himself  was  satisfied  in  1848,  to 
'plunge  Russia  anew  in  its  despotism,'  from  which  she  has  never  emerged, 
and  to  call  French  a  trite  Latin  proverb? 

Is  he  not  a  'stupid  friend'  who  assures  a  paper  to  have  'countenanced' a 

statement made by its Foreign Correspondent and unmarked by its editor? 

25 

Is  he  not  a  'stupid  friend'  who  sets  up  'conservative  journals'  as  models 
for 'revolutionary feeling' at its highest pitch, invented the lois des suspects, 
and  suspected  the  'stuff  of  a  traitor  even  in  the  Dantons,  the  Camille 
Desmoulins,  and  the  Anacharsis  Cloots,  who  dares  attack third  persons  in 
the  name  of  Bakunin,  and  dares  not defend  him  in  his  own name? 

30 

In conclusion, let me  tell the friend of proverbial common place that I have 

now  done  with  him  and  with  all  such  like  friends  of  Bakunin."

When  I  told  you  in  my  letter  of  August  30,  that  the  Vienna  Note  was  "re 
jected"  by  the  Porte,  inasmuch  as  the  alterations  demanded  by it  and the 
condition of immediate and previous evacuation cannot be considered other 
wise than as  a refusal of Russia's pretensions, I found myself in contradiction 
with the  whole Press, which assured us that the alterations were insignificant, 
not worth  speaking of,  and that the whole  affair might be regarded as settled. 
Some  days later,  The Morning Chronicle startled the confiding stockjobbers 

10  with the  announcement that the  alterations  proposed by  the  Porte  were of 
a  very  serious  character,  and  by  no  means  easy  to  be  dealt  with.  At  this 
moment  there  exists  only  one  opinion,  namely  that  the  whole  Eastern 
Question  has  come  back  to  its  point  of  issue,  an  impression  in  no  way 
impaired  by  the  complete  publication  in  yesterday's  papers,  of  the  official 
15  Note addressed by Rescbid Pasha, to the Representatives of Austria, France, 

Great  Britain,  and  Prussia,  dated  August  19,  1853. 

20 

25 

That  the  Russian  Emperor  will  reject  the  Turkish  "alterations"  there  is 
not the  slightest  doubt.  Already  we  are  informed  by  the  Assemblée Natio 
nale,  the  Paris  Moniteur  of  the  Emperor  of  Russia,  that,  "according  to 
correspondences received to-day at Paris, the first impressions produced on 
the  Cabinet  of  St.  Petersburg  were  by  no  means  favorable  to  the  modi 
fications  proposed  by  the  Porte.  Whatever  may  be  the  resolution  of  that 
Cabinet  we  must  prepare  ourselves  beforehand  to  take  it  coolly  and  to 
repress  our  fears.  We  have  to  consider that  even were the Russian  Cabinet 
to refuse  the  proposed  change  of the note, there would remain the resource 
of fresh negotiation at Constantinople." The intimation contained in this  last 
hint,  that  Russia  will  attempt  to  gain  another  delay  of  the  decision  of  the 
dispute  is  confirmed  by  the  Berlin  Lithographic  Correspondence:  "The 
Austrian  government  has  presented  a  memorial  to  the  Emperor  Nicholas 

317 

Karl  Marx 

containing  new propositions of modification, and it has undertaken to termi 
nate  the  crisis  in  a  manner  quite  different  from  all  previous  attempts."  In 
a  letter  published  by  the  Vienna  Wanderer  from  Odessa  dated  26th  Aug.  the 
solution of the  Oriental  question is  stated  "to be  not  so near  at hand  as was 
expected by  some  people.  The  armaments have not been suspended for one 
day, and the army in the Principalities continually receives reinforcements." 
The  Cronstadt  Satellite  positively  announces  that  the  Russian  troops  will 
take  up  their  winter-quarters  in  the  PrincipaHties.

been reprinted in a number of German journals you may consider the follow- 
ing  passage  from  an  article  of  the  Berlin  Lithographic  Correspondence  as 
partly  addressed  to  you:  "Some  time  since  the  press  has  had  various  occa 
sions  to  pronounce  itself  on  the  United  States  theory  with  regard  to  inter 
vention.  Very  recently  the  Koszta  affair  at  Smyrna  has  renewed  the  dis 
cussion, and this affair is not yet terminated, when already foreign and native 
journals  hold  out  the  prospect  of  an  intervention  on the part of  the  United 
States in favor of  Switzerland, if it  should be threatened by an attack. To-day 
we  are informed that several Powers have the intention of making a collective 
declaration against the  doctrine  of international right put forth by the United 
States,  and  that  we  may  hope  to  see  those  Cabinets  arrive  at  a  perfect  25 
understanding.  If  the  American  intervention  theories  were  not  refuted  in  a 
peremptory  manner,  the extirpation  of the revolutionary spirit in Europe 
would meet with an insuperable obstacle. We may add, as an important fact, 
that  France  is  among the  Powers ready to participate in this remonstrance." 
On  this  last  point,  the  Constitutionnel of  Tuesday  last  takes  good  care  not 
to  leave  any doubt, when it says:  "It is  necessary to  be  candid in all things. 
It  is  not  as  a  citizen  of  the  United  States  that  Koszta  is  defended  against 
Austria  by  the  agents  of  the  American Republic, but as  a revolutionist.  But 
none  of  the  European  Powers  will  ever  admit  as  a  principle  of  public  law 
that the  Government of the  United States has the right to protect revolution  35 
in  Europe  by  force  of  arms.  On no grounds  would it be permitted to throw 
obstacles in the way of the exercise of the jurisdiction of a government, under 
the  ridiculous  pretense  that  the  offenders  have  renounced their  allegiance, 
and  from  the  real  motive  that  they  are  in  revolt  against  the  political  con 
stitution of their country. The Navy of the American Union might not always  40 
have  such  an  easy  triumph,  and  such  headstrong  conduct  as  that pursued

The  Impartial of  Smyrna,  received  to-day,  publishes  the  following  inter 

esting  letters  from  Schumla: 

"Schumla, Aug.  8,  1853. 
The  Commander-in-Chief,  Omer  Pasha,  has  so  ably  distributed  his  troops, 
that on the first emergency, he may within 24 hours concentrate  at any point 
on  the  Danube,  a  mass  of  65,000  men, infantry  and cavalry,  and  180 pieces 
of  cannon.  A  letter  I received from Wallachia,  states that typhus is  making 
frightful havoc in  the  Russian  army,  and that it has lost  not less  than  13,000 
men  since its  entry into  campaign.  Care  is  taken to bury the dead during the 
night.  The  mortality  is  also  very  high  among  the  horses.  Our  army  enjoys 
perfect  health.  Russian  detachments,  composed  of  30  to  60  soldiers,  and 
dressed in Moldavian uniform, appear from time to time on the opposite bank 
of  the  Danube.  Our  general  is  informed  of  all  their movements.  Yesterday 
1,000 Roman Catholic Albanians  arrived.  They form the vanguard of a corps 
of  13,000  men  expected  without  delay.  They  are  sharpshooters.  Yesterday 
there  arrived also  3,000 horse,  all  of them old  soldiers,  perfectly  armed  and 
equipped.  The  number  of  our  troops  is  increasing every day.  Ahmet Pasha 
started  yesterday  for  Varna.  He  will  wait  there  for  the  Egyptian forces,  in 
order  to  direct  them  to  the  points  they  are  to  occupy." 

30 

"Schumla,  Friday, Aug.  12,  1853. 
On  the  9th  inst.  two regiments  of infantry  and  one battery of light artillery, 
belonging  to  the  guards  of  the  Sultan,  started  for  Rasgrad.  On  the  10th we 
25  got  news  that  5,600  Russians  had  encamped themselves  on the bank of the 
Danube  near  the  port of  Turtukai,  in consequence  of which the  outposts  of 
the  two  armies  are  only  at the  distance  of  a rifle-shot from each  other.  The 
gallant  Colonel  Skander-Bey  has  left  for  that  post,  with  several  officers. 
Omer Pasha has established telegraphs, with a view of having communicated 
to the headquarters at every time of day or night the events passing on every 
point  of  the  river.  We  have had continual rains for  some  days  past, but the 
works  of fortification have  none  the less been continued with great activity. 
A salute of cannon is fired twice a day, at sunrise and sunset. We hear nothing 
of  this  sort  from  the  opposite  side  of  the  river.  The  Egyptian  troops,  after 
35 having undergone their quarantine at Constantinople, will embark for Varna, 
whence  they  are  to  be  directed  to  Babadagh.  The  Brigadier  Izzet  Pasha 
expects  them  there.  In  the  district  of  Dobrudja-Ovassi 20,000  Tartars  have 
assembled, in order to participate in the war  against the  Russians.  They are 
for the  greater  part ancient  emigrants,  who  left the  Crimea at the time of its 

319 

Karl  Marx 

conquest by Russia. The Ottoman army, whose  strength augments every day 
by  the  arrival  of  troops,  both  regular  and  irregular,  is  tired of passiveness, 
and burns with the  desire of going to war. It is to be feared that we shall have 
one  of  these  days  a  transit  across  the  Danube  without  superior  orders, 
especially  now  that the  presence of the Russians,  who  show  themselves  on 
the  opposite bank,  adds to the excitement.  Several physicians, Mussulmans 
and  Christians,  left  some  days  ago,  in  order  to  establish  military  hospitals 
on  the  European  plan  at  Plevna,  at  Rasgrad,  at Widdin,  and at  Silistria.  On 
the  11th there  arrived from  Varna two  superior  English officers. They have 
had  a  long  audience  with  Omer  Pasha,  and  have  visited the  fortifications, 
attended by  several Turkish officers. They have found them in a perfect state 
of  defense,  provided  with  ample  magazines,  baking-stoves,  fountains  of 
fresh  water,  etc.  All  these  fortifications  are  constructed  with  the  greatest 
solidity.  The  most  severe  discipline  prevails  among  our  troops."

"Schumla, Monday, Aug.  15,  1853.  15 

On  the  13th,  the  English  General  O'Donnell  arrived  from  Constantinople. 
He  had  an  interview  of  two  hours'  duration  with  Omer  Pasha,  and  left  on 
the following day,  attended by  an aide-de-camp of the Commander-in-Chief, 
for the purpose of inspecting the fortifications. Yesterday three batteries and 
an  immense  train  of  ammunition  arrived  from  Varna.  To-morrow  a  re-  20 
inforcement  of  one  battery,  two  batalhons  of  infantry,  and  1,000 horse, will 
leave  for the  port  of Hirsova.  The  engineers at this place are busily engaged 
in restoring the fortifications destroyed by the Russians in  1828. Turkey may 
have  unbroken  confidence  in  her  army." 

The  Earl of Fitzwilliam addressed a letter on Thursday last to the meeting  25

was  to  be  placed  on  the  honor  and character  of the  Emperor of Russia." 

Mr.  Disraeli has  summoned  his  constituents  to  meet him  at Aylesbury on 
the  14th  inst.  The  Daily News  of  yesterday  attempted,  in  a long  and dull  30 
article,  to  combat what Mr. Disraeli is  supposed by it to be likely to tell his 
electors.  Such  a  performance  I  tliink  The  Daily  News might  have  left  with 
greater propriety  to  its  venerable  grandsire,  The London Punch. 

It  is  now  the  fourth  time  since  January  that the rate of interest has been 
raised by the Bank of England. On Sept. 4, it was fixed at 4 per cent. "Another  35 
attempt  has  been  made  to reduce  the  ckculating medium  of the  country— 
another  effort to  arrest the tide of national prosperity,"  exclaims  The London 
Sun.  On the other hand, it comforts itself with the consideration that the Bank 
of  England  has  lost  much  of  its  mischievous  power  in  consequence  of  the 
Peel  Act  of  1844. 

320 

Γ 

The  Vienna  Note—The  United  States  and  Europe—Letters  from  Shumla—Peel's  Bank  Act 

The  Sun is  mistaken  in  what  it  fears,  and  in  what  it  hopes.  The  Bank of 
England has  as little  as  any  other bank,  either the  power  of  expanding or of 
contracting  the  currency  of  the  country.  The  really  mischievous  powers 
possessed by  it are by no means restricted, but on the contrary  strengthened 
by  the  Peel  Act  of  1844. 

5 

As the  Bank Act  of  1844 is  generally  misunderstood,  and  as  its working 
will  become,  in  the  approaching  crisis,  of  paramount importance  not  only 
to England but to the whole commercial world, I propose briefly to explain 
the  tendency  of  the  act. 

to 

Peel's  Bank  Act  of  1844  proceeds  on  the  assumption  that  the  metallic 
circulation  is  the  normal  one;  that  the  amount  of  the  currency  regulates 
prices;  that  in the  case  of  a purely metallic circulation, the  currency would 
expand,  with  a  favorable  exchange  and  with  an  influx  of bullion,  while  it 
would  be  contracted  by  an  adverse  exchange  and  a  drain of  bullion;  that à 
circulation of bank notes has  exactly to imitate the metallic circulation; that 
accordingly  there  had  to  be  a  degree  of  correspondence  between the  vari 
ations  in the  amount  of bullion  in  the  vaults  of  the  Bank of England and the 
variations  in  the  quantity of  its  notes  circulating among the public;  that the 
issue  of  notes  must  be  expanded  with  a  favorable,  and  contracted  with  an 
20  unfavorable  exchange  ;  lastly,  that  the  Bank  of  England  had  the  control  over 

15 

the  amount  of  its  notes  in  circulation. 

25 

Now  there  is  not one  of  these premises which is  not utterly fallacious  and 
contradictory  to  facts.  Suppose  even  a  purely  metallic  circulation,  the 
amount  of  currency  could  not  determine  prices,  no  more  than  it  could  de-
termine the amount of commercial and industrial transactions; but prices on 
the  contrary  would  determine  the  amount  of  currency  in  circulation.  Un 
favorable  exchanges,  and  a drain of bullion, would not contract even a purely 
metallic  circulation,  as  they  would  not  affect  the  amount  of  currency  in 
circulation,  but  the  amount of currency in reserve,  sleeping in the banks  as 
30  deposits, Or in private hoards. On the other hand, a favorable exchange and 
a concomitant influx  of  bullion,  would augment, not the currency in circula 
tion,  but  the  currency  deposited  with  bankers  or  hoarded  by  private  in 
dividuals.  The  Peel  Act,  therefore,  starting  upon  a  false  conception  of  a 
purely  metallic  circulation,  naturally  arrives  at  a  false  imitation  of  it by  a 
35  paper  circulation.  The  idea itself, that a bank of issue  has a control over the 
amount  of  its  outstanding  notes,  is  utterly  preposterous.  A  bank  issuing 
convertible  notes  or  advancing  notes  generally,  on  commercial  securities, 
has  neither  the  power  of  augmenting  the  natural level  of  circulation  nor  the 
power  to  cripple  it  by  one  single  note.  A bank may certainly issue notes to 
any amount its  customers will  accept; but, if not wanted for circulation, the 
notes  will  be  returned to  it in the  form of  deposits,  or  in  payment for debts, 

40 

321 

Karl  Marx 

or  in  exchange  for  metal.  On  the  other  hand,  if  a  bank  intend  to  forcibly 
contract  its  issues,  its  deposits  would  be  withdrawn  to  the  amount  needed 
for filling up  the  vacuum created  in the circulation. Thus a bank has no power 
whatever  over  the  quantity  of  circulation,  whatever  may  be  its  power  for 
the  abuse  of  other  people's  capital.  Although  in  Scotland  banking  was  practi-  5 
cally  unrestricted  before  1845,  and  the  number  of  banks  had  considerably 
increased  since  1825,  the  circulation  declined,  and  there  was  only  £1  (of 
paper)  per  head  of  population,  while  there  was  in  England  £2  per  head, 
notwithstanding that the whole circulation below £5 was metallic in England 
and paper in Scotland. 

10 

It  is  an  illusion  that  the  amount  of  circulation  must  correspond  to  the 
amount of bullion.  If the bullion  increases  in  the  vaults  of  a bank, that bank 
certainly  tries  by  all  means  to  extend  its  circulation,  but,  as  experience 
teaches,  to  no  purpose.  From  1841—'43, the bullion in the  Bank of  England 
rose  from  £3,965,000  to  £11,054,000,  but its  total  circulation declined from  15 
£35,660,000 to £34,049,000. Thus the Bank of France had, on March 25,1845, 
an  outstanding  circulation  of  256,000,000f.,  with  a  bullion  reserve  of 
234,000,000f.;  but  on  March  25,1846, its circulation was 249,404,000f., with 
a  bullion  reserve  of  only  9,535,000 f. 

It  is  an  assumption  no  less  incorrect,  that  the  internal  circulation  must  20 

diminish in the case of a drain of bullion.  At this  moment, for instance, while 
the  efflux  of  bullion  is  going  on,  $3,000,000  have  been  brought  to  the  mint 
and  added  to  the  circulation  of  the  country. 

But  the  main  fallacy  rests  on  the  supposition  that demand for  pecuniary 
accommodation,  i.e.  loan  of  capital,  must  converge  with  demand for  addi-  25 
tional  means  of  circulation;  as  if  the  greater  amount  of  commercial  trans 
actions  were not effected by bills, checks, bookcredits, clearing-houses, and 
other forms of credit quite unconnected with the  so-called circulation. There 
can  exist  no  better  mode  of  verifying the  faculty  of  Bank-accommodations 
than the market rate of interest, and no more efficient means for ascertaining  30 
the  amount of business  actually done by a Bank, than the return of bills under 
discount.  Let  us  proceed  on  this  twofold  scale  of  measurement.  Between 
March  and  September,  1845,  when with the  speculation-mania the fictitious 
capital  reached  its  utmost  hight  and  the  country  was  inundated  with  all 
possible  enterprises  on  an  immense  scale,  the  rate  of  interest being  nearly  35 
2V2 per cent., the circulation of Bank notes remained nearly stationary, while 
at a later period in  1847, the rate of interest being 4V2 per cent., the price of 
shares having sunk to the lowest ebb, and discredit spreading in all directions, 
the  circulation  of  Bank  notes  reached  its  maximum. 

The  note  circulation  of  the  Bank  of  England  was  £21,152,853  on  the  40 

17th  April;  £19,998,227  on the  15th of  May;  and  £18,943,079  on the 21st of 

322 

ir 

The  Vienna  Note—The  United  States  and  Europe—Letters  from  Shumla—Peel's  Bank  Act 

August,  1847.  But  while  this  falling  off  in  the  circulation  occurred,  the 
market-rate  of  interest  had  declined  from  7  and  8  to  5  per  cent.  From  the 
21st Aug.,  1847, the circulation increased from £18,943,079 to £21,265,188 on 
Oct.  23.  At  the  same time  the  market-rate  of  interest rose  from  5  to  8  per 
cent. On the 30th of August the circulation was £21,764,085, the interest paid 
in  Lombard-st.  amounting  to  10  per  cent.  Take  another  instance:

So  that  the  Banking  accommodation  in  April,  1847,  greater  by  6,000,000 

than that of  Sept.,  1846,  was  carried on with  a less  amount of circulation. 

Having exposed  the  general  principles  of  Peel's  Bank Act,  I come now to 
its  practical  details.  It  assumes  that  £14,000,000  of  bank  notes  form  the 
15  necessary minimum  amount of circulation.  All notes issued by the  Bank of 
England beyond that amount shall be represented by bullion.  Sir Robert Peel 
imagined  he  had  discovered  a  self-acting  principle  for  the  issue  of  notes, 
which would determine  with mechanical accuracy, the amount of the circula 
tion,  and  which would  increase  or  diminish  in  the  precise  degree  in  which 
20 the bullion increased or decreased. In order to put this principle into practice, 
the  Bank  was  divided  into  two  departments,  the  Issue Department and  the 
Banking  Department,  the  former  a  mere  fabric  of  notes,  the latter the true 
Bank,  receiving  the  deposits  of  the  State  and of the public, paying the  divi 
dends,  discounting  bills,  advancing  loans,  and  performing  in  general  the 
25  business  with  the  public,  on the principles  of every other banking concern. 
The  Issue  Department  makes  over  its  notes  to  the  Banking  Department to 
the  amount  of  £14,000,000,  plus  the  amount  of  bullion  in  the  vaults  of  the 
Bank.  The  Banking  Department negotiates  those  notes  with the  public. The 
amount  of  bullion necessary to  cover the notes beyond £14,000,000, remains 
in  the  Issue  Department,  the  rest  being  surrendered  to  the  Banking  De 
partment.  If the amount of bullion diminish beneath the circulation exceeding 
£14,000,000,  the  notes  returning to  the  Banking Department in discharge  of 
its  advances,  or  under  the  form  of  deposits,  are  not reissued nor replaced, 
but  annihilated.  If  there  were  a  circulation  of  £20,000,000,  with  a  metallic 
reserve  of  £7,000,000,  and  if  the Bank were further drained by an efflux of 
£1,000,000,  all the bullion would be  requested by the Issue Department, and 
there  would  not  remain  one  sovereign  in  the  Banking  Department. 

30 

35 

Now  everybody  will  understand  that  this  entire  machinery  is  illusory  on 

the  one  hand,  and  of  the  most  pernicious  character  on  the  other  hand. 

40 

Take,  for  instance, the  Bank returns  in  last  Friday's  Gazette.  There you 

323 

Karl  Marx 

find, under the head of the Issue Department, the  amount of notes in circula 
tion  stated  to  be  £30,531,650,  i.e.,  £14,000,000 + £16,531,650-the  latter  sum 
corresponding  to  the  bullion  reserve  of  last  week.  But  turning  to  the  head 
of  Banking Department,  you  will find £7,755,345  in notes in  its  assets.  This 
is  the  portion  of  the  £30,531,650  not  accepted  by  the  public.  Thus the  self- 
acting  principle  determines  only  the  £30,531,650  in  notes  to be  transported 
from  the  Issue  Department  to  the  Banking  Department.  But  there  they 
remain.  As  soon  as  the  Banking  Department  comes  into  contact  with  the 
public,  the  amount  of  circulation is  regulated,  not by Peel's  Act,  but by the 
wants of business.  The  self-acting principle, accordingly, extends its opera-  10 
tion  not  beyond  the  vaults  of  the  Bank premises. 

5 

On  the  other  hand,  there  occur  moments,  when the  Bank of England, by 
her  exceptional  position,  exercises  a  real  influence,  not  only  on  English 
commerce, but on the  commerce  of the world.  This  happens  in moments of 
general  discredit.  In  such moments the Bank may, by raising in accordance  15 
with  the  Peel  Act,  its  minimum  rate  of  interest,  correspondingly  with  the 
efflux  of bullion,  and by  refusing her accommodation,  depreciate the public 
securities,  lower  the  prices  of  all  commodities,  and  enormously  aggravate 
the  disasters  of  a  commercial  crisis.  It  may,  in  order  to  stop  the  efflux  of 
bullion  and  to  turn the  exchanges,  transform  every  commercial  stagnation  20 
into a monetary peril.  And in this manner the  Bank of England has acted and 
was  forced  to  act  by  the  Peel  Act  in  1847. 

This, however,  is  not all. In every banking concern, the heaviest Uabilities 
are  not  the  amount  of  notes  in  circulation,  but  the  amounts  of  notes  and 
metals  in deposit.  The banks of Holland, for instance, had, as Mr. Anderson  25 
stated  before  a  Committee  of  the  House  of  Commons,  before  1845, 
£30,000,000 in deposit, and £3,000,000 only in circulation.  "In all commercial 
crises,"  says  Mr.  Alex.  Baring,  "for  instance,  in  1825,  the  claims  of  the 
depositors  were  the  most  formidable,  not  those  of  the  holders  of  notes." 
Now,  while  the  act  of  Peel  regulates  the  amount  of  bullion  to  be  held  in  30 
reserve  for  the  convertibility  of  notes,  it  leaves  Directors  the  power  to  do 
with the  deposits as they please.  Yea, more. The very regulations of this act, 
as  I  have  shown,  may  force  the  Banking  Department  to  stop  the  payment 
of  the  deposits  and  of  the  dividends,  while  bullion  to  any  amount  may  lie 
in the  vaults  of  the  Issue Department. This happened, indeed, in  1847. The  35 
Issue Department being yet possessed of £61,000,000 of bullion, the Banking 
Department  was  not  saved  from  bankruptcy  but  by  the  interference  of 
Government  suspending,  on their  responsibility, the  Peel Act,  on 25th Oct., 
1847. 

Thus the result of the Peel Act has been that the Bank of England changed  40 

its  rate  of  interest  thirteen  times  during the  crisis  of  1847,  having  changed 

324 

The  Vienna  Note—The  United  States  and  Europe—Letters  from  Shumla—Peel's  Bank  Act 

it  only  twice  during  the  crisis  of  1825;  that  it  created  amid  the  real  crisis  a 
series  of  money  panics  in  April  and  October,  1847;  and  that  the  Banking 
Department  would  have  been  obliged  to  stop  but for the  stoppage of  the act 
itself.  There  can,  therefore,  exist  no  doubt  that the  Peel  Act will aggravate 
the  incidents  and  severity  of  the  approaching  crisis.

"Lord  Aberdeen  could  never understand  Lord Palmerston's  affectations— 
never  seeing  that  consequent  upon  these  affectations,  Lord  Palmerston  was 
always  able  to promote  unmolested  the  Russian  system,  even  better  than 
Lord  Aberdeen  himself...  Lord  Palmerston  disguises  cynicism  in  Com 
promise  . ..  Lord  Aberdeen  did,  as  Lord  Palmerston  did  not,  express  his  15 
convictions  . ..  Lord  Palmerston  sees  the  expediency,  and  Lord  Aberdeen 
does  not  see  the  expediency  of talking intervention, while  acting non-inter 
vention  . ..  Lord Aberdeen knowing, from his acquaintance with the govern 
ing classes,  how  seats  are  got,  and voters bought,  does  not think the British 
Constitution the most perfect of human institutions ; and, calculating that the 20 
people  of  Continental  Europe  are  not more amiable or more  honest than the 
people of Great Britain,  he abstains from urging on continental governments 
the  desirability of  abolishing paternal despotism  in favor of  self-government 
by  governing  classes  . ..  Lord  Aberdeen  perceives  that  Great  Britain  is  a 
power  made  up  of conquests  over nationalities,  and  scorns  a foreign policy  25 
affecting  to  befriend  struggling  nationalities.  Lord  Aberdeen  does  not  see 
why  England,  which  has  conquered  and  plundered  India,  and  keeps  India 
down  for  India's  good,  should  set  up  for  a  hater  of  Czar  Nicholas,  who  is 

326 

Political  Movements—Scarcity  of  Bread  in  Europe 

a  good  despot in Russia,  and keeps Poland down for Poland's obvious  good. 
Lord  Aberdeen  does  not  see  why  England,  which has  crushed  small rebel 
lions  in  Ireland,  should  be  fanatically  angry with Austria for  keeping down 
Hungary;  and  knowing  that  England  forces  an  alien  Church  on  Ireland,  he 
5  understands  the  eagerness  of  the  Pope  to plant Cardinal Wiseman in West 
minster.  He knows that we have had  Kaffir wars and does not think Nicholas 
a ruffian for thinning his  army among the Caucasians ; he knows that we send 
off  periodically,  rebellious  Mitchells  and  O'Briens  to  Van  Diemen's  land, 
and  does  not  feel  horror  because  Louis  Napoleon  institutes  a  Cayenne. 
10  Whenever  he  has  to  write  to  the  Neapolitan  Government  about  Sicilian 
affairs, he  does  not plunge into ecstatic liberalism, because he bears in mind 
that  Great  Britain  has  a  proconsul  at  Corfu  . ..  It  is  a happy  arrangement, 
a  Coalition  Government,  which  includes,  with  Lord  Aberdeen  acting the 
Russian,  Lord  Palmerston  to  iaZfcthe  Bermondsey  policy."

As  a proof that I  have  not undervalued the heroism of Switzerland, I may 
allege  a letter  addressed by its  Federal Council to the Ticinese Government, 
contending  that  "the  affair  of  the  Capuchins  is  purely  a  Cantonal  question, 
and  that  consequently  it  is  for  the  Canton  of  Ticino  to  consider  whether it 
is  better  for  it  to  resist,  and  continue  subject  to  the  rigorous  measures  of 
20  Austria,  or  to  make  to  the  Government offers  of renewal of négociations." 
Thus it appears that the Swiss Federal Council tries to bring down its dispute 
with  Austria  within  the  proportions  of  a  simple  Cantonal  affair.  The  same 
Council has just ordered the expulsion of the  Italians, Clementi, Cassola and 
Grillanzoni,  after  the  Jury  at  Chur  had  acquitted  them  from  the  charge  of 
25  having  abetted  the  Milan insurrection by the  forwarding of arms  across  the 

Ticinese  frontier. 

The  British  support to  Juggernaut appears not yet to have been altogether 
done  away  with.  On  the  5th  of  May,  1852,  the  following  dispatch  was  ad 
dressed  by  the  Court  of  Directors  to  the  Governor  of  India: 

30 

"We  continue  to  be  of  opinion that  it  is  desirable  finally  to  dissever  the 
British  Government  from  all  connection  with the  temple,  and  we therefore 
authorize to  make  arrangements for accomplishing this  object by the discon 
tinuance of any periodical allowance to it, in lieu of which some final payment 
may  be  made  in  the  way  of  compensation  to  any persons  who  may  appear 
35  upon  a  Uberai  construction  of  past  engagements  or  understandings  to  be 

entitled  to  such  indemnifications." 

On  the  11th  April,  1853,  however,  nothing had  been  done  by  the  Indian 

Government,  the  subject  being  still  under  consideration  at  that  date. 

A  week  has  been  consumed  in  a  government  inquiry  into  the  cruelties 
40  practised  upon  the  prisoners  in  Birmingham  jail,  cruelties  which  have  in 
duced  several  of them  to  commit and  others  to  attempt  suicide.  Startled on 

327 

Karl  Marx 

one  side  by  an  exposition  of  atrocities  not  surpassed by  any  committed  in 
an Austrian or Neapolitan  carcere duro, we are on the other side  surprised 
at  the  tame  acquiescence  of  the  visiting  magistrates  in  the  representations 
which  were  made  to  them  by  interested  parties,  and  at  their  utter  want  of 
sympathy with the victims.  Their  solicitude for the barbarous goaler was so 
great  that  they  regularly  forewarned  him  of  their  approaching  visits.  The 
chief  culprit,  Lieutenant  Austin,  is  one  of  those  persons  whom  Carlyle 
designated  in  his  "Model  Prisons"  as  the  true  officers  of  the  pauper  and 
criminal.

One  of  the  topics  of  the  day  is  Railway morality.  The  Yorkshire  and  10 

Lancashire  Board  of  Directors  particularly  announce  on  their  tickets  that 
"whatever  accident  may  happen,  whatever  injury  may  be  inflicted  through 
their  own  negligence  or  that  of  their  servants,  they would hold themselves 
absolved from all legal responsibility." At the  same time the Directors of the 
Birmingham  and  Shrewsbury  line  appeared  before  the  Vice-Chancellor's  15 
Court  on  Saturday for  having cheated  their own  shareholders.  There  exists 
a rivalry between the Great Western and the North-Western lines as to which 
of  the  two  should  absorb  the  above  line  in  question.  The  majority  of  the 
shareholders  being  in  favor  of  amalgamation  with  the  North-Western,  and 
the  Directors  of  absorption into  the  Great Western, it occurred to  the latter  20 
to turn a number of  shares held by them in trust for the Company to account, 
for  the  manufacture  of  fictitious  voters.  For  this  purpose  the  shares  were 
transferred to  a number of nominal holders—in some instances it would seem 
without  the  concurrence  of  the parties whose  names were  used,  and in one 
instance  to  a  child  of  nine  years  of  age—who  paid  no  consideration for the  25 
shares,  but  executed  re-transfers  of  them  into  the  hands  of  the  Directors, 
and supplied them, in virtue of their nominal ownership, with a given number 
of proxies, to  insure  a majority in favor of the union with the Great Western. 
The  learned  Judge  remarked  that  "anything  more  flagrant  or  more  gross 
could  scarcely be conceived, and the way in which the plan had been carried  30 
out was  still more gross." With this reflection he dismissed the guilty parties, 
as  is usual  among the bourgeoisie, while  a poor  devil of  a proletarian would 
have  been  sure  to  be  transported  for  a  theft  beyond  five  pounds. 

It is curious to observe the British public in its fluctuating indignation now 
against the morality of mill lords, and now against the pit-owners, now against 35 
the  little  dealers  in adulterated drugs,  and then against the railwaymen who 
have  supplanted the  obsolete  highwaymen;  in  short,  against the  morality of 
every  particular  class  of  capitalists.  Taking  the  whole,  it  would  seem  that 
capital  possesses  a  peculiar  morality  of  its  own,  a kind  of  superior  law  of 
a  raison  d'état, while  ordinary morals  are  a thing supposed  to  be  good for  40 
the  poor  people.

Manchester  Parliamentary  Reformers  seem  to  be  in  a  pretty  fix.  The 
election  revelations  of  the  last  session  concerned  almost  exclusively  bor 
oughs,  and  even the  great ones,  as  Hull,  Liverpool,  Cambridge  and  Canter 
bury. The Uberai election-broker, Mr. Coppock, confessed in a fit of veracity: 
"What  St. Albans  was  aU other boroughs  are." Now the oUgarchy meditate 
turning  these  exposures  to recount in effecting a reform in favor of counties 
and  at  the  cost  of  boroughs.  The  Manchester  Reformers,  who  desire  no 
general  extension  of  the  suffrage,  but  only  one  within  the  borough-limits, 
are,  of  course,  dumb  under  such a proposition.  It is  pitiful to  see  how  their 

10  organ,  The Daily News,  struggles  to  get out of  this  difficulty. 

On January  14,1846, the  Bank rate  of interest was raised to 3 7 2p er cent.; 
on Jan.  21,1846,  to 4 per cent.;  and it was  not until  April,  1847, that the rate 
rose  to  5 per  cent. ; but it is known that in the last three weeks of April,  1847, 
almost  aU  operations  of  credit  were  at  a  dead-lock.  In  1853,  the  upward 
15  movement of  the  Bank rate  of  interest was  by far  more  rapid.  From  2  per 
cent.,  at which it was  on  24th  April,  1852, it rose to 2V2 per cent,  on Jan.  8, 
1853;  to  3  per cent,  on the  22d of the  same  month,  to  3V2 per cent,  on the 
4th June, to 4 per  cent,  on the  1st of  September, and already the rumor runs 
through the city that it will shortly rise to 5 per cent. In Nov.  1846, the average 
20  price  of  wheat was  56s.  9d.  per qr.;  in the  latter weeks  of  August,  1853,  it 
had  reached  65s.  to  66s.  About this  period last year the  Bank of England 

held in its  cellars 
It  now  holds  only

25 The buUion decreased during last week but one by £208,875, and in last week 
by  £462,850.  The  effect  upon  prices  at  the  Stock  Exchange  has  been  im 
mediate,  every  description  of  security  declining.  We  read  in  the  Money 
article  of  last  Wednesday's  Times: 

30 

"Notwithstanding  the  depression  in  the  Stock  market,  Exchequer  Bills 
remained  at  2  per  cent,  discount to  1  per cent,  premium, but an impression 
is  entertained  that  the  Chancellor  of the  Exchequer,  in order  to  sustain  the 
price,  causes  them  to  be  purchased  on  Government  account,  in the absence 
of  any  funds  immediately  available  for  that  purpose,  by  the  sales  of  3  per 
cent,  stocks  held  on  account  of  Savings  Banks." 

35  This  would  be  a  masterpiece  on  the  part  of  Mr.  Gladstone  :  seUing  Consols 
at a low figure  and  purchasing  Exchequer  Bills  at  a high one,  causing a loss 
of  half  the  income  of  the  3  per  cent,  stocks  by  converting  them  into  Ex 
chequer Bills  bearing Uttle  more than  IV2  per cent,  interest. 

40 

How  can  we  reconcile  an  unfavorable  exchange  or  drain  of  bullion with 
the  unprecedented increase of British exports,  which at the end of the year 
will  surpass  by  £16,000,000  even  the  exports  of  1852? 

329 

Karl  Marx 

"As we give credit to  all the world in the case of our exports and pay ready 
money  in  the  case  of  our  imports,  a  large  expansion  of  our  trade  at  any 
moment  must  necessarily  lead  to  a  considerable  balance  in  the  payments 
against  us  at  the  time, but  which  must  all be  returned  when the  credit upon 
our  exports  has  expired  and  remittances  are  to  be  made  for  them." 

5 

So  says  The  Economist.  According  to  this  theory,  if  the  exports  of  1854 
were to  surpass  again those of 1853, the exchange must continue to be against 
England,  and  a  commercial  crisis  would  be  the  only  means  of  adjustment. 
The  Economistthinks  that  disasters like those  of  1847  are  out of the  question, 
because  no  considerable  portion  of  capital  has  been  fixed  now  as  then,  in  10 
railways, etc.  He forgets that it has been converted into factories, machinery, 
ships, etc.  On the other hand,  The Ofrserverlaments the "foolishinvestments 
in  foreign  railways,  and  other  companies  of  very  doubtful  and  suspicious 
character." The Economist thinks that the extended commercial operations, 
so far as Europe is concerned, may receive a wholesome checkirom the high  15 
price of  corn, but that America and Australia, etc.,  are  sure.  The  Times at 
the  same  time  asserts that the tightness of the New-York money market will 
put a  wholesome check on American operations. "We must not calculate on 
the  same  extent  of  orders  from  the  United  States  that  we  have  hitherto 
experienced,"  exclaims  The  Leader.  Australia  remains.  Here  steps  in  The  20 
Observer: 

"Exports  have  been  pushed  injudiciously  forward.  From  the  74,000 tons 
of  shipping  now  entered  in  London  for  the  Southern  Colonies,  the  con 
demnatory notices we gave from Adelaide, Melbourne, etc., will receive their 
justification.  It  is  not  to  be  denied  that  present  prospects  are  not  promis-  25 
ing." 

As  to  the Chinese market all reports are unanimous on the point that there 
exists  a great  alacrity  to  sell,  but  as  great  a reluctance to buy, the  precious 
metals  being  hoarded,  and  any  alteration of this  state  of things  remains  out 
of  question  as  long  as  the  revolutionary  movement  in  the  monster  Empire  30 
has  not  accomplished  its  end. 
And  the  home  market? 
"Large  numbers  of  the  power-loom-weavers in Manchester and its neigh 
borhood  have  followed the  example of Stockport, in striking for an advance 
of  10 per cent, on their w a g e s . .. The factory hands will probably find, before  35 
the  end of the winter,  that the  question is  not whether  an increase  of  10 per 
cent,  will  be  conceded,  but  whether  the  manufacturers  will  allow  work  to 
be  resumed  at  the  present  rate  of  wages." 

In these  terms,  not to  be  misunderstood,  The Morning Chronicle alludes 

to  the imminent decline  of the  domestic  market. 

40 

I  have  repeatedly  dwelt  on  the  immense  enlargement of  the old factories, 

330 

Political  Movements—Scarcity  of  Bread  in  Europe 

and  the  unparalleled  erection of new ones.  I reported to you upon  some new 
built mills  which form,  as  it were, whole  manufacturing towns.  I  stated that 
at no former epoch had  such a proportion of the floating capital accumulated 
during  the  period  of  prosperity,  been  directly  sunk  for  manufacturing  pur-
5  poses.  Now, take these facts on the one hand, and on the other the symptoms 
of  overstocked  markets  at  home  and  abroad;  remember,  also,  that  an  un 
favorable  exchange  is  the  surest  means  to  precipitate  over-exports  into 
foreign  markets. 

10 

But it is  the  bad  harvest which,  above  all,  will drive the long accumulated 
elements of a great commercial and industrial crisis to eruption. Every other 
sort  of  produce,  when  enhanced,  checks  its  own  demand;  but  Corn,  as  it 
becomes  appreciated,  is  only  the  more  eagerly  sought  for,  drawing  depre 
ciation  on  all  other  commodities.  The  most  civilized  nation,  like  the  most 
brutal  savage,  must procure its food before it can think of procuring anything 
15  else,  and  the  progress  of  wealth  and  civilization  is  generally  in  the  same 
proportion,  in  which  the  labor  and  cost  of  producing  food  diminish.—A 
general bad  harvest is  in itself a general contraction of markets, at home and 
abroad.  Now the  present harvest is  at  least  as  deficient in the  southern part 
of Europe, in Italy,  France, Belgium, Rhenish Prussia, as  it was in 1846—47. 
It is by no means promising in the north-west and north-east. As to England, 
the  Mark-lane Express, that Moniteur oí the London Corn Exchange,  states 
in  its  number  of  yesterday  week: 

20 

25 

"That  the  produce  of  wheat  in  the  United  Kingdom  will  be  the  smallest 
gathered for many years, does  not admit  of  question. The average yield will 
fall materially short in almost all parts of the kingdom, independent of which 
it  must  be  borne  in  mind  that  the  breadth  of  land  sown  was,  owing  to  the 
unpropitious  weather  during  the  seeding  time,  at  least  one  fourth  less  than 
usual." 

This  situation  will  not  be  alleviated  by  the  delusion  of  commercial  con-
30  vulsions, industrial over-production, and bad harvests having been simulta 
neously done  away with by Free  Trade. On the contrary.  "Holders" remarks 
the  same  Mark-lane Express,  "can not yet realize the idea of scarcity under 
Free  Trade.  Hence few  are disposed to hold heavy  stocks. If our necessities 
should  drive  us  hereafter  to  import  largely,  the  chances  are,  that  we  shall 
35  have  to  pay  dearly for  supplies."  The  Mark-lane  Express  of  yesterday 

adds: 

''There  is  still  so  large  a proportion of the crops abroad that the character 
of  the  weather  for  some  weeks  to  come  will have great influence  on trade. 
The  quality  of  the  grain  exposed  in the  fields  has  already  suffered  from  the 
last  rains,  and  a  continuance  of  wet  might  be  productive  of  an  immense 
amount of mischief... The ultimate result of the harvest threatens to be less 

40 

331 

Karl  Marx 

satisfactory than  appeared  likely  a week or two  ago  . .. The  accounts which 
have  reached  us  the last few  days  with regard to potatoes,  are  less  favorable 
than  those  previously  received  . ..  Notwithstanding  the  enormously  large 
supplies  from  abroad  during  last  week,  (88,833  qrs.)  the  reaction  on prices 
has been only  small, the  fall from the highest point not having exceeded Is. 
to  2s.  per  quarter  . ..  The  probable  result  of  the  harvest  in  the  Baltic  is  on 
the  whole  of  an unsatisfactory  character...  According to the latest advices, 
wheat was at 60s. f .o.b. at Dantzig, at 56s. 3d. at Königsberg, 54s. at Stettin, 
58s.  at  Rostock."

The  consequences  of the  dearth are  already appearing,  as in  1847, on the  10 

political  horizon.  At  Naples  the  town  authorities  are  without  means  to 
employ  the  laborers  on  public  works,  and  the  Exchequer  is  unable  to  pay 
the  State  officers.  In  the  Papal  States,  at  Tolentino,  Terni,  Ravenna  and 
Trastevere,  there  have  been bread riots by no means mitigated by the recent 
arrests,  the  invasion  of  the  Austrians,  and  the  threat  of  the  bastinado.  In  15 
Lombardy the political consequences of dearth and industrial stagnation will 
not  be  avoided  by  Count  Strassoldo's  imposing  an  additional  tax  of  6V2 
kreuzer  per  florin,  payable  on  the  20th  Sept.  and  10th  Oct.,  this  year,  and 
to  be  levied  on  all  payers  of  direct  taxes,  including  the  income  tax and  the 
tax upon salaries. The general distress in Austria is betrayed by her lingering  20 
after  a  new  loan,  introduced on the market as  usual by the  assertion that she 
wants the money only to reduce her army. The feverish anxiety of the French 
Government  may be  inferred from  its false harvest accounts, its false assize 
of  bread  at  Paris,  and  its  immense  purchases  of  corn  on  all  markets.  The 
provinces  are  disaffected,  because  Bonaparte  feeds Paris  at their expense;  25 
the  bourgeoisie  are  disaffected  because  he  interferes  with  commerce  in 
behalf  of the  proletarians;  the  proletarians  are  disaffected  because  he  gives 
wheat bread instead  of  brown to  the  soldiers,  at the moment when peasants 
and  workmen  are  menaced  with  the  prospect  of  no  bread  at  all; lastly,  the 
soldiers  are  disaffected  because  of  the  humble  anti-national  attitude  of  30 
France  in  the  Eastern  question.  In Belgium  several food-riots  have  echoed 
the  foolish festivities  lavished by the  Coburgs on the Austrian Archduchess. 
In  Prussia  the  fear  of the  Government is  so  great that  several  corn-brokers 
have  been  arrested  by  way  of  show,  and  the  rest  summoned  before  the 
Police-President,  who  "requested"  them  to  sell  at  "honest"  prices. 

35 

I  conclude  by  again  recording  my  opinion,  that  neither  the  declamation 
of  the  demagogues,  nor  the  twaddle  of  the  diplomats  will  drive  matters  to 
a  crisis,  but  that  there  are  approaching  economical  disasters  and  social 
convulsions  which  must  be  the  sure  fore-runners  of  European  revolution. 
Since  1849 commercial and industrial prosperity has stretched the lounge on  40 
which  the  counter-revolution  has  slept  in  safety.

London, Tuesday,  Sept.  20,  1853. 

In  my  letter  of  July  19,1  said: 

"The  Western  Powers  commence by  encouraging  the  Sultan  to  resist  the 
5 Czar, from fear of the encroachments of Russia, and terminate by compelling 
the former to yield, from fear of a general war giving rise to a general revolu 
tion." 

Now,  at  this  moment  the  strength  of  the  combined  fleets  is  intended  to 
be  used  for  Russia  against  Turkey.  If  the  Anglo-French  fleet  enter  the 
10  Dardanelles  at all,  it will be  done  not to bombard  Sebastopol, but to  reduce 
to  terms  the  Mussulmans  who  might  prevent  the  Sultan  from  accepting 
without conditions  the  Vienna  Note. 

"On  the  13th  of  September,"  says  D. Urquhart,  "the four  Foreign Secre 
taries  quietly  assembled  in  Downing-st.,  and  decided  to  send  orders  to 
15  Constantinople  to  enforce  upon  the  Porte  the  withdrawal  of  the  modi 
fications  which  the  European  Conference  had  accepted.  Not  content  with 
this,  and in case  the  Sultan should find himself unable  to  resist the exaspera 
tion  of  his  people,  they  sent  orders  for  the  squadron  to  advance  into  the 
waters  of  the  Bosphorus  to  support  him  against  his  subjects.  Nor  content 
20  with  this,  they  also  dispatched  orders  to  Omar  Pacha  to  forbid  him  from 
passing  from  one  province  to  another  in  his  Sovereign's  Dominions.  They 
have consequently contemplated the rebellion as the result of their dispatch, 
and  provided  means  for  putting it down, these means being the allied  squad 
ron." 

25 

It was from  Sunday's Journal des Débats that the English public became 
acquainted  with  this  news.  The  Journal  des  Débats  stated  that  Mr.  Reeve, 
having  left  London  on  the  13th  inst.,  with  dispatches  for  Lord  Stratford  de 
Redcliffe,  arrived  in  Paris  on  the  morning  and  left  it  on  the  evening  of the 
14th,  after  he  had  communicated  to the  French Government the tenor of his 

333 

Karl  Marx 

5 

instructions,  ordering the English Ambassador to demand the entire adhesion 
of  the  Porte  to  the  Vienna  proposals,  the  retraction  of  its  modifications  of 
the  19th August, threatening it with the  withdrawal of the  support of the four 
Powers  in  the  event  of  a war  arising from  her  refusal  to  yield,  and  offering 
it  the  assistance  of  the  French  and  English  fleets  for  putting  down  any 
insurrection  that  might  break  out  in  Constantinople  if  the  Porte  were  to 
comply  with  the  Vienna  Note,  and  against  Omar  Pacha,  if  he  dared  to  act 
in  disobedience  to  the  orders  of  the  Porte.  Before  the  arrival of  the  Journal 
des Débats, we  were  informed that the  Vienna  Conference,  on receipt  of the 
Emperor's  refusal,  sent  proposals  to  the  Sultan  that  he  should  recall  his 
words,  that  he  should  sign  the  note  he  had  refused  to  sign,  and be  content 
with  an  assurance  that  the  Conference  would  put  any  interpretation  on the 
note  agreeable  to  the  Sultan  himself.  The  Times  avoids  speaking  of  the 
compromising  revelations  made  by  the  Journal  des  Débats.  So  does  The 
Morning Chronicle, The Morning Post, and the whole of the governmental  15 
London press. In the meantime The Morning Post denounces the fanaticism 
of the Constantinople mob, The Morning Chronicle is exciting its dull readers 
by  romantic  descriptions  of  the  fierce  and  undisciplined  Asiatic  hordes 
inundating  European  Turkey,  and  swelling  Omar Pacha's  army;  the gallant 
Globe  publishes  day  after  day  carefully  selected  extracts  from  the  peace- 
mongering press  of the Manchester school, and, in due time, the respectable 
classes  of  England  will  be  prepared  "to  annihilate  Paganism,"and  to  shout 
with  Prince  Gortchakoff,  "Long  life  to  the  Czar!  Long life to  the  God of the 
Russians!"

In its to-day's number The Times discovers that "the Turkish question has 25 

plainly  become  a  question  of  words;" the  inference  to  be  drawn  from  its 
premises  being,  that the  Sultan who intends exposing the peace of the world 
for  mere  words,  must  be  forcibly  brought  to  reason  by  the  more  sober-
minded  Palmerstons  and  Aberdeens.  The  Czar,  we  are  told  by  The  Times, 
having preferred unjust demands upon the Sultan, the Sultan rejected them,  30 
the  Czar  seized  the Danubian Principalities, England and France  dispatched 
their fleets to Besika Bay,  and the representatives of these Powers met those 
of  Austria  and  Prussia  in  Vienna. 

Why did  they meet them  in Vienna? In favor of Turkey,  says  The  Times. 
"Not  only  could there  be  no  desire  of coercing the  Ottoman  Government,  35 
but there was  no occasion for such an action." If, then, there is now a desire 
on  the  part  of  the  four  Powers  for  coercing the  Ottoman  Government,  "it 
is  simply  because  there  is  now"  an  occasion for  "such  an  action."  Would 
it  then  be  wrong  to  suppose  that  the  sole  and  principal  aim  of  the  Vienna 
Conference  and  of  the  interference  of  Palmerston  and  Aberdeen  has  been  40 
the  affording  such  an  occasion,  that  they  made  only  a  show  of  resistance 

334 

The  Western  Powers  and  Turkey—Imminent  Economic  Crisis—Railway  Construction  in  India 

to  Russia,  in order  to  gain  a pretext for  coercing Turkey  into  submission to 
her? 

"The  demands  of  Russia,"  continues  The  Times,  were  "thought  un 
justifiable by  the  other  great Powers, incompatible with the  sovereign rights 
5  of  the  Sultan,"  and  therefore,  the  great Powers  drew  up  a Note  to  be  pre 
sented  by  the  Sultan  to  the  Czar,  ratifying  all the  demands  of the  Czar and 
something more. "The terms of this document,"  says  The  Times, "were liable 
to misconstruction,  but,  two  points  were  unimpeachably  clear—first,  that the 
four  Powers  intended  to  maintain  the  territorial  and administrative rights of 
10 the Porte; and, next, that in the event of dispute they would have been bound 

by  this intention." 

15 

Why  should  the  Sultan  not  subscribe  a note,  derogatory of  his  sovereign 
rights  and  surrendering  the  protectorate  of  twelve  millions  of  his  subjects 
to  the  control  of  the  autocrat,  while  he  feels  himself  backed  by  the  good 
"intentions" of  the  four  Powers  and  by  their  being  bound by  hidden  "good 
intentions"  in the case  of  a dispute? As  the  Sultan has  had occasion to  learn, 
the  four  Powers  feel  themselves  not  bound  either by the  law of nations,  or 
by  explicit treaties,  to  defend him in the event of a dispute with Russia; why 
should  he  not trust to their valor in the event of a dispute arising from a note 
20  which  endows  Russia  with  open  claims  and  Turkey  with  "hidden  in 

tentions?" 

"Let us  take,"  says  The  Times,  "the extreme  case of  supposing that,  after 
the  acceptance  pure  et  simple  of  the  original  Vienna  note,  the  Czar  should 
have  availed  himself  of  those  opportunities  with  which  the  note is  thought 
to have provided him." What then? " The Sultan  would have protested, and 
the  case  would  have  arisen  from  the  application of the  adjustment of  1853." 
As  if there had arisen no case from the application of the adjustment of  1840 
and  1841,  of  the  treaty  of  Balta-Liman,  and  of  the  violation  of  the  law  of 
nations, characterized by Lord Clarendon himself as "an act of piracy !" "The 
ambiguity,"  says  The  Times,  "would  merely  have  misled  the  Emperor  of 
Russia." Exactly so, as the treaty of 1841 has "misled" him to keep the united 
fleets  out  of  the  Dardanelles  while  he  himself  entered  the  Principalities. 

25 

30 

The  Sultan,  however,  is  stiff-necked.  He  has  refused  compliance  with  a 
note  which  was  able  to  express  its  good  intentions  for  Turkey  only  by 
35  delivering her up to Russia.  He proposed certain modifications in this note, 
and  "the  four  Powers,"  says  The  Times,  "showed  by  their  approval  of  the 
Turkish  modifications,  that  they  believed  them  to  coincide  with  their  own 
proposals."  But,  as  the  Emperor  of  Russia  is  of a contrary opinion,  and as 
The  Times thinks  it  most  undoubtedly true,  that the  Czar's  "proceedings  in 
this  dispute  deserve  no  consideration  whatever,"  The  Times comes  to  the 
conclusion  that,  as  Russia  will  not  yield  to  the  reasonable  conditions  of 

40 

335 

Karl  Marx 

Turkey, Turkey must yield to the unreasonable conditions of Russia, and that 
"a  state  which is  yet  so  impotent as to require  European protection at every 
menace of aggression from without or insurrection from within, must at least 
so far pay the penalty of its weakness as to receive aid indispensable to its 
existence  on  the  terms least onerous to its supporters." The four Powers,  5 
of  course,  must join Russia against Turkey,  because Turkey is  supposed to 
want  their  aid  in  order  to  resist  Russia.—Turkey  must  "pay  the  penalty for 
its weakness," in having had recourse to the four great Powers  she is obliged 
by  treaties  to  appeal  to. 

"There  is no alternative.  Either the laws of England have to  be exercised  10 

in their  penal rigor upon the persons of four traitors,  (Aberdeen,  Clarendon, 
Palmerston,  and Russell), or the  Czar of Russia commands the world." Such 
declamation  as  this uttered in  The  Morning Advertiser, by  D. Urquhart,  is 
good for  nothing.  Who  is  to  judge  the four traitors?  Parliament.  Who forms 
that Parliament? The representatives of the Stockjobbers, the Millocrats, and 15 
the Aristocrats. And what foreign policy do  these representatives represent? 
That of the paix partout et toujours.  And who execute their ideas of foreign 
policy?  The  identical  four  men  to  be  condemned  by  them  as  traitors,  ac 
cording to the simple-minded Morning Advertiser. One thing must be evident 
at  least,  that  it  is  the  Stockjobbers,  and  the  Peacemongering  Bourgeoisie,  20 
represented  in  the  Government by  the  Oligarchy,  who  surrender  Europe to 
Russia,  and  that in order to  resist the  encroachments  of  the  Czar, we  must, 
above  all,  overthrow  the  inglorious  Empire  of  those  mean,  cringing  and 
infamous  adorers  of  the  veau d'or. 

Immediately  after  the  arrival  of  the  Vienna  note  at  Constantinople,  the  25 

Ottoman  Porte  called  80,000  men  of  the  Redif  s  under  arms.  According  to  a 
telegraphic dispatch dated Constantinople, Sept. 5, the Turkish Ministry had 
resolved, after a conference held at the house of the Grand Vizier, to maintain 
their  last  note  at  the  hazard  of  war.  The  enthusiasm  of  the  Mussulman 
population  has  reached  its  highest  pitch.  The  Sultan,  having  reviewed  the  30 
Egyptian troops,  and being received with deafening acclamations, was,  after 
the  review,  lifted  from  his  horse  by  the  multitude  and  carried  in  triumph 
through  the  streets  of  Stambul.  He  has  reiterated  to  the  Hospodars  of 
Moldavia and Wallachia his  order to  quiet the  principalities.  As the Russian 
subjects resident at Constantinople have been convicted of intriguing against  35 
the  Turkish Government,  Reschid Pacha has given a warning to the Russian 
Consul  on  their  behalf.  A  Constantinople  journal  states  that  the  Israelite 
community  at  Constantinople  has  offered to  the  Sultan  a million of piasters 
in order to contribute to the expenses occasioned by the military preparations 
of  the  Empire.  The  Smyrna  Israelites  are  said  to  have  come  to  a  similar  40 
resolution.  A letter in the  Vienna Press informs us that several Boyards have 

336 

The  Western  Powers  and  Turkey—Imminent  Economic  Crisis—Railway Construction  in  India 

been  arrested  at  Galatz  because  they  had  entered  into  a  secret  cor 
respondence with Omar Pacha informing him of all details with regard to the 
state  of  the  Russian  army  in  the  Principalities.  A  letter  of  Omar  Pacha 
has  been found  inviting  these  Boyards  to  enlist  as many foreigners  as pos-
sible.

Prince  Menchikoff had arrived at Vienna on the  13th instant, accompanied 
by  a  Secretary,  and  as  the bearer of a new manifesto of the  Emperor Nicho 
las,  addressed  to  the  European  Powers,  and  explaining  his  reasons  for  re 
jecting the  Turkish modifications.  The Emperor himself will arrive at Olmütz 
10  on  the  21st  instant,  accompanied  by  Count  Nessehode  and  by  Baron  de 
Meyendorff.  The  King  of  Prussia whom  he  had summoned by the Prince  de 
Lieven  to  the  Olmütz  Conference,  has  refused  to  make  his  appearance  on 
the  ground  that,  under  existing circumstances,  such a step on his part would 
have too  much éclat.  A Russian corps  d'armée 30,000 strong is stationed now 
at  Krajowo  on  the  frontiers  of Bulgaria.  Until now there  have  existed only 
eight  army  commissariats  in  the  Russian  Empire.  A  regular  ninth  com 
missariat  has  just  been  established  at  Bucharest—a  sure  indication  that  the 
Russians  do  not  think  of  evacuating  the  Principalities.

On  the  15th  of  Sept.  the  Bank  of  England  raised  its  rates  of  interest  to 
20  4V2 per  cent. The Money article in to-day's  Times tells us that "The measure 
is  regarded  with general  satisfaction."  In the  same article, however, we find 
it  stated  that,  "At  about  2  p.m.  business  at the  Stock Exchange  was  in fact 
almost  wholly  suspended,  and  when  the  announcement  was  made,  shortly 
afterward,  of  the  advance  to  4'/2  per  cent.,  prices  declined to  95 for money 
and  957s  to  ^4  for  the  13th of  Oct.  A  general  opinion prevailed,  that if  the 
advance had been to 5 instead of 4 7Σ per cent., the effect on the market would 
possibly  have  been  less  unfavorable,  since  the  public  would  then  have 
considered  the  probability  of  any  further  action  to  have ceased  . ..  In the 
Railway market a severe relapse occurred, after the breaking up of the Bank 
30  Court, and prices of all kinds left off with a very unsettled appearance." The 
writer  in  The  Times congratulates the Bank Directors on their following up 
the policy of the Peel Act. " In proportion as the circulation diminished from 
the drain of gold, the Directors have asked a higher price for the use of what 
remained,  and have  thus  allowed the Bank Charter Act of Sir R. Peel that 
free  course, by which alone its  soundness  can be demonstrated, and which 
was prevented by the infatuated proceedings of the Directors in 1847." Now 
I have shown in a former letter that the infatuation of the Directors in 1847 
consisted precisely  in their close adherence to the Peel Act, the "free course" 
of which had to be interrupted by Government, in order to save the Banking 
40  Department  from  the  necessity  of  stopping  payment.  We  read  in  The 

35 

Globe: 

337 

Karl  Marx 

"It  is  highly  improbable  that the  causes  which have produced our present 
prosperity will continue to operate in the same proportion. Unhealthy results 
have  already  appeared  in Manchester,  where  some of the largest firms  have 
been  compelled  to  limit  their  amount  of  production  . ..  All  departments  of 
the  Stock Exchange continue in a very depressed state. The Railway market 
is  in  a  complete  state  of  panic  . ..  The  efflux  of  gold to  the  Continent con 
tinues,  and  nearly  half  a  million  of  money  goes  over  to  St.  Petersburg in a 
day  or  two  by  steamer  . ..  One  object  of  its  (the  Bank's)  husbanding  its 
resources  of  specie  is  probably  a  desire  to  assist  the  Chancellor  of  the 
Exchequer  with  the  seven or  eight millions  which he  will require to  pay  off  10 
the  South-Sea  stockholders  and  other  dissentients." 

5 

The Morning Post of  the  14th inst.  reports from  Manchester: 
"The  market  for  cloth  and  yarn  is  dull,  and  the prices  of  all  descriptions 
of  manufactures  are barely  supported.  The  absence  of demand from almost 
every  foreign  market  and  the  anticipated  money  pressure  at  home,  have  15 
mainly  contributed  to  a  state  of  things  which  is  most  anomalous,  when 
contrasted  with  the  accounts  of  prosperity  generally  current." 

The  same  journal,  of  the  15th  inst.,  winds  up  a  leading  article  on  the 

collecting  elements  of  the  approaching  crisis  in  the  following  terms: 

"We warn the  commercial world that we  are  at a phase in which care and  20 

steady  consideration  are  eminently  requisite  in the  conception  and  conduct 
of  enterprise.  Our  financial  position,  besides,  is  one  which,  in  our  view,  is 
full  of  dangers  even  more  serious  and  more  difficult  of  avoidance  than  our 
commercial." 

From the combined statements of The Globe and Morning Post, it follows 25 

that while  the  demand is declining on the one hand, the supply, on the other, 
has  been  overdone.  Manufacturers  will  attempt  to  cover  their  retreat  by 
falling  back  on  the  quarrel existing  with their  workmen.  The  trade reporter 
in  yesterday's  Morning Chronicle writes  from  Manchester: 

"Manufactures  are  becoming  greatly  indifferent  about  entering  into  en-  30 

gagements, from the persuasion that an extensive, if not universal stoppage 
of mills must  take  place  before  any  settlement  of  the  wages  question can be 
effected.  On  this  subject there  have  been conferences  among  employers  in 
various  parts  of  the  districts  within  the  last few  days;  and  it is  evident  that 
the  exorbitant  clamors  set up  by  the  operatives,  together  with the  wild  at-  35 
tempts  at  dictation,  are  forcing  the  millowners  into  a  general  combination 
for  self-defense." 

We  read  in  the  money  article  of  The  Times: 
"Masters  are  forming  Unions  for  self-defense,  in  all  the  districts.  At 
Ashton, Staleybridge, Hyde, and Glossop, nearly  100 firms have placed their  40 
names  to  a  deed  of  Union  within the last few  days.  At Preston the  masters 

338 

The  Western  Powers  and  Turkey—Imminent  Economic  Crisis—Railway  Construction  in  India 

have  entered  into  heavy  bonds  to  each  other  to  resist  the  operatives  by 
closing  their  mills  for  three  months."

A  telegraphic  dispatch  from  Marseilles  reports  that  wheat  has  again  ad 
vanced  by  2frs.  25cent.  per  hectolitre.  The  augmentation of the  interest  on 
treasury  bonds,  announced  in  The  Moniteur,  produced  a most unfavorable 
impression  at the  Bourse;  that  measure being generally considered as a sign 
that  the  Government  is  in  want of money.  A loan was  spoken of which the 
Government would be  obliged  to contract. The Minister of Finance has  sent 
a  circular  to  a  vast  number  of  landed  proprietors,  asking  them  to  pay  six 
10  months' taxes in advance, as a mark of gratitude for the great benefits which 
the  present Government had  conferred on them,  and for the  additional value 
which  it  had  imparted  to  property.  "This,"  remarks  The  Observer,  "is  the 
beginning  of  the  end." 

15 

Having  dwelt  in  a  former  letter  on  the  vital  importance  of  railways  for 
India,  I think fit to give  now the latest news which has  been published with 
regard to the progress and prospects of the intended network. The first Indian 
railway was the line  now in operation between Bombay and Tannah. Another 
line  is  now  to  be  carried  from  Calcutta  to  Russnehael  on  the  Ganges,  a 
distance  of  180  miles,  and  then to  proceed  along the right bank of the  river 
20 to Patna, Benares and Allahabad. From Allahabad it will be conducted across 
the  Doab  to  Agra  and  thence  to  Delhi,  traversing in this  manner  a  space  of 
1,100  miles.  It  is  contemplated  to  establish  steam  ferry-boats  across  the 
Soane  and Tunona, and that the  Calcutta line will finally proceed from Delhi 
to Lahore.  In Madras a railway is to be commenced forthwith, which, running 
25  70  miles  due  west,  will  branch  off  into  two  arms—one  pursuing the Ghauts 
and  terminating  at Calicut, the other being carried on by Bellary and Poonah 
to  Bombay.  This  skeleton of the  chain of railways  will be completed by the 
Bombay,  Baroda  and  Central  India  Railway,  the  preliminary  surveys  for 
which are now proceeding under the  sanction of the Court of Directors. This 
line will pass from  Bombay by Baroda to  Agra, where  it will meet the  great 
trunk railway  from  Calcutta to  Delhi,  and  by its  means  Bombay, the Capital 
of  Western  India,  and  the  best  port  of  communication  with  Europe  for  all 
Hindostán,  will be  put in communication with Calcutta on the one hand, and 
with the Punjaub and  the  north-western provinces  on the other.  Thepromot-
35  ers  of  this  scheme  intend  also  to  throw  out  branches  into  the  great  cotton 
district  of  the  interior.  In  the  meantime,  measures  are  in progress  for  ex 
tending  the  electric  telegraph  throughout  the  whole  of  the  peninsula  of 
India.

The  Globe, in its number of Sept.  20, denies the  authenticity of the statement 
of the Journal des Débats with regard  to the mission of Mr. Reeve, and  The 
Times  of  Wednesday  reprints  the  article  of  The  Globe  under  the  head  of 
gobemoucherie, accusing the French press of trading in canards. But did not 
the  leading  article  of  The  Times I  analyzed  in my last letter  wholly  confirm 
the  statement  of  the  Journal  des  Débais?Has there  appeared  any refutation 
in  the  Paris  Moniteur'}  Did  not,  on the  same  day that  The  Globe gave  the 
lie to the Débats, the Assemblée Nationale reiterate that "Lord Redclif f e was 10 
to  notify  to  the  Sultan  that,  if  he  refused to withdraw  his  modification,  the 
English  fleet  would  enter  the  Dardanelles,  and  the  French  fleet  would  not 
be  slow  to  follow?"  Did  not  The  Times,  on  the  same  day  on  which  it  re 
produced  the  denial  of  The  Globe,  explicitly  declare  that  "England  and 
France  had  no  business  to  interfere  between Russia and  Turkey,  except on  15 
the  terms  proposed  by  the  four  allied  Powers,  and  accepted  by  Russia, 
whether  these  terms were  agreeable to  the haughty spirit of Turkey or not?" 
Were we  not told by  The Morning Post, before the Journal des Débats had 
arrived  at  London,  that  "on  the  receipt of the  Emperor of Russia's  answer 
to  the  proposal for the  modifications  of the Vienna note, the conference  of  20 
the  representatives  of  the  great Powers  had  immediately  assembled, and on 
the  4th  inst.  dispatched  a  courier  to  Constantinople  with  certain  com 
munications  from  the  Conference  to  the  Divan,  which  it  was  hoped  would 
induce  the  Porte  to  accept the  Vienna note?"  Finally,  we  read in  a  morning 
paper  of  to-day  that  "Mr.  Reeve  is  going  to  Constantinople,  that  he  is  the  25 
bearer  of  dispatches  from  Lord  Clarendon  to  Lord  Stratford  de  Redcliffe, 
and  that a connection of the  most intimate  kind  exists  between him  and  the 
Foreign  Office,  he  having  been  the  channel  of  communication  between 
Downing-st.  and  Printing-house  Square." 

The truth is, that since the last revelations made by the  French Press, the  30 

Eastern question has again assumed quite a new aspect,  and the ignominious 

340 

.  The  Western  Powers  and  Turkey—Symptoms  of  Economic  Crisis 

resolutions  the English Ministry had decided upon are likely to be frustrated 
by  events  contrary  to  all  their  calculations  and  expectations. 

Austria  has  seceded  from  the  joint  action with  her  pretended  allies;  the 
Vienna  conference  has  been  broken  off,  at  least  for  a moment.  Russia has 
pulled off the mask she thùiks no longer of any avail, and the English ministry 
is  driven  out  of  its  last  entrenchments.

"Lord  Aberdeen,"  as  The  Liverpool  Courier  justly  remarks,  "recom 
mended  that  the  Sultan  should  have  recourse  to  a  transparent  and  con 
temptible  fraud;  that  the  parties  to  the  Vienna  conference  should  exercise 
a  mental reservation with  regard to the note,  and that the Sultan should read 
it  in  an  unnatural sense,  i.e.,  the  terms  of  the  note  being clear  and  precise, 
and the  Emperor  of Russia having refused  point blank to  adopt the  Sultan's 
modifications, the Powers  should hold themselves prepared, hereafter, to act 
as  if those  modifications had  been  received." 

20 

15  Mr. Drouin de l'Huys suggested to the Vienna conference an explanatory 
note  conceived  in  that  hypocritical  sense,  and  to  be  communicated  to  the 
Porte,  but  Count  Buoi  rejected  this  proposition,  declaring  that  it  "was  too 
friendly  to  the  Porte,  that  the  time  was  gone  by  for  collective  action,  and 
that each power was free to  act as it pleased." Thus the  English ministry has 
lost  the  resource  of  covering  itself  with  the  common  arbitration  of  the 
European  Areopagus,  that  joint  stock  company  disappearing  before  one 
word  of  the  Austrian  Minister,  as  it  had  been  conjured  up  by  him.  In  the 
beginning  Austria  wanted  no  conference  at  all  till  Russia  had  crossed  the 
Pruth.  Russia  having  advanced  to  the  Danube,  Austria  does  want  the  con-
ference  no  more,  at least no  more on its primitive  conditions.  On the other 
hand  Count  de  Nessehode  has  published  two  circulars,  which  do  not  any 
longer  allow  backing  the  original  Vienna  note  by  hidden  "good intentions" 
or  interpreting  it  in  any  other  sense  than  its  literal  one. 

25 

The modifications proposed by the Porte  have reduced the whole question 

30 

to  "a  mere  question  of  words,"  shouted  the  whole  ministerial  press. 

By no means, says Nessehode. The Czar puts the same interpretation upon 
the  original text  as  the  Sultan did.  The original note is nothing and has never 
been  intended  to  be  anything but a  second edition of Menchikoff's note, and 
we do abide by the text, the whole text, and nothing but the text. The ministe-
rial  Globe is  of  course  amazed  at  the  discovery  that both the  Czar and  the 
Sultan,  regard  the  original  note  "as  implying recognition of those  demands 
which Russia had  preferred,  which Turkey  had refused,  and  which  the four 
Powers  did  not  (?)  intend  to  indorse,"  and  that  "Russia  insists  upon  an 
absolute  recognition  of  the  claims  which  she  first  advanced."  And  why 
should she not? If she was bold enough to advance those claims four months 
ago,  why  should  she  desist  now  after  having won  the  first  campaign?

The same G/obewhich pretended some days ago the Turkish modifications 
to be  scholastic  quibbles,  superfluous subtilities, is now obliged to own that 
"the  Russian  interpretation  shows  that  they  were  necessary." 

The  ftst dispatch of  Nesselrode  is  not yet made  public, but  The Morning 

Post assures  us that it  declares  "the Vienna note to be neither more nor less 
than  the  equivalent  of  Prince  Menchikoff's  note,"  and  The Evening Globe 
adds,  that  according  to  it, 

5 

"The  Emperor  regarded  the  Vienna  note as  securing for him  that recogni 
tion  on  Turkey,  and  that hold upon her Government,  which the  Porte,  with 
the  support of  the  four Powers,  had refused,  and which it was  the  object of 
the  mediation  to  prevent.  That  the  Emperor  never  ceased  to  reserve  to 
himself  the  right  of  dealing  directly  with  Turkey  alone,  setting  aside  the 
mediators  whom  he  affected  to  acknowledge." 

10 

At  no  time  did he  affect to acknowledge them as mediators. He permitted 
three  of them to march in the rear of Austria, while he allowed Austria herself 
to  come  an  humble  supplicant  to  him.

As  to  the  second  dispatch,  dated  St.  Petersburg,  7th,  published  by  the 
Berlin Zeit, on the  18th inst., and addressed to Baron Meyendorf at Vienna, 
Nesselrode  is  perfectly  right  in  stating  that the  original  note  was  described 
to  him  as  an  "ultimatum"  by  the  Austrian  Envoy,  which  Russia  obliged 
herself to  give her consent to upon the express condition of its being accepted 
by the  Porte  without any alteration  whatever.  "Will any one refuse to hear 
this  testimony  to  the  loyauté  of  the  Emperor?"  It  is  true  that  he  has  com 
mitted  a little  act of "piracy"  on the Principalities; that he has overrun them, 
seized  them,  taxed  them,  governed  them,  plundered  them,  appropriated  25 
them, eaten them up, notwithstanding the proclamations of Gortchakof f ; but 
never  mind.  Did  he  not,  on  the  other  hand,  "on  the  receipt  of  a  first  draft 
of  a note,  notify his accession to it by telegraph,  without waiting to learn if 
it had been  approved in London  or in  Paris?"  Could  he  be  expected  to  do 
more  than to  notify by telegraph, that a note, dictated by a Russian Minister  30 
at  Vienna,  would  not be  rejected  by  a Russian  Minister  at  St.  Petersburgh? 
Could  he  do  more  for  Paris  and  London  than  not  even  to  wait  for  their 
approval?  But he  did  more,  indeed.  The  draft, whose  acceptance  he  conde 
scended  to  notify by telegraph,  was  "altered" at Paris  and  London,  and  "did 
he  retract  his  consent,  or  raise  the  smallest  difficulty?"  It  is  true,  that  ac-  35 
cording  to  his  own  statement,  the  note  in  its  "final  form"  is  "neither  more 
nor  less  than  an  equivalent of  Prince  Menchikoff's  note;"  but an equivalent 
note  remains,  at  all  instances,  "different"from  the  original  one;  and had he 
"not  stipulated  the  acceptance  of  the  Menchikoff  note  without  any altera 
tion?"  Might  he  not,  "on  this  ground  alone,  have  refused  to  take  it  into  40 
consideration?"  He  did  not  do  so.  "Could  a  more  conciliatory  spirit  be 

342 

The  Western  Powers and Turkey—Symptoms of  Economic Crisis 

shown?"  The  ultimatum  of  the  Vienna  Conference  is  no  business  of his;  it 
is  their  own  property.  "It  is  their affair to  consider  the  delays which will 
result"  from  the  Sultan  not  yielding.  He,  for  his  part,  does  not  care  about 
staying some months longer in the Principalities, where his troops are clothed 
and  fed  for  nothing.

Odessa  does  not  suffer from  the mouth of the  Danube being blocked,  and, 
if  the  occupation  of the  Principalities  contributes  to raise the price of wheat 
at  Mark-lane,  the  profane  Imperials  will  find  the  quicker their way back to 
the  Holy  Russia.  It  is,  therefore,  for Austria and the  Powers to  "declare to 
the  Porte,  frankly  and  firmly,  that  they,  after  having  in  vain  opened  up  to 
it  the  only  road  that  could  lead  to  an  immediate  restoration  of its  relations 
with us  henceforth leave  the  task for itself alone."  They  did  enough for  the 
Sultan by  having  opened  the  road  to  the  Danube  to  the  Czar  and  closed  the 
road  to  the  Black  Sea to the Allied  Squadron.  Nesselrode's  "august master" 
15 denounces then, "the wari/Ae inspiration which seems at present to influence 
the  Sultan and the majority of his Ministers. " He, on his part, would certainly 
prefer  the  Sultan  taking  it  coolly,  opposing  peace  tracts  to  gun-boats,  and 
compliments  to  Cossacks.  "He  has  exhausted  the  measure  of  concessions, 
without  the  Porte  having  yet  made  a  single  one.  His  Majesty  can  go  no 
further."  Certainly  not,  he  can go no further, without crossing the  Danube. 
Nessehode  compresses  his  whole  argument into  a  masterly  dilemma not  to 
be escaped from.  Either the  alterations proposed by the Porte mean nothing, 
or  they  mean  something.  If  they  mean  nothing,  why  should the  Porte insist 
upon  them?  If  they  mean  something,  "it  is  very  simple  that  we  refuse  to 

20 

25  accede to them." 

"The evacuation of the Principalities,"  said Lord Clarendon, "is a sine qua 
non, preliminaryto  any  settlement."  Quite the contrary,  answers  Nesselrode. 
"The  settlement,  i.e.  the  arrival  of  the  Turkish  Embassador  bearing  the 
Austrian note without  alterations is a sine qua non preliminary to the evacu-

30  ation of  the  Principalities." 

In  one  word,  the  magnanimous  Czar  is  ready  to  part  with  the  Vienna 
Conference  humbug,  as  it  is  no  longer  wanted  for terminating his  first cam 
paign;  but  he  will  hold  the  closer  the  Principalities,  as  they  are  the  indis 
pensable  condition  for  commencing  the  second  one. 

35 

If  it be  true,  as  we  are  informed  to-day  by  telegraphic  dispatch, that the 
Conference  has  resumed  business,  the  Powers  will  repeat  to  Nicholas  the 
song  Alexander  was  received  with  by  the  Paris  mob:

Vive  Alexandre, 
Vive  le  roi  des  rois, 
Sans  ríen  prétendre 
Il nous  donne  des lois.

Karl  Marx/Friedrich  Engels 

The  Czar  himself,  however,  holds  no  longer  his  former  control  over  the 
Eastern  complication.  The  Sultan  has  been  forced  to  conjure  up  the  old 
fanatic  spirit,  to  cause  a new  invasion of Europe  by the  rude warlike  tribes 
of Asia, not to be  soothed down with diplomatic notes  and conventional lies, 
and  there  seems  transpiring,  even  through  the  insolent  note  of  the  Muscovite,  5 
something  like  an  apprehension  at  the  "warlike  spirit"  domineering  over 
Stambul.  The  manifesto,  addressed  by  the  Sultan  to  the  Mussulmans,  de 
clines any other concession to Russia,  and a deputation of the  Ulemas is said 
have  called  upon  the  Sultan  to  abdicate  or  to  declare  war  without  further 
delay.  The  division  in  the  Divan  is  extreme,  and  the  pacific  influence  of  10 
Reschid  Pacha  and  Mustapha  Pacha  is  giving way  to  that  of Mehemet Ali, 
the  Seraskier. 

The  infatuation  of  the  so-called  radical London  press  is  quite  incredible. 
After  having  told  us  some  days  ago,  that  "the  laws  of  England  have  to  be 
exercised in their penal rigor upon the persons of four traitors" (Aberdeen, 15 
Clarendon, Palmerston and Russell,) The Morning Advertiser, of yesterday, 
concludes  one  of  its  leaders  as  follows:  "Lord  Aberdeen  must,  therefore, 
make  way  for  a  successor.  Need we  say who that successor must be? There 
is but one man to whom  the  country points  at this  important junction,  as fit 
to be entrusted with the helm of affairs. That man is Lord Palmerston." The 20 
Morning  Advertiser  being  unable  to  read  events  and  facts,  should  at  least 
be  able  to  read  the  articles  of  Mr.  Urquhart,  published  day  after  day  in its 
own  columns. 

On Tuesday evening  a  meeting of  the  inhabitants  of  Sheffield was called, 

25 

by requisition to the Mayor, "to take into consideration the present unsettled 
and unsatisfactory  state of the Eastern question and the propriety of memori 
alizing government on the  subject."  A similar meeting is to be held at Stafford 
and  many  other  attempts  are  afloat  at  getting  up  public  demonstrations 
against  Russia  and  the  ministry  of  "all  the  talents."  But,  generally,  public 
attention is  absorbed  by  the  rate  of discount, corn prices,  strikes  and com-  30 
mereiai  apprehensions,  and more yet by the  cholera ravaging Newcastle and 
being met with explanatory  notes  by the London Board of Health.  An order 
in  council  has  been  issued,  putting  in  force  the  provisions  of  the  Epidemic 
Disease  Act  for  the  next  six  months  throughout  the  Islands;  and  hasty 
preparations for the  due reception of the scourge are making in London and  35 
other  great  towns.  If  I  shared  the  opinions  of  Mr.  Urquhart,  I  should  say, 
that the  Czar had dispatched the  Cholera morbus to England with the  "secret 
mission"to  break  down  the  last  remnant  of  what  is  called  the  Anglo-Saxon 
spirit. 

A wonderful  change  has come over the manufacturing districts during the  40 

last  four  weeks.  In  July  and  the  beginning  of  August  there  was  nothing  to 

344 

The  Western  Powers  and  Turkey—Symptoms  of  Economic  Crisis 

10 

be seen but bright prosperity, only slightly overshadowed by the distant cloud 
of the  "Eastern Question," and more  so, perhaps, by the fear that a shortness 
of  hands  would  prevent  our  cotton-lords  to  explore  to  the  dregs,  that  im 
mense mine of profitable business which they  saw before them.  The Eastern 
5  dispute  seemed  settled,  the  crop  might  certainly  turn out  a little  short,  but 
there  was  free  trade  to  keep  prices  down with the  never-failing  supplies  of 
America,  of  the  Black  Sea  and  the  Baltic.  Day  after  day  the  demand  for 
manufactured  goods  went  on  increasing.  California  and  Australia  poured 
forth  their  golden  treasures  into  the  lap  of  British  industry.  The  Times, 
forgetting  Malthus  and all its  own former rhapsodies  about overpopulation, 
seriously  discussed  the  question  whether  the  shortness  of  the  supply  of 
working-hands,  and consequent rise of wages, would not, by raising the cost 
of  production  of  British  manufactures  in a proportionate manner, put a stop 
to this flourishing trade, unless the Continent  sent a colony of workmen. The 
15  working  classes  were,  as  their  employers  said,  only  too  well off,  so  much 
so,  that  their  demands  knew  no  bounds,  and  their  "impudence"  was  daily 
becoming  more  intolerable.  But  that  was  in  itself  a  proof  of  the  immense, 
unheard-of  prosperity  which  the  country  was  enjoying;  and  what could  be 
the  cause  of  this  prosperity but Free Trade? And what was worth more than 
20 all this, was the certitude that the enormous trade done was sound, that there 
were  no  stocks,  no  wild  speculation.  Thus  the  manufacturers,  one  and  all, 
were  wont to express themselves, and they acted upon these views ; they built 
factories by the hundred, they ordered  steam engines of thousands of horse 
power, thousands  of power-looms, hundreds of thousands of spindles. Never 
25  was  engineering  and  machine-making  a  more  profitable  trade than in  1853. 
Establishments  broken  down  in  the  whole  of  their internal  organization by 
the  great  strike  of  1851,  now  regained their  position,  and even improved it; 
and  I  could  name  more  than  one  first-rate  and  celebrated  machine-making 
firm  who, but for this unprecedented business, would have  succumbed under 
the  consequence  of  the  blow  inflicted  by  the  mechanics  during  the  great 
turn-out. 

30 

35 

The  fact  is  that the bright sunshine of prosperity is for the moment hidden 
by  gloomy  clouds.  No  doubt,  the  altered  aspect  of the  Eastern dispute  has 
contributed  a  good  deal;  but  that  affects  the  home,  American  and  Colonial 
trade  very  little.  The  raising  of  the  rate  of  discount is  less  a cause  than  a 
symptom of  something being rotten in the  state  of  Denmark.  The  shortness 
of the crop and increase in the price of provisions  are no doubt causes which 
have  counteracted  and  will  counteract  still  more  the  demand  for  manufac 
tured  goods  from those  markets which are exposed to the operation of these 
40  causes, and  among these  the  home market, the mainstay of British industry, 
stands  in  the  first  rank.  But  the  rise  in  the  price  of  provisions  is  at  this 

345 

Karl  Marx/Friedrich  Engels 

moment, in most districts  of England and  Scotland, very nearly or altogether 
compensated  by  the  rise  of  wages,  so  that  the  purchasing  power  of  the 
consumer  can hardly  be  said  to  have  been  already lessened  much.  Then the 
rise  in  wages  has  raised  the cost of production in those branches  of industry 
in  which  manual  labor  prevails;  but  the  price  of  nearly  all  manufactured 
goods  was, up to August, pushed a good deal ahead of the cost of production 
by  the large  demand.  All  these  causes  have  cooperated  to  deaden business; 
but,  after  all,  they  are  not  sufficient to  account for the general  anxiety  that 
pervades  the  commercial  classes  of  the  manufacturing  districts. 

5 

The  fact  is,  that  the  spell  of  the  Free Trade delusions  is  vanishing away,  10 

and the bold industrial adventurers begin to have  aghmmeringthat economi 
cal revulsions,  commercial  crises  and recurrence of over-production are yet 
not  quite  so  impossible  in  a  Free  Trade  country  as they  dreamt.  And over 
production  there  has  been,  there  is,  there  must be,  for  even those  bugbears 
of  the  Manchester  Guardian,  the  "Stocks," are there;  aye,  and increasing  15 
too.  The demand for goods is decidedly falling off, while the supply increases 
every  day.  The  largest  and  most  numerous  of  the  new  industrial  con 
structions  are only now gradually coming into operation. The shortness of 
hands,  the  strikes  of  the  building  trades,  the  impossibility  of  supplying  the 
enormous  quantities  of  machinery  on  order,  have  caused  many  an untore-  20 
seen  delay  and  postponed,  for  a  time,  the  eruption  of  those  symptoms  of 
industrial  plethora  which  otherwise  would  have  shown themselves  sooner. 
Thus  the  largest  mill in the  world,  Mr.  T. Salt's,  near Bradford,  was  only to 
be  opened  this  week,  and  it  will  take  some  time  yet,  ere  the  whole  of  the 
productive power employed there can be brought fully to bear on the market. 
Thus plenty of the larger new concerns  in Lancashire will not be fit for work 
before winter,  while it will be spring, and perhaps later, before the market 
will feel the full effect of this new and stupendous accession of productive 
power.  According  to  the  last  news  from  Melbourne  and  Sidney,  import 
markets  were  becoming much duller,  and  many  shipments  will  now  be  in-  30 
definitely  postponed.  As  to  over-speculation,  we  shall  hear  of  that  by  and 
by,  when  accounts  come to be  closed.  Speculation has been distributed over 
such  a  variety  of  articles  that  it  shows  less  this  time  than before,  although 
there  is  plenty  of  it.

New-York  Daily  Tribune. 
Nr. 3900,  17. Oktober 1853 

London, Thursday,  Sept.  29,  1853. 

Correspondence  of  The  N.Y.Tribune. 

The  intelligence  that  the  combined  fleets  had  passed  up  the  Dardanelles, 
concurrent  with  rumors  of  a  change  in  the  Ministry  and  of  commercial 
difficulties,  produced  a  real  panic  at  the  Stock  Exchange  on  Saturday: 

5 

"To describe the  state of the  English funds, or the  scene that has prevailed 
in the  Stock  Exchange,  would be  a task of no  small difficulty.  It is rare that 
such  excitement  is  witnessed,  and  it  is  well  that  it  is  infrequent  . ..  It  is 
perhaps  no  inflation  to  assert  that  the  Bearing  at  the  present  time  equals 
almost  what  took  place  during  the  French Revolution  . ..  Funds  have  this 
week been done at 9 11^ and have not been so low since  1849... In the railway 
market  there  has  been  an  incessant  fall." 

10 

Thus  says  The Ministerial  Observer.  All  the leading railway  shares were 
about 68s. to 80s.  cp under the prices of the previous week.  As to the  sudden 
15  pressure  of  stock upon  the  market,  it would  not  signify  much, as the mere 
time-dealers  are  able,  at a given  moment,  to turn the  market  and intimidate 
the  bona  fide  stockholders.  But,  coinciding,  as  it  does,  with  general 
symptoms  of  a commercial  crisis,  the  great  fluctuation  of  funds,  even  if  it 
be  of  a  more  speculative  character, will prove  fatal in its  consequences.  At 
20  all  events,  this  consternation in the  money  market is condemnatory  of  any 
State  loans  looming  in  the  future,  and  particularly  so  of the  Austrian ones. 
Moreover,  capitalists  are  reminded that Austria did pay,  in  1811,  a dividend 
Is. 7d. farthing in the pound on their promissory notes; that, notwithstanding 
her  revenue  having  been  screwed  up  from  £12,000,000 to  £18,000,000  Ster-
ling, by means of a greatly increased pressure of taxation exerted on Hungary 
and Lombardy  since  1849; her annual deficit amounts, on an average, to more 
than  one-quarter  of  her  whole  revenue;  that  about  £50,000,000  have  been 
added to  her national  debt  since  1846;  and that  she only has been prevented 
from  a  new  bankruptcy  by  the  interested  forbearance  of  the  children  of 
Israel, who still hope to rid their tills of heaps of Austrian paper accumulated 
in  them.

"Trade  has  been  pushed  on  somewhat  beyond  its  proper  limits,  and  our 
commercial  habilities  have  partially  outstripped  our  means,"  says  The 
Observer. "It is useless," exclaims The Morning Post, "to evade the question, 
for  although  there  are  some  favorable  features  in  the  pending  crisis  which 
did  not  exist  in  1847,  it must be perceptible to  every intelligent observer of 
passing  events  that,  to  say  the  least  of  it,  a very  trying condition of  affairs 
has arrived." The bullion reserve in the Bank of England has again decreased 
by  £338,954,  and  its  reserve  of  notes—i.e.,  the  fund  available  for  dis 
counts—amounts but to  seven millions, a sum fully required by the Chancel 
lor  of  the  Exchequer  for  paying  off  the  dissentient  holders  of  South  Sea  10 
stock.  As  to  the  state  of  the  Corn  Market,  we  learn  the  following  from 
yesterday's  Mark-lane Express: 

5 

"With  average  crops  we  have  for  years  consumed  some  millions  of 
quarters  of foreign Wheat per annum. What, then, are our requirements likely 
to  be  under  existing  circumstances?  The  produce  of  Wheat  at  the  utmost  15 
cannot be  estimated at  more  than three-quarters  of  an  average,  and there is 
no  excess  in the  yield  of  any other  crop.  Potatoes  are  seriously  affected by 
disease,  and  have  been  forced  into  consumption  so  rapidly,  owing  to  their 
unfitness  for  storing,  that  this  article  of  food  must  very  shortly  become 
scarce.  So enormous has been our consumption that with an importation of  20 
3,304,025 qrs.  of Wheat and 3,337,206 cwts.  of Flour during the eight months 
ending the 5th inst, the stocks in granary are by no means excessive 
We 
are  anxious  not to  exaggerate  the  difficulties  the  country  may be  placed  in, 
but  that diïficulties exist it  would be folly to deny... The reports as to the 
yield  of  Wheat  are  very  unsatisfactory;  in  many  cases  where  the  produce 
has  been  tested  by  thrashing,  the  quantity  turned  out  little  more  than  half 
of  what  had  been  calculated  upon." 

25 

While  thus the  bright  sunshine  of commercial  and  industrial prosperity  is 
hidden by  gloomy  prospects,  strikes are  still forming,  and will for  some time 
yet  form,  an  important  feature  of  our  industrial  condition;  only  they  are  30 
beginning to change their character contemporary with the change that is now 
going  on  in  the  general  condition  of  the  country. 

At Bury  a  new  advance  of 2d.  per  1,000  hanks  has  been asked on the part 
of  the  spinners.  Masters  refusing,  they  left  work,  and  the  weavers  will  do 
so  as  soon  as they have worked up  the yarn on hand.  At Preston, while the  35 
weavers  still  demand  an  advance  of  10  per  c e n t,  being  supported  by  the 
operatives  of  the  surrounding  districts,  six masters  have  already locked  up 
their mills and the others  are likely to follow them.  Two thousand operatives 
have  thus  been  thrown  out  of  work.  At  Blackburn  the  mechanics  of  Mr. 
Dickinson, iron-founder, still remain out. At Wigan the capreelers of one mill  40 
have  struck  for  an  advance  of  Id.  per  score,  and  the  throstle-spinners  of 

348 

Panic  on  the  London  Stock  Exchange—Strikes

another  mill  refused  to  commence  work until  their  wages  were  advanced. 
The mills  were  closed.  At the  same  place  the coal-miners'  strike, embracing 
about  5,000  hands,  is  going  on.  The  Earl  of  Crawford,  and  other extensive 
coal-miners  in  the  neighborhood,  dismissed  their  hands  on  Wednesday 
evening.  A  numerous  meeting  of  the  colliers  was  then  held  in  Scales'  Or 
chard. At Manchester, 5,000 looms  stand still, besides the minor strikes going 
forward,  such  as  that  of the  fustian-dyers,  the  skein-dyers,  felt-hat  makers, 
etc.  At Bolton,  meetings  of the  operative  cotton-spinners  are  being held for 
an advance of wages. There are shoemakers'  strikes at Trenton, Bridgewater, 
10 etc. ; cab-drivers' strikes at Glasgow ; masons' strikes at Kilmarnock; threat 
ened turn-outs  of the  police at Oldham, etc.  At Birmingham, nailers demand 
an advance  of  10 per cent. ; at Wolverhampton, the carpenters one of 6d. per 
day;  the  London  carpenters  ditto,  and  so  on.  While  through the  principal 
manufacturing  towns  of  Lancashire,  Cheshire,  Derbyshire,  etc.,  the  opéra 
tives  are  holding  public  meetings,  to  decide upon  measures  for the  support 
of  their  suffering  brethren,  the  masters  on  the  other  hand  are  resolved  to 
close their establishments  for  an indefinite period, with the design of starving 
their  hands  into  subjection. 

is 

20 

"We  find,"  says  The  Sunday  Times,  "that generally  speaking,  the  demand 
for  an  advance  of  wages  has  not  exceeded  6d.  a  day;  and,  looking  at  the 
present  price  of  provisions,  it  can  hardly  be  said  that  the  demand  is  an 
unreasonable  one.  We  know  it  has  been  said  that  one  aim  of  the  present 
strikers is to obtain a sort of communistic share of the real or supposed profits 
of  the  manufacturer;  but  the  comparison  between  the  increased demand 
25 for wages and the enhanced value of the prime necessaries of life, furnishes 

an  ample  refutation  of  the  charge." 

When  the  working  people  ask  for  more  than  "the  prime  necessaries  of 
life,"  when  they  pretend  "to  share"  in  the  profits  resulting from their own 
industry,  then  they  are  accused  of  communistic tendencies.  What  has  the 
30  price  of  provisions  to  do  with the  "eternal  and  supreme  law of  supply  and 
demand?"  In  1839,  1840,  1841,  and  1842,  while  there  was  a continued  rise 
in the  price  of provisions,  wages  were  sinking until they reached the  starva 
tion point.  "Wages,"  said then the  same manufacturers,  "don't depend  upon 
the  price  of  provisions,  but  upon  the  eternal  law  of  supply  and  demand." 
35  "The  demands  of  the  working people,"  says  The  Sunday Times,  "may be 
submitted  to  when  'urged  in  a respectful manner'."  What has  respect to  do 
with  the  "eternal  law  of  supply  and  demand?"  Has  any  one  ever  heard  of 
the  price  of  coffee  rising  at  Mincing-lane  when  "urged  in  a  respectful 
manner?"  The  trade  in  human flesh  and  blood,  being carried  on in the  same 
40  manner  as  that  of  any  other  commodity,  give  it at least the chances  of any 

other.

The  wages-movement  has  been  going on  now  for  a period  of  six months. 

Let  us  judge  it  by  the  test  acknowledged  on  the  part  of  the  masters  them 
selves,  by  the  "eternal  laws  of  supply  and  demand,"  or  are we, perhaps,  to 
understand,  that  the  eternal  laws  of  political  economy  must  be interpreted 
in the  same manner as the eternal  peace-treaties Russia has  concluded with 
Turkey?

Six  months  ago  the  workpeople,  had  they  even  found  their  position  not 
strengthened  by  the great demand for their labor, by constant and enormous 
emigration  to  the  gold  fields  and  to  America,  must  have  inferred  the  en 
hancement  of  industrial  profits  from  the  general  prosperity-cry  uttered  by 
the middle-class press exulting at the blessings of Free Trade. The workmen, 
of  course,  demanded their  share  of that so loudly proclaimed prosperity, but 
the masters fought hard against them.  Then, the workmen combine, threaten 
to  strike,  enforce their demands in a more or less amicable manner. Wherever 
a strike occurs, the whole  of the masters and their organs in pulpit, platform  15 
and  press,  break  out  into  immoderate  vituperation  of  the  "impudence  and 
stupidity"  "of  such  attempts at dictation." Now, what did the strikes prove, 
if  not  that  the  workmen  preferred  applying  a  mode  of  their  own  of testing 
the  proportion of  the  supply  to  the  demand rather  than to  trust to  the  inter 
ested  assurances of their employers?  Under certain circumstances, there  is  20 
for  the  workman  no  other  means  of  ascertaining  whether  he  is  or  not paid 
to  the  actual  market value  of  his  labor,  but to  strike  or to threaten to  do  so. 
In  1852,  on  an  average,  the  margin between  the  cost of the raw material and 
the  price  of  the  finished  goods—for  instance,  the  margin  between the  cost 
of raw  cotton  and  that of  yarn,  between the  price  of  yarn and that of cotton  25 
goods,  was  greater,  consequently  the  profit  of the  spinner and the  manufac 
turer was undoubtedly larger than it has been in 1853. Neither yarn nor goods 
have,  until  very  lately,  risen  in the  same  proportion  as  cotton.  Why,  then, 
did  the  manufacturers  not  advance  wages  at  once  in  1852?  There  was  no 
cause,  say they, in the relative position of supply and demand justifying such  30 
a rise  of  wages  in  1852.  Indeed?  Hands  were  not  quite  as  short  a  year  ago 
as  they  are  now,  but  the  difference  is  out  of  proportion  to  the  sudden  and 
repeated  rise  of  wages  forced out of the manufacturers  since then, by virtue 
of  the  law  of  supply  and  demand,  as  expounded  by  turn-outs.  There  are, 
certainly,  more  factories  at  work  than  last  year,  and  more  able-bodied  35 
workmen  have  emigrated  since  then,  but  at  the  same  time  never  has  there 
been such  a supply of factory labor poured into our  "hives of industry" from 
agricultural  and  other  pursuits,  as  during  the  last  twelve  months. 

The  fact  is  that  the  "hands,"  as  usual,  perceived,  only  too  late,  that  the 
value  of  their  labor  had  risen  30  per  cent,  many  a  month  ago,  and  then,  in  40 
the  summer of this year—only then—they began to strike, first for 10 per cent., 

350 

Panic  on  the  London  Stock  Exchange—Strikes 

5 

then for another  10 per cent., and so on, for as much, of course, as they could 
get.  The  constant  success  of  these  strikes, while it generalized them  all over 
the country, was the best proof of their legitimacy and their rapid succession 
in  the  same  branch  of  trade, by  the  same  "hands"  claiming fresh  advances, 
fully  proved that according to  supply and demand the work-people had long 
been entitled to  a rise of wages, which was merely kept from them on account 
of  their  being  ignorant  of  the  state  of  the  labor  market.  When  they  at  last 
became  acquainted  with  it,  the  manufacturers,  who  had  all  the  while 
preached  "the  eternal  law  of  supply  and  demand,"  fell  back on the  doctrine 
10  of  "enlightened  despotism," claiming the  right to  do  as  they liked with then-
own,  and  propounding  as  their  angry  ultimatum that  the  work-people  don't 
know  what  is  good  for  them. 

15 

The  change  in the  general  commercial prospects  must change the relative 
position  of  the  work-people  and  their  employers.  Sudden  as  it  came  on,  it 
found many  strikes begun,  still more  in preparation.  No doubt, there will be 
more,  in  spite  of the  depression,  and,  also,  for  a rise  of  wages,  for  as to the 
argument  of  the  manufacturer,  that  he  cannot  afford  to  advance,  the  work 
men  will  reply,  that  provisions  are  dearer;  both  arguments  being  equally 
powerful.  However,  should,  as  I  suppose,  the  depression prove  lasting,  the 
20  work-people  will  soon  get  the  worst  of  it,  and  have  to  struggle—very  un 
successfully—against  reduction.  But  then  their  activity  will  soon  be  carried 
over to the political field, and the new organization of trades, gained in the 
strikes,  will  be  of immense  value  to  them.

The Russians in Turkey. 

The  certainty  of  war,  and  the  probability  that each steamer that now  arrives 
from  Europe  will report the  maneuvres  of  armies  and the  results  of battles, 
render  it  more  than  ever  necessary accurately  to  understand  the  respective 
positions  and  forces  of  the  combatants,  and  the  various  facts  which  will 
govern  the  movements  of  the  campaign.  This  necessity we propose  to meet 
by  a  succinct  analysis  of the  elements  of offense  and defense on both  sides, 
and  of  the  leading  strategic  considerations  which  are  likely  to  have  weight 
on  the  minds  of  the  opposing  commanders. 

5 

The  Russian  troops  occupying  the  Danubian  Principalities  consisted,  at  10 

the beginning,  of two infantry corps and the usual amount of reserve cavalry 
and  artillery.  An  infantry  corps  in  Russia,  counts  three  divisions,  or  six 
brigades  of  infantry,  several  regiments  of  light  cavalry,  and  a  brigade  of 
artillery,  which,  altogether,  should  amount to  about 55,000 men, with about 
a  hundred  guns.  To  every  two  infantry  corps  there  is  a  "reserve  cavalry  15 
corps"  and  some reserve  artillery,  including heavy  siege  artillery.  Thus, the 
original  army  of  occupation  amounts,  upon  paper,  to  something  like 
125,000  men.  A  third  infantry corps  has  since  begun  to  cross  the  Pruth,  and 
we  may,  therefore,  after  all  due  deductions,  consider  the  Russian  forces 
concentrated on the Danube, to number from  140,000 to  150,000 fighting men.  20 
How  many,  in  a  given  moment,  may  be  able  to  rally  around the  standards, 
depends  upon  the  sanitary  condition  of the  district,  the  greater or less  effi 
ciency  of  the  Russian  commissariat,  and  other  circumstances  of  a  similar 
nature  which  it  is  impossible  correctly  to  estimate  at  a  distance. 

From  all  the  information  at  our  command,  the  Turkish  army opposed to  25 

the Russians on the Danube,  may be estimated at the very outside, at 110,000 
to  120,000 men. Before the arrival of the Egyptian contingent, it was generally 
asserted  not to  surpass  90,000  men.  There  is,  then,  as  far  as  we can judge, 
an  evident  inferiority  of  numbers  on  the  part  of  the  Turks.  And  as  to  the 

352 

The  Russians  in  Turkey 

intrinsic  value  and  quality  of  either  army,  an  equal  superiority  on  the  part 
of the Russians must be  admitted.  It is  true that the Turkish artillery, formed 
by  excellent  French  and  Prussian  officers,  enjoys  a  high  reputation,  while 
the Russian gunners  are  notoriously poor marksmen; but in spite of all recent 
improvements,  the  Turkish  infantry  cannot be  compared to  Russian grena 
diers,  and Turkish horsemen still lack that discipline and steadiness  in battle 
which  will  allow  of  a  second  and  a  third  charge  after  the  first  has  been 
repulsed. 

5 

The  Generals,  on  both  sides,  are  comparatively  new  men.  The  military 
10  merits  of Prince  Gorchakoff, the Russian commander,  and the reasons why 
the  Emperor  appointed  him  to  that  post,  we  have  already  had  occasion  to 
state  to  our  readers.  An  honest  man,  and  a  zealous  partisan  of  Russia's 
"manifest  destiny,"  it  yet  remains  to  be  seen  whether  he  can  conduct  a 
campaign of  such  magnitude  as  that now opening.  Omer Pasha, the Turkish 
15  generalissimo, is better known, and what we know of him is generally favor 
able.  His  expeditions  against  Kurdistan  and  Montenegro  were,  the  first 
successful  under  difficult  circumstances;  the  second,  exceedingly  well 
planned,  and  certain  of  almost  bloodless  success,  but  for  the  interference 
of  diplomacy.  The  chief  superiority,  then,  which  can  be  found  on  the  side 
20  of  the  Turks  is,  perhaps,  that  of  generalship;  in  most  other  respects  the 

Russians  have  the  advantage. 

25 

Though the Turks  have  declared war,  and  are  perhaps, more vehement in 
their  disposition  to come to blows  than the  Russians;  it  seems  evident, that 
as  the  weaker  party,  they  will  find  the  greater  advantage in defensive,  and 
the Russians in offensive action. This of course excludes the chances which 
may  arise  from  glaring  mistakes  in  the  arrangements  of  either  General.  If 
the  Turks  were  strong enough for the offensive, their tactics would be plain. 
They  would  then  have  to  deceive  the  Russians  by  false  maneuvers  on  the 
upper  Danube,  concentrate  their  forces  rapidly  between  Silistria  and  Hir-
sova,  cross  the  lower  Danube,  fall  upon  the  enemy  where  his  position  is 
weakest,  namely,  at  the  narrow  strip  of  land  forming  the  frontier  between 
Wallachia,  and  Moldavia;  and  then  separating  the  Russian  troops  in  both 
PrincipaUties  from  each  other,  repel  with  concentrated  forces  the  corps  in 
Moldavia,  and  crush  that  which  would  find  itself  isolated  and  cut  off  in 
35  Wallachia.  But as  all the chances  of an offensive  movement are  against the 
Turks,  they  could  reasonably  undertake  a  similar  operation in  consequence 
only of  egregious  blunders  on  the  part  of  the  Russian  General. 

30 

If  the  Russians  seize  the  opportunity for  offensive  action,  they  have  two 
natural  obstacles  to  pass  before  they  penetrate  to  the  heart  of  the Turkish 
empire;  first  the  Danube  and then the Balkan. The passage of a large river, 
even  in  presence  of  a  hostile  army,  is  a  military  feat  so  often  performed 

40 

353 

Friedrich  Engels

during  the  revolutionary  and  Napoleonic  wars,  that  every  lieutenant 
now-a-days  can  tell  how  it  is  to be  done.  A few feigned  movements,  a well 
appointed pontoon train,  some batteries to  cover the bridges, good measures 
for  securing  the  retreat,  and  a  brave  vanguard,  are  about  all the conditions 
required.  But  the  crossing  of  a  great  mountain  range,  and  especially  one 
provided  with  so  few passes  and practicable  roads  as  the  Balkan,  is  a  more 
serious  operation.  And  when  this  mountain range  runs  parallel  to  the  river, 
at a distance  of  no  more than  forty  or  sixty  miles,  as  the  Balkan  does to the 
Danube,  the  matter  becomes  more  serious  still,  as  a  corps  defeated  on the 
hills  may,  by  active pursuit,  be cut off from its bridges  and thrown into the 
river before  succor can arrive ; an army, thus defeated in a great battle, would 
be  inevitably  lost.  It  is  this  proximity  and  parallel  direction  of  the  Danube 
and  the  Balkan  which  forms  the  natural  military  strength  of  Turkey.  The 
Balkan, from the Macedo-Servian frontier to the Black Sea, that is the Balkan 
proper,  "Veliki Balkan," has five passes, two  of which are high roads, such  15 
as  high  roads  are  in Turkey.  These  two  are  the  passes  of  Ichtiman,  on  the 
road  from  Belgrade,  through  Sofia,  Philippople  and  Adrianople  to  Con 
stantinople,  and  of Dobrol,  on the road from Silistria and Shumla. The other 
three,  of  which two  are between the  above  and  the  third  towards  the  Black 
Sea,  may  be  considered  as  impracticable  for  a  large  army,  with  the  im-  20 
pediments  of  war.  They  may  give  passage  to  smaller  corps,  perhaps  even 
to  light  field  artillery,  but  they  cannot  be  made  the  lines  of  operation  and 
of  communication  for  the  main  body  of  the  invaders. 

10 

In  1828  and  1829,  the  Russian forces  operated  upon the line from Silistria 
by Dobrol to Adrianople,  and indeed, this route being the shortest and most  25 
direct  from  the  Russian  frontier  to  the  Turkish  Capital,  offers  itself  as  the 
most  natural  to  any  Russian army which comes from the north, is  supported 
by  a  fleet  in  undisputed  possession  of  the  Black  Sea,  and  whose  object  is 
to  bring  matters  to  a  speedy  decision  by  a  victorious  march  upon  Con 
stantinople. In order to pass by this road, a Russian army, after having passed 30 
the  Danube,  has  to  force  a  strong position flanked by the  two fortresses  of 
Shumla  and Varna,  to  blockade  or  to  take both of these fortresses, and then 
to  pass  the  Balkan.  In  1828,  the  Turks  risked  their  main  strength  in  this 
position.  They  were  defeated  at  Kulevcha;  Varna  and  Shumla were  taken, 
the  defense  of  the  Balkan  was  but  feeble,  and  the  Russians  arrived  at  35 
Adrianople,  very  much  enfeebled,  it  is  true,  but  yet having encountered  no 
resistance,  as  the  Turkish  army was  completely  dissolved  and  not a brigade 
at  hand  for  the  defense  of  Constantinople.  The  Turks  committed,  on  that 
occasion,  a  great  mistake.  A  range  of  mountains,  as  every  officer  under 
stands,  must  not  be  defended  by  a  defensive  position  in  front  of  it,  nor  by  40 
dividing the  defending  armies  so  as  to block up  all the  passes; but by taking 

354 

The  Russians  in  Turkey 

up  a  central  position  behind  it,  by  observing  all  the  passes,  and  when  the 
enemy's intentions  are  clearly developed, by falling with concentrated forces 
upon  the  heads  of  his  columns  as  they  emerge  from  the  various  ravines  of 
the mountain range. The  strong position across the Russian line of operations 
5  between Varna and  Shumla led  the  Turks  to make that decisive  stand there, 
which,  with  more  concentrated  strength  and  against  an  enemy  necessarily 
weakened by  sickness  and detachments, they ought to have made in the plain 
of  Adrianople. 

10 

Thus  we  see  that  in  the  defense  of  the  line  from  Silistria  to  Adrianople 
the  passage  of the  Danube  ought  to  be  defended without risking a decisive 
action. The  second  stand  should be made  behind, not  between, Shumla and 
Varna,  and no  decisive  action  risked  unless  the  chances  of victory  are  very 
great.  Retreat  across the Balkan is the  next step leaving the passes  defended 
by  detachments,  capable  of  as  much  resistance  as  may  appear  advisable 
15  without bringing on  a  decisive  engagement.  In  the  mean  time the Russians 
will weaken themselves by blockading the fortresses, and, if they follow their 
anterior  practice,  they  will  again  take  these  fortresses by  storm,  and  lose  a 
great  many  men by  the  operation;  for  it is  a curious  fact,  and  characteristic 
of  the  Russian army,  that up  to  the  present time  it  has,  unaided,  never been 
20  able to lay a regular siege. The want of skillful engineers and artillerists, the 
impossibility  of  creating  in  a  barbarous  country  large  magazines  of  war, 
material  for  sieges,  or  even  to  carry  across  immense  tracts  of  country 
whatever material  may  exist,  have  always  driven the Russians to the neces 
sity  of  carrying  every  fortified  place  by  assault  after  a  short,  violent,  but 
25  seldom  very  effective  cannonade.  Thus  Suworow  took  Ismail  and  Ochakof  ; 
thus,  in  1828  and  1829,  the  Turkish  fortresses  in  Europe  and  Asia  were 
stormed;  and  thus  they  carried  Warsaw  in  1831.  In either case the Russian 
army  will  arrive  at the passes  of the  Balkan in a weakened condition,  while 
the  Turks  have  had  time  to  concentrate  their  detachments  from  all  sides.  If 
the invaders are not repelled while attempting to cross the Balkan, by a dash 
of the whole Turkish army, the decisive battle may be fought under the walls 
of  Adrianople,  and  then,  if  the  Turks  are  defeated,  they  will  at  least  have 
exhausted  all  the  chances  left  them. 

30 

But  a  Russian  victory  at  Adrianople  can,  under  present  circumstances, 
35  decide  very  little.  The  British  and  French fleets  are  at Constantinople,  and 
in their teeth no  Russian General can march upon that capital. The Russians, 
arrested  at  Adrianople,  unable  to  rely  on  the  support  of  their  fleet,  which 
itself  would  be  menaced,  would  soon  fall  victims  by  thousands  to  disease, 
and  have  to  retrace  their  steps  beyond  the  Balkan.  Thus,  even  in  victory, 
they  would  be  defeated  as  regards  their  great  object  in  the  war.  There  is, 
however, another Une of operations  which they may, perhaps, more advanta-

40 

355 

Friedrich  Engels 

geously  take.  It  is  indicated  by  the  route  which  leads  from  Widdin  and 
Nikopolis,  by  way  of  Sofia,  to  Adrianople.  Apart  from  political  con 
siderations,  it  would  never  enter  the  head  of  any  sensible  Russian General 
to  follow  this  route.  But  so  long  as  Russia  can  depend  on  Austria—so  long 
as  the  approach  of  a  Russian  army  to  the  Servian  frontier,  combined  with 
Russian  intrigues  in  Servia,  may  excite  insurrectionary  movements  in  that 
country,  in  Montenegro,  and  among the predominant Greco-Slavic popula 
t i on  of  Bosnia,  Macedonia,  and  Bulgaria—so  long  as the crowning operation 
of  a  strictly  military  campaign,  the  taking  of  Constantinople,  is  out  of  the 
question,  from  the  presence  of  a  European fleet—so long  this plan of cam-  10 
paign  will  be  the only  one  which the  Russians  can adopt with much chance 
of  success,  and  without  forcing  England  and  France  to  determined  hostile 
action  by  too  direct  a  march  upon  Constantinople. 

5 

20 

It  appears,  indeed,  from  the  present  position  of  the  Russian  army,  that 
something  of  this  sort  is  projected.  Its  right  wing  has  been  extended  to  15 
Krajowa,  near  the  western  frontier  of  Wallachia,  and  a  general  shifting  of 
its  array  toward  the  upper  Danube  has  taken  place.  As  this  maneuver  is 
entirely out of the line of operations by Silistria and  Shumla, it can only have 
for  its  object  to  put  the  Russians  in communication  with  Servia,  the  center 
of Sclavic nationality and Greek Catholicism in Turkey. A defensive position 
on  the  lower  Danube,  combined  with  an  advance  across  the  upper  Danube 
toward  Sofia,  would be perfectly safe if supported by Austria, combined with 
a  movement  of  the  Turkish  Slavonians  in  favor  of  national  independence; 
and  such  a movement  could  not be more forcibly provoked than by a march 
of  the  Russian  army  into  the  very  heart  of  the  Slavonian  population  of  25 
Turkey.  Thus,  the  Czar will obtain far more easily and in a far less offensive 
manner what he  has  claimed throughout the controversy. This is the organi 
zation of  all  the  Turkish Slavonians in distinct principalities, such as Molda 
via,  Wallachia  and  Servia  now  are.  With  Bulgaria,  Montenegro  and  Mace 
donia  under  the  nominal  sovereignty  of  the  Sultan  and  the  real protection  30 
of  the  Czar,  Turkey  in  Europe  would  be  confined  to  the  environs  of  Con 
stantinople  and  deprived  of  its  nursery  of  soldiers,  Albania.  This would be 
a far  better  result  for  Russia than a decisive victory at  Adrianople, followed 
by a dead  stand  of  her  armies.  It is  a result which appearances indicate that 
she is about to try for. Whether she is not mistaken in relying on the Slavoni-  35 
ans  of  Turkey  is  a doubtful question, though there will be no cause of aston 
ishment  should  they  all  declare  against  her.

The  Eastern  complications  have  worked  a  great  change  in  England,  if  not 
as  to  parties,  at  least  as  to the  men  at the  head  of  parties.  Lord Palmerston 
has  again  become  a popular favorite.  He  is  in everybody's  mouth,  he  is  the 
5  only  man to  save  England, he is confidently announced as the indispensable 
Premier  of  any  modified  Cabinet,  extolled  alike  by  the  Tories,  the  Whigs, 
the  self-styled  patriots,  the  press,  and  public  opinion  in  general. 

So  extraordinary a phenomenon is the Palmerston mania that one is tempt 
ed  to  suppose  it  to  be  of  a  merely  factitious  character,  got up  not  for  home 
10  consumption,  but  as  an  article  of  export,  destined  for  foreign  use.  This, 
however,  would be  a mistake.  Ruggiero  is  again  and  again fascinated by the 
false charms of Alcine, which, as he knows, disguise an old witch, "sans eyes, 
sans  teeth,  sans  taste,  sans  everything,"  and the knight-errant cannot with 
stand  falling  in love  with her  anew, whom  he  knows  to  have  transmuted  all 
15  her former adorers into asses and other beasts. The English public is another 
Ruggiero  and  Palmerston  another  Alcine.  Although  a  septuagenarian, who, 
since  1807,  has  occupied  the  public  stage  almost  without  interruption,  he 
continues  to  remain a novelty, and to evoke all the hopes that used to center 
upon untried and promising youth.  With one foot in the grave, he is supposed 
20  not  to  have  begun  his  true  career.  If  he  were  to  die  to-morrow  all  England 
would  be  surprised  to  learn  that  he  had  been  a  Secretary  of State,  for half 
a  century. 

If  not  a  good  statesman  of  all  work  he  is  a  good  actor  of  all  work.  He 
succeeds  in the  comic  as  in the  heroic, in pathos as in familiarity, in tragedy 
25  as  in farce,  although the latter may be more  congenial to  his feelings.  He is 
not a first-class orator, but an accomplished debater.  Possessed of a wonder 
ful  memory,  of  great  experience,  of  consummate  tact,  of  never-failing 
presence  of  mind,  of  gentleman-like  variety  of  talent,  of  the  most  minute 
knowledge  of  parliamentary  tricks,  intrigues,  parties  and  men,  he  handles 

357

difficult cases in  an admirable manner, and with a pleasant volatility, sticking 
to  the  prejudices  and the  susceptibilities  of his  audience,  secured from  any 
surprise  by  his  cynic  impudence,  from  any  self-confession  by  his  selfish 
dexterity,  and  from  running  into  a  passion  by  bis  profound  frivolity,  his 
perfect  indifference,  and  his  aristocratic  contempt.  Being  an  exceedingly 
happy joker, he ingratiates  himself with every body. Never losing his temper, 
he imposes on passionate antagonists. If unable to master a subject, he knows 
how  to  play with  it.  If  wanting general  views,  he  is  always ready to  weave 
a  web  of  elegant  generalities. 

5 

Endowed with a restless  and indefatigable  spirit, he abhors inactivity and  10 

pines  for  agitation,  if  not  for  action.  A country like  England allows him,  of 
course,  to  busy  himself  in  every  corner  of  the  earth.  If  he  can  do  nothing, 
he will devise anything. Where he dares not interfere, he intermeddles. When 
unable to vie with a strong enemy he extemporizes a weak one. What he aims 
at  is  not the  substance,  but  the  mere appearance  of  success.  Being no  man  15 
of  deep  designs,  pondering  on  no  combinations  of  long  standing,  pursuing 
no  great  object, he  embarks in difficulties  with a view to disentangle himself 
from  them  in  a  showy  manner.  He  wants  complications  to  feed  his  activity, 
and  when  he  finds  them  not  ready,  he  will create them.  He  exults in  show-
conflicts,  show-battles,  show-enemies,  diplomatic  notes  to  be  exchanged,  20 
ships to be ordered to  sail, all ending in violent parliamentary debates, which 
are  sure  to prepare for  him an ephemeral success—the constant and exclusive 
object  of  all his  exertions.  He  manages  international conflicts like  an  artist, 
driving  matters  to  a  certain point, retreating when they threaten to  become 
serious, but having got, at all events, the dramatic excitement he desires. The  25 
history of the world is, in his eyes, a pastime, expressly invented for the noble 
Viscount  Palmerston  of  Palmerston.  He  is  a  great  sample  of  that  species 
designated  by  Thomas  Carlyle  as  the  sham  captains  of  the  world. 

Yielding  to  foreign  influence  in  fact,  he  opposes  it  in words.  Having  in 

herited  from  Canning  England's  mission  of  propagating  Constitutionalism  30 
on  the  continent,  he  never  lacks  a  theme  to  pique  the  national  prejudices, 
so  as  to  counteract revolution abroad,  and,  at the  same time to keep  awake 
the  suspicious  jealousy  of  foreign  powers.  Having  succeeded  in  this  easy 
manner  in becoming the  bête noire of the continental courts, he could not 
fail  to  be  set  up  as  the  truly  English minister  at home.  Although a Tory by  35 
origin, he has introduced into the management of foreign affairs all the shams 
that  form  the  essence  of  Whiggism.  He  knows  how  to  conciliate  a  large 
phraseology  with  narrow  views,  how  to  clothe  the  policy  of  a  peace-
mongering  middle-class  in  the  haughty  language  of  England's  aristocratic 
past,  how to  appear an aggressor where  he  yields,  and a defender where he  40 
betrays,  how  to  manage  his  apparent  enemy,  and  how  to  exasperate  his 

358 

Lord  Palmerston  ·  Palmerston 

pretended  ally,  how  to  find  himself,  at  the  opportune  moment,  on  the  side 
of  the  stronger  against  the  weak,  and  how  to  utter  brave  words  in  the  act 
of  running  away. 

Accused by  one  party  of being in the pay of Russia, he is  supposed by the 
5  others  to  be  made  up  of Carbonarism.  If, in  1848, he  had to  defend himself 
against  a  motion  of  impeachment for  having  acted  as the  minister of Nicho 
las,  he  had,  in  1850,  the  satisfaction of being persecuted by  a conspiracy of 
foreign embassadors, which was  successful in the House of Lords but baffled 
in the  House  of  Commons.  If  he has betrayed foreign peoples, he did it with 
10  great politeness, politeness being the  small coin of the  devil, which he gives 
in change  for the  life-blood of his dupes. If the oppressors were always  sure 
of  his  active  support,  the  oppressed  never  lacked  a great  ostentation  of his 
rhetorical  generosity.  Poles,  Italians,  Hungarians,  Germans,  found  him  in 
office,  whenever they were crushed,  but their despots  suspected him always 
15  of  secret conspiracy with the victims  he  had already allowed them to make. 
At  all  events,  it has  been till  now  a probable chance  of  success to  have  him 
for  one's  adversary,  and  a  sure  chance  of  ruin to  have  him  for  one's  friend. 
But,  if his  art  of  diplomacy  does not shine in the actual results of his foreign 
negotiations,  it shines the more brilliantly in the construction he has induced 
the  English people  to  lay  upon them,  by accepting phrases for facts, phan 
toms  for  realities,  and  high-sounding  pretexts  for  shabby  motives.

Henry John Temple, Viscount Palmerston, deriving his title from a peerage 
of  Ireland,  was  nominated  Lord of the  Admiralty in  1807,  on the  formation 
of  the  Duke  of Portland's  administration.  In  1809 he was  created  Secretary 
25  at War, and continued to hold this office till May,  1828. In 1830 he went over 
to  the  Whigs,  who  made  him  their  permanent  minister  of  Foreign  Affairs. 
Excepting  the  intervals  of  Tory  administration  from  November,  1834,  till 
April,  1835,  and  from  1841  to  1846,  he  is  responsible  for  the whole foreign 
policy  of  England  from  the  revolution  of  1830  till  December,  1851. 

30 

Is  it  not  a  very  curious  thing to  find,  at first  view,  this  Quixotte  of free 
institutions  and  this  Pindar  of  the  "glories  of  the  constitutional  system,"  a 
permanent  and  active  member  of the Tory Administrations  of Mr. Perceval, 
the Earl of Liverpool,  Mr. Canning, Lord Goderich and the Duke of Welling 
ton,  during  the  fatal  epoch when  the  Anti-Jacobin war  was  carried  on,  the 
35  monster debt contracted, the corn laws enacted, foreign troops  stationed in 
England, the people  "Weeded" from time to time, the press gagged, meetings 
suppressed, the mass of the nation disarmed, individual liberty together with 
the  regular  jurisdiction  of  the  courts,  suspended,  the  whole  country placed 
as  it  were  under  a  state  of  siege—in one word,  during the most infamous and 

40  most reactionary  epoch  of  English  history? 

His  debut  in  Parliamentary  life  was  of  a  no  less  characteristic  sort.  On 

359 

Karl  Marx 

February  3,  1808,  he  rose  to  defend—what?  Secresy  in  diplomatic  negoti 
ations,  and  the  most  disgusting  act  ever  committed  by  any  nation  against 
another  nation,  namely,  the  bombardment  of  Copenhagen  and  the  capture 
of  the  Danish fleet  at  a time  when  England was  supposed  to  be in profound 
peace  with  Denmark.  As  to  the  first  point,  he  stated that, in this particular 
case,  his  Majesty's  ministers  "are  pledged  to  secrecy,"  but he  improved  on 
this  statement:  "I  also  object  generally  to  making  public  the  working  of 
diplomacy,  because  it  is  the  tendency  of  disclosures  in  that  department  to 
shut  up  future  sources  of  information."  Vidocq  would  have  defended  the 
identical  cause  in  the  identical  terms.  As  to  the  act of  piracy  itself,  while  10 
admitting that Denmark had evidenced no hostility whatever to Great Britain, 
he  justified  the  bombarding  its  capital  and  the  stealing  its  fleet  on the plea 
that  it had been done to  prevent Danish neutrality from being converted into 
open  hostility  on the compulsion of France. This was  the  new law of nations 
he  proclaimed.

When  again  speechifying,  we  find  this  English  minister  par  excellence 
engaged  in  the  defense  of the foreign troops, called over from the Continent 
to  England  with the  express  mission  of  maintaining  forcibly  the  oligarchic 
rule,  to  establish which William had come  over in 1688, accompanied by his 
Dutch  troops.  To  the  well-founded  "apprehensions  for  the  liberties  of  the  20 
country,"  originating  from  the  presence  of  the  King's  German  Legion, 
Palmerston  answered with great  flippancy  of  manner:  "Why  should  we  not 
have  16,000  of  those  foreigners  at  home,  while  you  know  that  we  employ 
a far larger proportion of foreigners abroad?" When similar "apprehensions" 
arose  from  the  large  standing  army,  maintained  since  1815  in  England,  he  25 
found  "a  sufficient  protection  of  the  constitution  in the  very constitution of 
our  army,"  a  large  proportion  of  the  officers  being  "men  of  property  and 
connections."  When  the  large  standing  army was  attacked  from  a financial 
point of view, he made the curious  discovery, that "much of our commercial 
embarrassment  has  been  caused  by  our  former  low  peace  establishment."  30 
When  the  "burdens  of  the  country"  and  the  "misery  of  the  people"  were 
contrasted  with  the  vast  military  expenditure,  he  reminded Parliament that 
those  burdens  and  that  misery  "were  the  price  which  we  (the  English  Oli 
garchy)  agreed  to  pay  for  our freedom  and  independence." 

If  in his  eyes,^nilitary despotism was to be apprehended, it was only from  35 

the  exertions  of  "those  self-called  but  misled  reformers  who  demand  that 
sort  of  reform  in  the  country  which,  according  to  every  just  principle  of 
government,  must  end, if it were acceded to, in a military despotism." While 
large  standing  armies  were thus his panacea for maintaining the  constitution 
of  the  country,  corporal  punishment  and  flogging  were  his  panacea  for  40 
maintaining the  constitution of the army. He defended flogging in the debates

on  the  Mutiny  bill  on  March  5,1824;  he  declared it to  be  "absolutely  indis­
pensable"  on March  11,1825;  he  recommended  it  again  on March  10,1828; 
he  stood by it in the debates of April,  1833,  and he has proved a true  amateur 
of  flogging  on  every  subsequent occasion.  There  has  existed  no  abuse  in the 
army  which  he  would not gift with plausible  reasons,  if it happened to foster 
the  momentary  interests  of  aristocratic  parasites.  An  instance  of  this  may 
be  found  in  the  debates  on  the  sale  of  half-pay  commissions,  on  March  12, 
1828.

Lord  Palmerston  likes  to  parade  his  constant  exertions  for  the  establish-
10  ment  of  religious  liberty.  Now,  he voted against Lord John Russell's  motion 
for  the  "Repeal of the  Test and Corporation Acts, " and why?  Because  he 
was  "a  warm  and  zealous  friend  to  religious  liberty,  and  could,  therefore, 
not allow  the  Dissenters  to  be  relieved  from  imaginary  grievances, while real 
inflictions  pressed  upon  the  Catholics."  "I  regret,"  he  informs  us,  " to  see 
the  increasing  number  of  Dissenters.  It  is  my  wish  that  the  Established 
Church  should be  the  predominant  one  in this country;"  and from pure love 
and  zeal  for  religious  liberty  he  wants  this  Established  Church  to  be  fed  at 
the  expense  of  the  misbelievers.  His  jocose  Lordship  accuses  the  rich  Dis­
senters  of  satisfying  the  ecclesiastical  wants  of  the  poorer  ones,  while  "with 
20 the Church of England it is the poor alone who want church accomodations ; 
it would be preposterous  to  say  that the poor ought to  subscribe for churches 
out  of  their  small  earnings."  It  would  of  course  be  yet  more  preposterous 
to  say  that  the  rich  members  of  the  Established  Church ought to  subscribe 
for  churches  out  of  their  large  earnings.

Let  us  now  look  at  his  exertions  for  Catholic  Emancipation-one  of  his 
great  aims  having  been  to  gain  the  gratitude  of  the  Irish  people.  We  do  not 
dwell on the circumstance that, having declared himself for Catholic Emanci­
pation  when  a  member  of  the  Canning ministry,  he nevertheless  entered the 
Wellington ministry  avowedly  hostile  to  that measure.  Did Lord Palmerston, 
then  consider  religious  liberty  as  one  of  the  rights  of  man,  not  to  be  inter­
meddled  with  by  legislation?  He  may  answer  for  tiimself :  "Although  I  wish 
the Catholic claims to be considered,  I never will admit these claims to  stand 
upon the ground of right. If I thought the Catholics were asking for their right, 
I,  for  one,  would not go  into the  Committee."  And why  did he  oppose their 
asking for  their  right?  "Because  the  legislature  of  a country  has  the  right to 
impose  such  political  disabilities  upon  any  class  of the community  as it may 
deem  necessary  for  the  safety  and  the  welfare  of  the  whole.  This  belongs 
to the  fundamental principles on which  a civilized government is founded." 
Here,  then,  we  have  the  most  cynical  confession  ever  made,  that  the  mass 
40  of  the  people  have  no  rights  at all,  but that they  may  enjoy that  quantity of 
immunities  the  legislature,  or  in other  words,  the  ruling  class,  may  deem  fit 

35 

361 

Karl  Marx 

to  grant  them.  In  accordance  with  this,  Lord  Palmerston  declared  in  plain 
words,  "Catholic  Emancipation  to  be  a  measure  of  grace  and  favor." 

5 

It was  then  entirely  upon  the  ground of expediency that he condescended 
to  discontinue  the  Catholic  disabilities.  And  what  was  lurking  behind  this 
expediency?  Being  himself  one  of  the  great  Irish  landed  proprietors,  he 
wanted  to  entertain  the  delusion  that  "other  remedies  for  Irish  evils  than 
-Emancipation  are  impossible;"  that  it  would  cure  Absenteeism,  and  prove 
a  cheap  substitute  for  poor  laws.  This  great  philanthropist,  who  afterward 
cleared  his  Irish  estates  of  their  Irish  natives,  could  not  allow Irish  misery 
to  darken,  even for one  moment, with its inauspicious clouds, the bright sky  10 
over the  Parliament of landlords  and money lords.  "It is true," he exclaims, 
"that  the  peasantry  of  Ireland  do  not  enjoy  all  the  comforts  which  are 
enjoyed by the peasantry of England." Only think of all the comforts enjoyed 
by  a family  at the  rate  of  seven shillings a week.  "Still," he continues, "still, 
however,  the  Irish  peasant  has  his  comforts.  He  is well  supplied with fuel,  15 
and  is  seldom  (only  five  days  out  of  six)  at a loss for food."  But this  is  not 
all  the  comfort  he  has.  He  has  a  greater  "cheerfulness  of  mind"  than  his 
English fellow-sufferer.  As to the extortions of Irish landlords, he  deals with 
them  in  a no less  pleasant way than with the comforts of the Irish peasantry. 
"It is  said that the  Irish landlord insists  on the highest possible rent that can  20 
be extorted. Why, Sir, I believe that is not a singular circumstance. Certainly, 
in  England the landlord  does the  same  thing."  Are  we,  then,  to be surprised 
that  this  man,  so  deeply  initiated  into  the  mysteries  of  "the  glories  of  the 
English  Constitution"  and  the  comforts  of  "free  institutions,"  aspires  at 
spreading them  all  over  the  Continent? 

25 

It is  known that,  when the Reform-movement had grown irresistible, Lord 
Palmerston  deserted  the  camp  of  the  Tories,  and  skilfully effected his junc 
tion  with  the  Whigs.  We  have  seen  that  he  once  apprehended  danger  of 
the  self-called  Reformers. 
the  demands  of 
military  despotism  from 
Nevertheless,  as  early as  1828,  he patronised  the  extension of the franchise  30 
to  such  large  industrial  places  as Birmingham,  Leeds, and Manchester,  "not 
because I am  a friend  to Reform  in principle,  but because lam its decided 
enemy,"  calculating  that  some  timely  compromise  with  the  overgrown 
factory-kings might be the only way of escaping "the introduction of general 
reform. "Having passed  over to the Whigs,  he did not even pretend that their 
Reform  bill  aimed  at  breaking through  the  narrow  trammels of the Venetian 
Constitution,  but,  on the contrary,  at increasing its  strength  and  solidity, by 
severing the middle-class interest from the people's opposition.  "The feelings 
of  the  middle  classes  will  be  changed,  and their  dissatisfaction will be  con 
verted  into  that  attachment  to  the  Constitution,  which will  give to  it a vast  40 
increase of  strength and  solidity."  He consoled the Peers by telling them that 

35 

362 

Lord  Palmerston  ·  Palmerston 

5 

the  Reform bill would neither weaken "the influence of the House of Lords," 
nor  put  a  stop  to  its  "interfering in elections."  He  told  the Aristocracy that 
the  Constitution  was  not  to  lose  its  feudal  character,  "the  landed  interest 
being  the  great  foundation  upon  which  rests  the  fabric  of  society  and  the 
institutions  of  the  country."  He  allayed  their fears  by  throwing out ironical 
hints  that  "we  have  been  charged  with  not  being in earnest or  sincere in our 
desire  to  give  to  the  people  a real representation,"  that  "it was  said we only 
proposed  to  give  a  different  form  of  influence  to  the  aristocracy  and  the 
landed  interest."  He  even  went  so  far  as  to  own that,  beside  the  inevitable 
10  concessions  to  be  made  to  the  overgrown  manufacturing  interest,  "dis 
franchisement,"  that is  to  say,  a  new kind of distribution of rotten boroughs 
between  the  Tory  Aristocrats  and  the  Whig  Aristocrats  was  the  chief  and 
leading  principle  of  the  Reform  bill. 

We  will  now  return  to  his  performances  in  the  foreign  branch  of  policy 
15  during  the  Tory  period  of  his  Ufe.  In  1823,  when,  in  consequence  of  the 
resolutions  of  the  Congress  of  Verona,  a  French  army  was  marched  into 
Spain,  in  order  to  overturn  the  Constitution  of  that  country  and  to  deliver 
it  up  to  the  merciless  vengeance  of  the  Bourbon idiot  and  his  suite  of bigot 
monks,  Lord  Palmerston  disclaimed  any  Quixotic  crusade  for  "abstract 
20  principles"—any  intervention  in favor  of  a people  whose  heroic  resistance 
had  saved England from Napoleon, The words he addressed on that occasion 
to his Whig opponents are a true and lively picture of his own foreign policy, 
after  he  had become  their  permanent  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs.  "Some," 
said  he,  "would have had us use threats in negotiation without being prepared 
for  going  to  war,  if  negotiation  failed.  To  have  talked  of  war  and  to  have 
meant  neutrahty—to  have  threatened  an army and  to  have  retreated  behind 
a  state-paper—to  have  brandished  the  sword  of  defiance  in  the  hour  of 
deliberation  and  to  have  ended  in  a  penf  ul  of  protests  on  the  day  of  battle, 
would  have  been the  conduct  of  a  cowardly  bully,  and  would  have  made us 
the  object  of  contempt  and  the  laughing-stock  of  Europe." 

25 

30 

At last we  arrive  at the  Grecian and Turkish debates, which afforded Lord 
Palmerston  the  first  opportunity  of  displaying  publicly  bis  talents  as  the 
unflinching  and  persevering  advocate  of  Russia  in  the  Cabinet  and  in  the 
House.  One by one he reechoed the watchwords given by Russia, of Turkish 
35  monstrosity—Greek  civilization,  religious  liberty,  Christianity,  etc.  At first 
we  meet  him  repudiating,  as  the  Minister  of  War,  any  intention  of  passing 
a  censure  "upon  the  meritorious  conduct  of  Admiral  Codrington,"  which 
caused the  destruction of the Turkish fleet at Navarino, although he admitted 
that  "the  battle  took  place  against  a  power  with  which we  are  not at war." 
40  After this,  having left office,  he opened his long series of attacks upon Lord 
Aberdeen  by  reproaching  him  with having been to  slow  in the  execution of 

363 

Karl  Marx 

the  Czar's  orders.  "Has  there  been  much  more  energy  and  promptitude  in 
fulfilling our engagements to Greece? July,  1829, is coming fast upon us, and 
the  treaty  of  July,  1827,  is  still  unexecuted.  The  Morea  indeed,  has  been 
cleared of the Turks, but why were the arms of France checked at the Isthmus 
of  Corinth?  The  narrow policy  of  England  stepped in and  arrested her pro- 
gress.  But why  do  not  the  allies  deal with the  country north of the  Isthmus 
as they have done with that to the  South, by occupying at once all that which 
must  be  assigned  to  Greece?  I  should  have  thought  that  the  allies  had  had 
enough  of  negotiating  with  Turkey  about  Greece." 

5 

It  is  well  known  that  it was Prince Metternich, who  at that time opposed  10 

the  encroachments  of Russia,  and that her diplomatic agents, such as Pozzo 
di  Borgo,  Prince  Lieven  and  others,  had  accordingly  received  orders  to 
denounce Austria, as the  stupid ally of the  Sultan. Lord Palmerston followed 
of  course  in  the  beaten  track:  "By  the  narrowness  of  her  views,  the  un 
fortunate prejudices  of her policy, Austria has almost reduced herself to the 
level  of a second-rate power,"  and in consequence of the temporizing policy 
of  Aberdeen,  "England  is  now  represented  as  the  keystone  of that arch of 
which Miguel  and  Spain and Austria and Mahmud, are the component parts. 
It  is  thus  that  people  see  in  the  delay  in executing the treaty  of July  not  so 
much  fear  of  Turkish  resistance,  as  invincible  repugnance  to  Grecian free-  20 
dorn." 

15 

For  half  a  century  one  phrase  has  stood  as  a  barrier  between  Russia  and 
Constantinople—the  phrase  of  the  integrity  of  the  Turkish  Empire  being 
necessary to the balance of power. "I object" exclaims Palmerston on Feb. 5, 
1830, "to the policy of making the integrity of the Turkish dominion in Europe 25 
an  object  essentially  necessary  to  the  interests  of  Christian  and  civilized 
Europe."  Again  he  returns  to  attack  Aberdeen:  "I,  for  one,  shall  not  be 
satisfied  with  a  number  of  dispatches  from  the  Government  of  England, 
which  will  no  doubt  read  well and  smooth enough, urging in general terms, 
the  propriety  of  conciliating  Russia,  but  accompanied,  perhaps,  by  strong  30 
expressions  of  the  regard  which  England bears  to Turkey, which when read 
by  an interested party,  might easily  be made  to appear more than was really 
intended.  I  should  like to  see, that while England adopted a firm resolution— 
almost  the  only  course  she  could  adopt—upon  no  consideration  and  in  no 
event to take  part with Turkey in that war,  that that  decision was  fairly and  35 
frankly  communicated  to  the  Turk.  There  are  three  merciless  things:  time, 
fire  and  the  Sultan." 

Before  proceeding further,  let us  recall  to  memory  a few  historical facts: 
Russia  having  seized  on  Gokcheh,  a  strip  of  land  bordering  on  the  lake  of 
Sevan,  (the  undisputed  possession  of Persia,) demanded, as the price of its  40 
evacuation,  the  abandonment  of  Capan—another  portion  of  the  Persian 

364

territory.  Persia  not  yielding,  was  overrun,  vanquished,  and  forced to  sub 
scribe  to  the  treaty  of  Turcomanchai,  in  February,  1828.  According to  this 
treaty,  Persia  had to  pay  an indemnity  of two  millions  sterling to  Russia,  to 
cede  the  provinces  of  Erivan  and  Nuktchivan,  including  the  fortresses  of 
5  Erivan and Abassabad, in order to define the common frontier by the Araxes; 
this  being  the  only  means,  as  Nicholas  pretended,  of preventing  any future 
disputes  between the two  empires.  But  at the  same time, he refused to give 
back  Talish  and  Moghan,  situated  beyond  the  Russian  side  of  the  Araxes. 
Finally, Persia was also bound to maintain no navy on the Caspian Sea. Such 
10  were  the  origin  and  the results of the Russo-Persian war.  As  to the religion 
and  the  liberty  of  Greece,  Russia  cared,  then,  as  much  about  them,  as  the 
"God of the Russians" cares now about the keys of the Holy Sepulchre, and 
the  famous  Cupola.  It  was  the  traditional  policy  of  Russia  to  excite  the 
Grecians to revolt,  and then to  abandon them to the vengeance of the Sultan. 
15  So  profound  was  her  sympathy  for  the  regeneration  of  Hellas,  that  she 
treated them as rebels at the Congress of Verona, acknowledging the Sultan's 
right  to  exclude  all  foreign  intervention  between  himself  and  his  Christian 
subjects.  In  fact,  the  Czar  "offered  to  aid  the  Porte  in  suppressing  the 
Greek  rebellion"—a  proposition  which  was,  of  course,  rejected.  Having 
failed in this  attempt,  he turned round upon the great Powers, by proposing 
"to  march an army into Turkey, for the purpose of dictating peace under the 
walls of the  Seraglio." But, in order to hold his hands bound by common act, 
the Powers concluded with him a treaty at London, on July 6,1827, by which 
they mutually engaged  to  enforce  the  adjustment of the  differences between 
25  Turkey and Greece. A few months after signing that treaty, Russia concluded 
with  Turkey  the  treaty  of  Akerman,  on  the  express  understanding that  she 
should  renounce  all  interference  in  Greece.  This  treaty  had  been  brought 
about  after  Russia  had  induced  the  Prince  Royal  of  Persia  to  invade  the 
Ottoman  dominions,  and  after  she  had inflicted  the  greatest injuries  on the 

20 

30  Porte, in order to drive it to a rupture.  All this having taken place, the reso 

lutions  of  the  London  treaties  of  July  6,  1827,  were  presented  one  fine 
morning,  to  the  Porte,  in  the  name  of  Russia  and  the  other  Powers. 

In  consequence  of  the  complications  resulting  from  the  Russian lies  and 
frauds,  the  Czar  at  last  found  a  pretext  to  begin  the  war  of  1828  and  1829. 
35  This  was  terminated  by  the  treaty  of  Adrianople,  whose  substance  is  con 
tained  in the following quotation from  McNeill's celebrated pamphlet on the 
progress  of  Russia  in  the  East: 

"By  the  treaty  of  Adrianople  the  Czar  acquired  Anapa  and  Poti,  with  a 
considerable  extent  of  coast  on  the  Black  Sea,  a portion  of the Pachalik of 
40  Akhilska,  with  the  two  fortresses  of  Akhilska  and  Akhilkillak,  the  islands 
formed by  the mouth of the Danube. The destruction of the Turkish fortress 

365 

Karl  Marx 

of  Georgiova  and  the  abandonment  by  Turkey  of  the  right  bank  of  the 
Danube  to  the  distance  of  several  miles  from  the  river,  were  stipulated— 
partly by force,  and partly by the  influence  of the priesthood many thousand 
families of the Armenians were removed from the Turkish provinces in Asia 
to  the  Czar's  territories.  He  established  for  his  own  subjects  in  Turkey  an 
exemption  from  all  responsibility  to  the  national  authorities,  and  burdened 
the  Porte  with  an  immense debt under the name of expenses for the war and 
for  commercial  losses,  and  finally  retained  Moldavia  and  Wallachia  and 
Silistria in pledge for its payment. Having by this treaty imposed upon Turkey 
the acceptance of the protocol of March 22, which secured to her the suzerai- 10 
neté  of  Greece,  and  a  yearly  tribute  from  this  country,  Russia  used  all her 
influence to  procure  the  independence of Greece which was indeed erected 
into  an  independent  state;  of  which  Count  Capo  d'Istria,  who  had  been  a 
Russian Minister, was named Presií/ení." 

5 

These  are  the facts. Now look at the picture drawn of them by the master-  15 

hand of Lord Palmerston in a  speech in the  House  of Commons on Feb.  16, 
1830:  "It  is  perfectly true that the war between Russia and Turkey arose out 
of  aggressions  made  by  Turkey  on the  commerce  and rights  of Russia,  and 
violations  of  treaties."  We  find  him,  however,  as  the  Whig  Minister  of 
Foreign Affairs improving on this theme:  "The honorable and gallant mem-  20 
ber  (Col.  Evans)  has  represented  the  conduct of Russia as one of unvarying 
aggression  upon  other  States,  from  1815  to  the  present  time.  He  adverted 
more  particularly  to  the  wars  of  Russia with Persia  and  Turkey.  Russia was 
the  aggressor  in  neither  of  them,  and  although the  result  of the  Persian war 
was an aggrandizement of her power, it was not a result of her own seeking. 25 
Again, in the Turkish war Russia was  not the aggressor.  It would be fatiguing 
to  the  House  to  detail  all  the  provocations  Turkey  offered to  Russia; but I 
believe  there  cannot  be  a  doubt  that  she  violated  all  the  provisions  of  the 
treaty of Ackerman,  and then, upon complaint made, denied redress; so that, 
if ever there  was  a just ground for going to  war Russia had it for going to  30 
war with Turkey. She did not, however, on that occasion acquire any increase 
of territory, at least, in Europe.  I know that there was a continued occupation 
of  certain  points  (Moldavia  and  Wallachia  are  only  points,  and the  mouths 
of  the  Danube  are  mere  zeros,)  and  some  additional  acquisitions  on  the 
Euxine  in Asia, but she had an agreement with the other  European powers,  35 
that success in that war should not lead to any aggrandizement in Europe." 

Our readers will now understand  Sir Robert Peel's telling Lord Palmerston 
in a public  session of the  House, that "he  did not know whose representative 
he  was."  This  was  a  plain  way  of  saying  he  was  not  the  representative  of 
liberty,  or  honesty,  or  what  makes  the  best  character  of  England.  Such  as  40 
the  noble  lord was  then,  and  in the  earlier part of his  career which we  have 

366 

Lord  Palmerston  -  Palmerston  and  Russia 

reviewed,  he is  at this  day,  and none  who  know him can expect at his hands 
any but false  service  to  the  cause  of  justice  and  human rights in the present 
momentous  crisis.  What  remains  of his  public  history we leave  for  another 
day;  we  are  sorry  to  say  that  it  is  not  the  better  half.

At  a  recent  meeting  in  London,  to  protest  against  the  action  of  the British 
Ministry,  in  the  present  controversy  between  Russia  and Turkey,  a gentle 
man who presumed to find special fault with Lord P a l m e r s t o n,  was  saluted 
and  silenced  by  a storm of indignant hisses.  The  meeting  evidently thought 
that if Russia had a friend in the Ministry it was not the noble Viscount, and 
would  no  doubt  have  rent  the  air  with  cheers,  had  some  one  been  able  to 
announce  that  his  Lordship  had  become  Prime  Minister.  This  astonishing 
confidence  in  a  man  so  false  and  hollow,  is  another  proof  of the  ease  with 
which  people  may  be  imposed  on  by  brilliant  abilities,  and  a new  evidence 
15  of the  necessity  of taking  off the  mask from this wily enemy to the progress 
of  human  freedom.  Accordingly,  with  the  history  of  trie  last  twenty-five 
years,  and  the  debates  of  Parliament  for  guides,  we  proceed  with  the  task 
of  exposing  the  real  part  which  this  accomplished  actor  has  performed  in 
the  drama  of  modern  Europe. 

20 

The noble Viscount is generally known as  the chivalrous protector of the 
Poles,  and  never  fails  of  giving  vent  to  his  painful  feelings  with  regard  to 
Poland, before  the  deputations  which are  once  every year presented  to  him 
by  "dear  dully-deadly"  Dudley  Stuart,  who  has been  described by  one,  not 
too  friendly or  too  just to  his  Lordship,  as  "a worthy who  makes  speeches, 
25  passes resolutions, votes addresses, goes up with deputations, has at all times 
the  necessary  quantity  of  confidence  in  the  necessary  individual,  and  can 
also,  if  necessary,  give  three  cheers  for  the  Queen." 

The Poles  had  been in arms for about a month when Lord Palmerston came 
into office, in November,  1830. As early as August 8,1831, Mr. Hunt presents 
to  the  House  a  petition  from  the  Westminster  Union  in favor of  the  Poles, 
and  "for  the  dismissal  of  Lord  Palmerston  from  His  Majesty's  councils." 
Mr.  Hume  stated  on the  same  day  that he  concluded from the silence of the 
noble  Lord  that  the  Government  "intended to  do  nothing  for the  Poles,  but 
allow  them  to  remain  at  the  mercy  of  Russia."  To  this  Lord  Palmerston 
replied,  "that  whatever  obligations  existing  treaties  imposed  would  at  all 

30 

35 

367 

Karl  Marx 

times receive the attention of the Government." Now what sort of obligations 
were,  in his opinion, imposed upon England by existing treaties?  "The claim 
of Russia to the possession of Poland bears the date of the Treaty of Vienna," 
he tells  us,  in a  speech made in the House of Commons, on July 9,1833 ; and 
that treaty makes this possession dependent on the observance of the Polish 
Constitution  by  the  Czar.  But from  a  subsequent  speech  we  learn that  "the 
mere  fact  of  this  country  being  a  party  to  the  treaty  of  Vienna  was  not 
synonymous  with  our  (England's)  guaranteeing  that  there  would  be  no  in 
fraction of that treaty by Russia." That is to  say, you may guarantee a treaty, 
without guaranteeing that it shall be observed. This is the principle on which  10 
the  Milanese  said  to  the  Emperor  Barbarossa:  "If  you  have  had  our  oath 
remember  that  we  never  swore  to  keep  it." 

5 

15 

In one respect the treaty of Vienna was good enough.  It gave to the British 
Government,  as  one  of  the  contracting  parties,  "a  right  to  entertain  and 
express  an opinion on any  act which tends to a violation of that treaty.—The 
contracting  parties  to  the  treaty  of  Vienna  had  a  right  to  require  that  the 
Constitution  of  Poland  should  not be  touched,  and  this  is  an  opinion which 
I  have  not  concealed  from  the  Russian  Government.  I  communicated  it by 
anticipation  to  that  Government  previous  to  the  taking  of  Warsaw,  and 
before  the  result  of  hostilities  was  known.  I  communicated  it  again  when  20 
Warsaw  fell.  The  Russian  Government,  however,  took  a  different view  of 
the  question."  So  said  our  hero  on  the  9th  of  July,  1833.  He  had  quietly 
anticipated  the  downfall  of  Poland,  and  had  availed  himself  of  the  opportu 
nity  to  entertain  and  express  an  opinion  on  certain  articles  of the treaty of 
Vienna,  persuaded  as  he  was,  that the  Czar  was  merely  waiting till  he had  25 
crushed  the  Polish  people  by  armed  force,  to  do  homage  to  a Constitution 
he  had  trampled  upon  when  they  were  yet possessed  of  unbounded  means 
of resistance.  At the  same time the noble Lord charged the Poles with having 
"taken  the  uncalled-for  and  in  his  opinion  unjustifiable  step  of  the  de 
thronement  of  the  Emperor.  He  could  also  say  that  the  Poles  were  the  30 
aggressors,  for  they  commenced the  contest." 

When  the  apprehensions  that  Poland  would  be  extinguished  became 
universal  and  troublesome,  he  declared that  "to  exterminate Poland,  either 
morally  or  politically,  is  so  perfectly  impracticable,  that  I  think there  need 
be  no  apprehension  of  its  being  attempted."  When  afterward  reminded  of  35 
the  vague  expectation thus  held out,  he  averred  that he  had been misunder 
stood,  and  that  he  said  so,  not in the  political, but the  Pickwickian  sense  of 
the  word,  meaning  that  "the  Emperor  of  Russia  was  unable  to  physically 
exterminate  so  many  milhons  of  men  as the  Polish  Kingdom,  in its  divided 
state contained." When the House threatened to interfere duringthe struggle  40 
in favor of the  Poles,  he  appealed to his ministerial responsibility. When the 

368 

Lord  Palmerston  ·  Palmerston  and  Russia 

thing was  done,  he  told  them  coolly that "no vote of that House would have 
the  slightest  effect in reversing the  decision  of Russia." When the atrocities 
committed  by  the  Russians,  after  the  fall  of  Warsaw,  were  denounced,  he 
recommended the  House  to  cherish  a great tenderness  toward the Emperor 
5  of  Russia,  declaring  that  "no  person  could  regret  more  than  he  did,  the 
expressions  which  had been  uttered;"  that  "the  present  Emperor  of  Russia 
was  a  man  of  high  and  generous  feelings;"  that  "where  cases  of  undue 
severity  on  the  part  of  the  Russian  Government to  the  Poles  had  occurred, 
they might  set this  down  as a proof that the power of the  Emperor of Russia 
10  was practically limited,  and they  might take it for granted, that the Emperor 
had,  in  those  instances,  yielded  to  the  influences  of  others,  rather  than 
followed the  dictates of his  spontaneous feelings."  When on the one  side the 
utter  ruin  of  Poland  was  secured,  and  on  the  other  the  dissolution  of  the 
Turkish  Empire  became  imminent  from  the  progress  of  Ibrahim  Pasha,  he 
assured  the  House  that  "affairs  in general were proceeding in a satisfactory 
train."  A  motion  for  granting  subsidies  to  the  Polish  refugees  having  been 
made, it was  "exceedingly painful  to  him  to  oppose  the grant of  any money 
to  those  individuals,  which  the  natural  and  spontaneous  feelings  of  every 
generous  man would  lead  him  to  acquiesce  in,"  but  "it  was  not  consistent 
20  with his  duty to  propose  any grant of money to those unfortunate persons," 
this  same  tender-hearted  man  having  secretly  defrayed,  as  we  shall  see by 
and  by,  in  a  great  part,  the  cost  of  Poland's  fall  out  of  the  pockets  of  the 
English  people.  The  noble  Lord took good  care  to  withhold all  state  papers 
about  the  Polish catastrophe  from Parliament,  but  several  statements  made 
in  the  House  of  Commons,  which  he  has  never  so  much  as  attempted  to 
controvert,  leave  no  doubt  about  the  game  he  played  at  that fatal  epoch. 

15 

25 

After  the  Polish revolution  had  broken out,  the  Consul  of  Austria  did not 
quit  Warsaw,  and  his  Government  went  as  far  as  to  send  a  Polish  agent, 
Mr. Walewski  to  Paris,  for the purpose of negotiating with the Governments 
30  of  France  and of England,  about the re-establishment of  a Polish Kingdom. 
The  Court  of  the  Tuileries  declared  "it  was  ready  to  join  England  in  case 
of  her  consenting to  the project."  Lord Palmerston repudiated the proposal. 
In  1831,  M. de  Talleyrand,  the  then Ambassador  of  France  at  the  Court of 
St. James,  proposed  a  plan  of  combined  action  on  the  part  of  France  and 
35  England, but met with a distinct refusal, and with a note from the noble Lord 
stating  "that  an  amicable  intermediation  on  the  Polish  question  would  be 
declined  by  Russia;  that the  Powers  had  just  declined  a  similar  offer  on  the 
part  of  France, that the intervention of the two Courts, France and England, 
could  only  be  by  force  in  case  of  a  refusal  on  the  part  of  Russia,  and  that 
the amicable and  satisfactory relations between the Cabinet of St. James and 
the  Cabinet of  St. Petersburg  would  not  allow  His  British Majesty to under-

40 

369 

Karl  Marx 

take  such  an interference.  The  time  was  not  yet  come  to undertake  such a 
plan  with  success  against  the  will  of  a  sovereign,  whose  rights  were  indis 
putable." 

The  so-called  kingdom  of  Poland  having  disappeared  from  the  map  of 
Europe,  there  still remained a fantastic remnant of the  Polish nationality in 
the  free  town  of  Cracow.  The  Czar  Alexander,  during  the  general  anarchy 
resulting  from  the  downfall  of  the  French  empire,  had  not  conquered  the 
Duchy  of Warsaw,  but  simply  seized  upon  it and wished to keep it, together 
with  Cracow,  which  had  been  incorporated  in  the  Duchy  by  Bonaparte. 
Austria, once possessed of Cracow, wished to have it again. The Czar being  10 
unable  to  obtain  it  for  himself,  and  being  unwilling  to  cede  it  to  Austria, 
proposed to  constitute  it as a free town, and accordingly the treaty of Vienna 
contained  the  following  stipulation: 

5 

"The town of Cracow, with its territory, is to be forever af ree, independent 
and strictly neutral city, under the protection of Austria, Russia and Prussia, 
and  the  Courts  of  Russia,  Austria  and  Prussia  engage  to  respect,  and  to 
cause  to  be  always  respected,  the  neutrality  of  the  free  town  of  Cracow 
and  its  territory.  No  armed  force  shall  be  introduced  upon  any  pretense 
whatever." 

15 

In  1831, Cracow was temporarily occupied by Russian troops. This, how-  20 

ever,  was  considered  as  a transitory necessity  of  war,  and  in  the turmoil  of 
that  time  it was  not adverted upon.  In  1836,  Cracow was  again occupied  by 
the troops  of Russia, Austria and Prussia, on the pretext of their being obliged 
to  accomplish,  in  that  way,  the  expulsion of  some  Polish  refugees  from  the 
town  and  its  territory.  On this  occasion the  noble  Lord  abstained  from  all  25 
remonstrance  on the  ground,  as  he  stated,  in  1836 and in  1840,  "that it was 
difficult to give  effect to  our remonstrances."—As soon, however, as Cracow 
was  definitively  confiscated by  Austria,  a  simple  remonstrance appeared to 
him  to  be  "the  only  effectual  means."—In  March,  1836,  when interpellated 
on  the  occupation  of  Cracow,  he  declared  it  to  be  of  a  merely  transitory  30 
character.  In  fact,  so  palliative  and  apologetic  was  the  construction he  put 
on the  doings  of  his  three  northern  allies, that he felt himself obliged to  stop 
suddenly,  and interrupt the even tenor of his speech by the assertion: "I stand 
not up  here  to defend a measure, which, on the contrary, I must censure and 
condemn.  I  have  merely  stated those circumstances which, though they  do  35 
not  excuse  the  forcible  occupation  of  Cracow,  might  yet  afford  a  justi 
fication"  etc.  He  admitted  that the  treaty  of Vienna bound  the  three  powers 
to  abstain from  any step without the previous consent of England, but "they 
may  be  justly  said to  have paid an involuntary homage to the justice  and the 
plain  dealing  of  this  country  by  supposing  that  we  would  never  give  our  40 
assent  to  such  a  proceeding."

Mr.Patrick  M.Stewart,  however,  having  found  out  that  there  existed 
better  means  for  the  preservation  of  Cracow  than  the  "abstention  from 
remonstrance,"  moved,  on  April  20,1836,  that  the  Government  should  be 
ordered  to  send  a representative to  Cracow  as  Consul, there being  Consuls 
there  from  the  three  other  powers,  Austria,  Russia  and  Prussia.  The  joint 
arrival  at  Cracow  of  an  English  and  French  Consul  would  have  proved an 
event,  and  must,  in  any  case,  have  prevented  the  noble  lord from afterward 
declaring himself unaware  of the intrigues pursued at Cracow by the Austri 
ans, Russians  and Prussians.  He induced Mr. Stewart to withdraw his motion 
10  by  solemnly  promising  that the  Government  "intended  to  send  a  Consular 
Agent  to  Cracow."  On March 22,1837, being interpellated by Lord  Dudley 
Stuart  with  regard  to  that  promise,  he  answered  that  "he  had  altered  his 
intention,  and  had  not  sent  a  Consul  or  Agent to  Cracow, and  it was  not at 
present his  intention to  do  so." 

20 

15 

Lord  Dudley  Stuart having  given  notice  that  he  should  move  for  papers 
to elucidate this  singular transaction, the noble Viscount defeated the motion, 
by  the  simple process  of being absent,  and  causing the House to be  counted 
out  on  May  25,1837.  He  never  stated  why  or  wherefore he had not fulfilled 
his  pledge,  and  withstood  all  attempts  to  squeeze  out of  him  any papers  on 
the  subject.  Ten years  afterward,  when Cracow was  doomed,  and when the 
noble  Lord  was  again  asked  for  the  production  of  papers  relating  to  the 
non-appointment of a British Consul at Cracow, he declared that "the  subject 
had  no  necessary  connection  with  the  discussion  on  the  incorporation  of 
Cracow, and he saw no advantage in reviving an angry discussion on a subject 
25  which  had  only  a  passing  interest."  He  now  proved  true  to  his  opinion  on 
the  production  of  State  papers  as  expressed  on  March  17,1837  by  saying, 
"If the  papers  bear  upon  a question  now  under  consideration,  their produc 
tion  would  be  dangerous;  if  they  refer  to  questions  that  are  gone  by,  they 
can  obviously  be  of  no  use."  The  British  Government  was,  however, very 
exactly informed as to the  importance of Cracow, not only in a political, but 
also in a commercial point of view, the Consul at Warsaw, Col. du Plat, having 
reported  in  detail  thereupon. 

30 

Lord  Palmerston,  himself,  was  obliged  to  confess  in  the  House,  that the 
Cracow  insurrection  of  1846  had  been  intentionally  provoked  by  the  three 
35  great powers.  "He believed the original entrance of the Austrian troops into 
the  territory  of  Cracow,  was  in  consequence  of  an  application  from  the 
Government.  But  then  those  Austrian  troops  retired.  Why they retired had 
never  yet  been  explained.  With  them  retired  the  Government  and  the  au 
thorities  of  Cracow;  the  immediate,  at  least  the  early  consequence  of  that 
retirement,  was the establishment of a Provisional Government at Cracow." 
On the 22d of  February,  1846, the forces  of  Austria,  and  afterward those of 

40 

371 

Karl  Marx 

5 

Russia  and  Prussia,  took  possession  of  that  city.  On  the  26th  of February, 
the  Prefect  of  Tarnow  issued  his  proclamation  calling  on  the  peasants  to 
murder their landlords, promising them  "a sufficient recompense in money," 
which proclamation was  followed  by the  Gallician  atrocities and the massa 
cre of about 2,000 land-holders. On March 12, appeared the Austrian procla- 
mation  to  "the  faithful  Gallicians,  who  have  aroused  themselves  for  the 
maintenance  of  order  and  of  law,  and  destroyed  the  enemies  of order."  In 
the  official  Gazette  of  April  28,  Prince  Frederic  of  Schwartzenberg  stated 
officially  "that  the  acts  that  had  taken  place  had  been  authorized  by  the 
Austrian  Government,"  which,  of  course,  acted  on  a  common  plan  with  10 
Russia  and  Prussia.  Now,  after all these abominations had passed, the noble 
Lord  was  not  ashamed  to  declare  in  the  House,  that  "he  had  too  high  an 
opinion  of  the  sense  of  justice  and  of right, that  must animate the  Govern 
ments  of  Austria,  of  Prussia,  and of Russia, to believe that they can feel  any 
disposition  or  intention  to  deal  with  Cracow,  otherwise  than  Cracow  is  15 
entitled  by treaty engagements  to  be  dealt with."  For  him  the  only business 
then  in  hand  was  to  get  rid  of  Parliament,  whose  session  was  drawing to  a 
close.  He assured the Commons, that "on the part of the British Government 
everything  should be  done to insure a due respect being paid to the provisions 
of  the  treaty  of  Vienna."  When  Mr. Hume  uttered  a  doubt  about  Lord  20 
Palmerston's  "intention  to  cause  the  Austro-Russian  troops  to  retire  from 
Cracow,"  the  noble  Lord  begged  of  the  House  not  to  give  credence  to  the 
statements  made by Mr. Hume, as he was in possession of better information 
and  was  convinced  that  the  occupation  of  Cracow  was  only  a  temporary 
one. 

25 

The  Parliament  of  1846  having been got rid of in the  same  manner  as  the 
Parliament  of  1853,  out  came  the  Austrian proclamation  of  Nov. 11,  1846, 
incorporating  Cracow  into  the  Austrian  dominions.  When Parliament reas 
sembled  on January  19,1847,  it was informed by the  Q u e e n's  Speech that 
Cracow was  gone, but that in its  place there  existed  a protest on the  part of  30 
the  brave Palmerston.  But in order to  deprive his protest even of the appear 
ance  of  meaning  anything  at  all,  the  noble  Lord  had  contrived,  at that very 
epoch, to engage England in a quarrel with France on occasion of the Spanish 
marriages,  which came  very near bringing the two countries into collision—a 
performance  which  was  sharply  overhauled  by  Mr. Smith  O'Brien,  in  the  35 
House  of  Commons,  on  March  16,  1847.  When  the  French  Government 
applied  to  the  noble  Lord  for  cooperation  in  a  joint  protest  against  the  in 
corporation of  Cracow, Lord Normanby—under  the  instructions  of the noble 
Viscount—answered  that  the  outrage  of  which  Austria  had  been  guilty,  in 
annexing Cracow, was not greater than that of France, in effecting a marriage  40 
between the Duke of Montpensier and the  Spanish Infanta, the one act being 

372

a  violation  of  the  treaty  of  Vienna,  and  the  other  of  the  treaty  of  Utrecht. 
Now, the treaty of Utrecht which had been renewed in 1782, was definitively 
abrogated  by  the  Anti-Jacobin  war  and  had,  therefore,  ever  since  1792, 
ceased  to  be  operative.  There  was  no  man in the  House better informed of 
this  circumstance  than the  noble  lord,  as  he had stated himself to the House 
on the occasion of the debates on the blockades of Mexico and Buenos Ayres 
that  "the  provisions  of  the  treaty  of  Utrecht  had  long  since  lapsed  in  the 
variations  of  war,  with  the  exception  of  the  single  clause  relating  to  the 
boundaries  of  Brazil  and  French  Guiana,  because  that  clause  had  been  by 

io  express  words  incorporated  into  the  treaty  of  Vienna." 

But we have not yet exhibited all the exertions of the noble lord in resisting 

the  encroachments  of  Russia  upon  Europe. 

There  once  existed  a curious  convention between England,  Holland,  and 
Russia—the  so-called Russian-Dutch  Loan.  During the Anti-Jacobin war the 
15  Czar  Alexander  had  contracted  a  loan  with  the  Messrs.  Hope  &  Co.  at 
Amsterdam,  and  after  the  downfall  of  Bonaparte,  the  King  of  the  Nether 
lands,  "desirous  to  make  a  suitable  return  to  the  Allied  powers  for  having 
delivered  his  territory,"  and  for  having  annexed  to it  Belgium,  to  which he 
had  no  right  whatever,  obliged  himself,  as  the  other  powers  waived  their 
20  common claims  in favor  of Russia,  which was then in great need of money, 
to  execute  with that  power  a  convention  agreeing to  pay her,  by  successive 
installments,  the  25,000,000 florins  she  owed to the Messrs.  Hope.  England, 
in  order  to  cover  the  robbery  she  had  committed  on Holland  with regard  to 
the  colonies  of the  Cape  of Good Hope, of Demerara, Esquibo and Berbice, 
25  became a party to this convention, and bound herself to pay a certain propor 
tion  of  the  subsidy  granted to  Russia.  This  stipulation became  a part of the 
treaty  of  Vienna,  but  upon the  express  condition  "that  the  payment  should 
cease,  if  the  union  between  Holland  and  Belgium  were broken prior to  the 
liquidation  of  the  debt."  When  Belgium  separated  herself  by  a revolution 
from Holland, the latter, of course, refused to pay her portion, on the ground 
that the loan had been contracted to continue her in the undivided possession 
of the  Belgian provinces,  and that  she  no  longer  had the  sovereignty of that 
country.  On  the  other  hand  there  remained,  as Mr. Herries  stated  in Parlia 
ment,  "not the  smallest iota of claim on the part of Russia for the continuance 
35  of debt by England." Lord Palmerston, however, found it quite natural, that 
"at one  time  Russia should be paid for  supporting the union of Belgium with 
Holland,  and  that  at  another  time  she  should  be  paid  for  supporting  the 
separation  of  those  countries."  He  appealed  in  a  very  solemn  manner  for 
the  faithful  observance  of  treaties,  and  above  all,  of  the  treaty  of  Vienna, 
and he  contrived to  carry  a new Convention with Russia,  dated on Nov.  16, 
1831,  in  the  preamble  of which it is  expressly stated, that it was  contracted 

30 

40 

373 

Karl  Marx 

5 

"in  consideration  of  the  general  arrangements  of  the  Congress  of  Vienna, 
which remain  in  full  force."  When  the  convention, relating to  the Russian-
Dutch  Loan,  had  been  inserted  into  the  treaty  of  Vienna,  the  Duke  of 
Wellington  exclaimed,  "this  is  a masterstroke  of  diplomacy  on  the  part  of 
Lord  Castlereagh,  for  Russia has  been  tied  down to  the  observance  of the 
Vienna treaty by a pecuniary obligation." When Russia,  therefore, withdrew 
her  observance  of  the  treaty  of  Vienna,  by  the  confiscation  of  Cracow, 
Mr. Hume  moved  a resolution to  stop  any further annual payment to Russia 
from  the  British  treasury.  The  noble  Viscount,  however,  thought that,  al 
though  Russia  had  a  right  to  violate  the  treaty  of  Vienna  with  regard  to  10 
Poland, England must remain bound by that very treaty with regard to Russia. 
But this  is  not  the most extraordinary incident in these curious transactions. 
After  the  Belgian  revolution  had  broken  out,  and  before  Parliament  had 
granted  the  new  loan  to  Russia,  the  noble  Lord  defrayed  the  costs  of  the 
Russian  war  against  Poland,  under  the  pretext  of  paying  off  the  old  debt  15 
contracted  in  1815,  although we  can  state,  on  the  authority  of  the  greatest 
English lawyer, the then Sir Edward Sugden, now Baron St. Leonards, "that 
there  was  not  a  single debateable point in that question, and the government 
had  no power whatever to pay a shilling of the money;" and on the authority 
of  Sir Robert Peel, who  declared,  "that Lord Palmerston was not warranted  20 
by  law  in  advancing  the  money." 

Our  readers  will  now  understand  why  the noble Lord reiterates, on every 
occasion,  that  "nothing  can  be  more  painful  to  men  of  proper  feeling than 
discussions  turning on the  subject of  Poland."  They  can  also appreciate the 
degree  of  earnestness  he  is  now  likely  to  exhibit  in  resisting  the  en-  25 
croachments  of  the  power  he  has  so  uniformly  served.

There  are  those  who  expect  that  in  the  war  between  Turkey  and  Russia, 
which has  now begun, the British Government will at last abandon its system 
of half-way measures  and fruitless negotiations to  act with energy and effect  30 
in repelling the  Muscovite invader back from his prey  and from the universal 
dominion he dreams of.  Such an expectation may not be without some ground 
of abstract probability and policy to justify it; but how Utile real reason there 
is  for  it will appear to whoever ponders the facts below  set forth with regard 
to the past conduct of that English Minister who is thought to be most hostile  35 
to  the  advance  of  Russian  despotism  in  Europe.  Indeed,  most  people  in

England who are dissatisfied with the policy of the Government in the contest 
between Turkey  and  Russia,  fondly believe  that matters  would  be  in  a very 
different  state  if  Lord  Palmerston  had  the  control  of  them.  Such  per 
sons,  in  recalling  the  noble  Viscount's  history,  must leave blank the whole 
eventful period  from  1832 to  1847—a blank which we will fill up for their in 
struction.

The  great and ever-recurring theme  of the  Palmerstonian self-glorification 
is  the  services  rendered to  the  cause  of  Constitutional  freedom  all  over  the 
Continent.  It  must  be  admitted  that  the  world  is  indebted  to  him  for  the 
1 o constitutional model-kingdoms of Portugal, Spain and Greece. Having placed 
Portugal  at the disposition of that fattest of women, Maria da Gloria, backed 
by  a Coburg,  he  exclaimed in the  House  of Commons:  "Portugal must now 
be looked upon as one of the substantive Powers of Europe." The noble Lord 
had  hardly  uttered  these  words  when,  at  his  command,  six  British  ships-
15  of-the-line  anchored at Lisbon,  in order to protect the  substantive daughter 
of  Don  Pedro  from  the  Portuguese  people,  and  to  help  her  destroy  the 
constitution  she  had  sworn  to  defend.  Spain,  crushed  beneath  the  yoke  of 
another  Maria—the  she-wolf  of  Naples—"holds  out  to u s ,"  according  to  his 
sanguine  view  of  the  case,  "a  fair  and  legitimate  hope  that  she  may  yet 
20  become  what  she  has  proved  in  former  times—a  flourishing  and  even  a 
formidable  power  among  the  European  Kingdoms."  Nor  was  he  short  of 
apologetic reasons,  even for having placed the native country of Pericles and 
Sophocles  under the  sway of  an idiot Bavarian boy.  "King Otho belongs  to 
a  country  where  there  exists  a  free  constitution."  A  free  constitution  in 
25  Bavaria,  the  German  Bceotia!  This  passes  the  licentia poetica of rhetorical 
flourish,  the  legitimate  hopes  held  out by  Spain  and the  substantive  power 
of Portugal. As to  Belgium, all Lord Palmerston ever did for it was to burden 
it with  a part of the  Dutch debt,  while  docking it of the  province of Luxem 
bourg,  and  adding to it  a Coburg dynasty.  But let us  come  to  the Turks  and 

30  Russians. 

One  of  those  facts  which  are  hardly  adverted  to  by  contemporaries,  but 
which  broadly  mark  the  boundaries  of  historical  epochs,  was  the  military 
occupation  of  Constantinople  by  the  Russians,  in  1833.  The  eternal  dream 
of  Russia  was  at  last fulfilled. The barbarian from the icy banks of the Neva 
35  held  in  his  iron  grasp,  however  temporarily,  the  luxurious  Byzantium  and 
the  sunlit shores  of the Bosphorus.  As  Sir Robert Peel declared in the House 
of  Commons  in  1834,  "The  occupation of Constantinople by Russian troops 
sealed the fate of Turkey as  an independent power. The fact of Russia having 
occupied  Constantinople  even  for  the purpose  of  saving it,  was  as  decisive 
a blow to  Turkish  independence,  as  if the flag of Russia now waved on the 
Seraglio."

In  consequence  of  the  unfortunate  war  of  1828-1829,  and  the  treaty  of 
Adrianople,  the  Porte  had  lost  its  prestige  in  the  eyes  of  its  own  subjects. 
As  usual with  Oriental  Empires  where  the  paramount  power  is  weakened, 
successive  revolts  of  powerful  Pashas  broke  out  against  the  Sultan,  and 
Mehemet  Ali,  Pasha  of  Egypt,  who  had  supported  the  Porte  during  the  Greek  5 
insurrection,  marched his  troops,  under the  command  of Ibrahim Pasha, his 
son,  into  Syria.  The  transactions  between  Mehemet  Ali  and  the  Sultan 
commenced as early as October, 1831. In the spring of 1832 Syria was invaded 
by  Ibrahim  Pasha;  in  July  the  battle  of  Horns  decided  the  fate  of  that 
Province; Ibrahim crossed the Taurus; the last Turkish army was annihilated  10 
at  Konieh,  in  December  21,  and  the  victorious  Egyptian  forces  moved  on 
the  way  to  Stambul.  On  February  2,  1833,  the  Sultan  was  forced  to  apply 
to  St. Petersburg for  succor.  On  February  17,  the  French  Admiral Roussin 
arrived at Constantinople, remonstrated with the Porte, and engaged to bring 
about a retreat of the Pasha on certain terms, including the refusal of Russian 
assistance;  but unassisted as he  was,  he  could not hope to vie with Russian 
influence.  "You have asked for me, and you shall have me."  On February 20, 
a  Russian  squadron  suddenly  sailed  from  Sebastopol,  and  disembarked  a 
large  body  of  Russian  troops  upon  the  shores  of the  Bosphorus, to  occupy 
the  capital.  So  eager was Russia for the protection of Turkey, that simulta-  20 
neously  a  Russian  officer  was  dispatched  to  the  Pashas  of  Erzerum  and 
Trebizond  to  inform  them  that  in  the  event  of  Ibrahim's  army  marching 
toward  Erzerum,  both  that  place  and  Trebizond  should  be  immediately 
protected  by  a  Russian  army.  Some  months  later  Count  Orloff  arrived, 
intimating  to  the  Sultan  that without the  concurrence  of  any  Minister  and  25 
without  the  knowledge  of  any  diplomatic  agent  at  the  Porte,  he  was  to 
subscribe  a  little  bit  of  paper  he  had brought with him from  St. Petersburg. 
Thus  originated  the  treaty  of  Unkiar  Skelessi.  According  to  it  the  Porte 
entered  for  eight  years  upon  an  alliance,  offensive  and  defensive,  with 
Russia;  precluded  itself  from  contracting  during that time  any  new treaties  30 
with  other powers  except with the  concurrence  of  the  Czar;  and  confirmed 
all her former treaties  with Russia. By a secret article, appended to the treaty, 
the  Porte  obliged  itself  "in  favor  of  the  Imperial  Court  of  Russia  to  close 
the straits of the Dardanelles and not to allow any foreign man-of-war to enter 
them  under  any pretext whatever." 

15 

35 

To whom was the Czar indebted first for materially holding Constantinople 
by  his  troops,  and  then  for  morally  transferring,  by  virtue  of  the  treaty  of 
Unkiar  Skelessi,  the  supreme  seat  of  government  from  Constantinople  to 
St. Petersburg?  To  nobody  else  than  the  Right  Hon.  Henry  John  Viscount 
Palmerston,  Baron  Temple,  a  Peer  of  Ireland,  a  member  of  Her  Majesty's  40 
most honorable Privy  Council, Knight of the Great Cross  of the most honor-

376 

Lord  Palmerston  ·  A  Chapter  of  Modern  History 

able  Order  of  the  Bath,  a  Member  of  Parliament,  and  then  the  principal 
Secretary  of  State  for  Foreign  Affairs. 

On July 8,1833, the  treaty of  Unkiar  Skelessi was  concluded. On July  11, 
1833,  Mr. H. L. Bulwer  was  curious  enough  to  ask  the  noble  lord  for  the 
5  production  of  papers  with  respect to  Turkish and  Syrian affairs.  The  noble 
lord  opposed  the  motion,  "because  the  transactions  to  which  the  papers 
called  for  referred,  were  incomplete,  and  the  character  of  the whole  trans 
action would depend upon its termination. As the results were not yet known, 
the  motion  was  premature." 

10 

15 

Being accused by Mr. Bulwer of having failed to defend the Sultan against 
Mehemet Ali,  and to prevent the advance of the Russian army, he began that 
curious  system  of  defense  and  of  confession,  developed  on later occasions, 
the  membra disjecta of which we now gather together for the first time. On 
July  11,1833,  he  said,  "he  was  not  prepared  to  deny  that  the  latter part of 
last  year  an  application  was  made  on  the  part  of the  Sultan to this country 
for assistance." This formal  application for  assistance  the Porte made at first 
in the  course  of August,  1832.  No,  not in August.  "The request of the Porte 
for  naval  assistance  was  made  in  the  month  of  October,  1832."  No,  it was 
not  in  October,  as  we  learn  from  a  speech  made  a  year  later.  "Assistance 
20  was asked by the Porte on November 3,1832." The noble lord is as uncertain 
as  to  the  date  when the  Porte  implored his  assistance  as  Falstaff  was  of the 
number  of  rogues  in  buckram  who  beset  him  and  whom  he  put  to  rout. 

He  is  not prepared,  however, to  deny that Russia having offered her armed 
assistance  to  the  Porte,  it  was  refused,  and  he  was  applied  to.  He  refused 
25  his  assistance.  However,  the  Porte  again  applied  to  the noble lord.  First, it 
sent  Mr. Maurojeni to  London, imploring his aid. Then it sent Namick Pasha 
to  entreat  the  assistance  of  a  naval  squadron,  undertaking to  defray all the 
expenses, and promising, in further requital for such succor, the grant of new 
commercial privileges  and  advantages to British subjects in Turkey.  So  sure 
30  was Russia of refusal on the part of the noble lord, that she joined the Turkish 
Envoy in praying for his lordship's assistance.  He tells us himself, in August, 
1833:  "It was  but justice  that he  should state, that  so far from Russia having 
expressed  any  jealousy  as  to  this  Government granting that assistance,  the 
Russian  Embassador  officially  communicated  to him,  while the request was 
still  under  consideration,  that  he  had  learned  that  such  an  application  had 
been  made,  and  that,  from  the  interest  taken by  Russia in the  maintenance 
and  preservation  of  the  Turkish  Empire,  it  would  afford  satisfaction  if 
Ministers  could  find  themselves  able  to  comply  with  that  request."  His 
lordship  remained  however  inexorable  to  the  demands  of  the  Porte,  even 
40  when backed by disinterested Russia herself. Then, of course, the Porte knew 
what  it  was  about,  and  comprehended  that  it  was  doomed  to  accept  the 

35 

377 

Karl  Marx 

Russian assistance.  "Great Britain,"  says the noble lord,  "never complained 
of Russia granting that assistance, but, on the contrary, was glad that Turkey 
had  been  able  to  obtain  effectual  relief  from  any  quarter." 

At  whatever  epoch  the  Porte  may  have  applied for  assistance  from  Lord 
Palmerston,  he  is  forced  to  own  that  "no  doubt  if  England  had  thought  fit 
to interfere, the progress of the  invading army would have been stopped, and 
the Russian troops would not have been called in." Why then did he not think 
fit  to  interfere,  and  to  avoid  having the  Russian  troops  called  in?  At first he 
pleads  want  of  time.  Having  himself  stated  that  the  conflict  between  the 
Sultan and Mehemet Ali arose  as early as October,  1831, while the battle of 
Konieh did not happen till December,  1832,  could he find no  time during all 
this  period? A great battle was  won by  ftrahim  in  1832,  and he  again found 
no  time  from July  to December.  But all this time he was waiting for a formal 
application  on  the  part  of  the  Porte  and,  according  to  his  last version,  that 
was not made until November 3. "Was he then," exclaimed Sir Robert Peel, 
"so  ignorant of what was passing in the  Levant that he must wait for a formal 
application?"  From  the  3d  of  Nov.  1832,  when  the  formal application  was 
made,  till  the  latter part of  February,  1833,  there  elapsed four long months, 
and  the  Russians  did  not  arrive  till  Feb. 20.  Why  did  he  not  arrive  before 
them?  But he  has  a better reason in  reserve. 

5 

10 

15 

20 

The  Pasha  of  Egypt  was  but  a  rebellious  subject.  The  Sultan  was  the 
sovereign.  The  observance  of  etiquette  did not allow the noble lord to inter 
meddle  between  them.  "As  it  was  a  war  against  a  sovereign  by  a  subject, 
and  that  sovereign  was  in  alliance  with the  King  of  England,  it would have 
been  inconsistent with  good  faith  to  have  had  any communication with the 
Pasha."  Like the Spanish grandee, the noble lord would rather let the Queen 
burn to  ashes  than  step  over  etiquette  and  interfere  with her petticoats.  But 
it  happens  that  the  noble  lord  had  already, in  1832,  accredited Consuls  and 
Diplomatic Agents to the Egyptian subject of the  Sultan without the consent 
of  the  Sultan;  that  he  had  entered  into  treaties  with  Mehemet  Ah  altering  30 
existing regulations and arrangements touching matters of trade and revenue ; 
that  he  did  not  ask  the  consent  of  the  Porte  beforehand,  nor  even  care  for 
its  approbation  afterward;  and  that  he  had  thus  treated  "the  rebellious 
subject"  as  an  independent  power.  Accordingly the  then chief  of  the  noble 
Viscount,  Earl  Grey  stated  in  the  House  of  Lords  that  "they  had  at  that  35 
moment  extensive  commercial  relations  with  Mehemet Ah,  which it would 
not  have  been  our  interest  to  disturb." 

25 

But  the  fleets  of  the  noble  Viscount were  occupied  in the  Douro  and  the 
Tagus,  and in blockading the  Scheldt,  and  doing the office of midwife at the 
birth  of  the  constitutional  empires  of  Portugal  and  Belgium,  and  he  was  40 
therefore  not in a  situation to  send a single man-of-war for such trifles as pre-

378 

Lord  Palmerston  · A  Chapter  of  Modern  History 

venting  Russia  from  occupying  Constantinople,  or  Mehemet  Ali  from  en 
dangering  the  status  quo  of  the  world;  and  what  the  Sultan  asked  for  was, 
unfortunately,  naval  assistance.  For  argument's  sake,  we will grant that he 
was  unable  to  dispose  of  one  single  vessel.  But  there  are  great  authorities 
5  asserting  that  not  even  a  single  vessel  was  wanted,  but  only  a  single  word 
on the  part  of  the  noble  lord,  in  order to check the ambition of Mehemet Ali 
and the armies of Ibrahim Pasha. Lord Mahon tells us this, and when he made 
his  statement  he  had  just  been  employed  at  the  Foreign  Office  under  Sir 
Robert  Peel.  Admiral  Codrington,  the  destroyer  of  the  Turkish  fleet  at 
10  Navarino, holds  similar language.  "Mehemet Ali," he states, "had of old felt 
the  strength  of  our  representation  on  the  subject  of  the  evacuation  of  the 
Morea.  He  had then received  orders  from the Porte to resist all applications 
to  induce  him  to  evacuate  it  at  the  risk  of  his  head,  and  he  did  resist  ac 
cordingly,  but  at last prudently yielded,  and evacuated the Morea."—Or take 
the testimony of  the Duke of Wellington:  "If, in the session of 1832 or  1833, 
they  had  plainly  told  Mehemet  Ali  that  he  should  not  carry  on  his  contest 
in  Syria  and  Asia Minor,  they would  have  put  an  end  to the war without the 
risk  of  allowing  the  Emperor  of  Russia  to  send  a  fleet  and  an  army  to 
Constantinople." 

15 

20 

But  there  are  still  better  authorities.  Hear  the  noble  lord  himself:  "Al 
though  His  Majesty's  Government  did  not  comply  with  the  demand  of  the 
Sultan  for  naval  assistance,  yet  the  moral  assistance  of  England  was  af 
forded;  and  the  communications  made  by  the  British  Government  to  the 
Pasha  of  Egypt  and  to  Ibrahim  Pasha,  commanding  in  Asia  Minor,  did 
25  materially contribute to bring about that arrangement (of Kutayah) between 
the  Sultan  and  the  Pasha,  by  which  the  war was  terminated."  Lord Derby, 
then  Lord  Stanley  and  a  Member  of  the  Palmerston  Cabinet,  also  "boldly 
asserts  that  what  stopped  the  progress  of  Mehemet  Ah  was  the  distinct 
declaration of  France and England that they would not permit the occupation 

30  of  Constantinople  by  his  troops." 

Thus,  according to Lord Palmerston liimself and to his  colleague—and this 
is the most curious feature of these curious transactions—it was by no means 
the  Russian  army  and  squadron,  but  a distinct  declaration on the part of the 
British  Consular  Agent  at  Alexandria,  that  stopped  Ibrahim  Pasha  in  his 
35  victorious march upon Constantinople  and brought about the convention of 
Kutayah,  according  to  which  Mehemet  Ah  obtained,  besides  Egypt,  the 
Pashalik of  Syria and that of Adana with other places added as an appendage. 
But the  noble  lord  thought fit  not to  allow  his  Consular  agent  at  Alexandria 
to  make  this  declaration  till  after  the  Turkish  army  was  annihilated,  Con-
stantinople occupied by Cossacks,  and the  treaty of Unkiar  Skelessi  signed 
by  the  Sultan  and  pocketed  by  the  Czar.

If  want of time  and  want  of fleets  prevented the noble lord from  assisting 
the  Sultan;  if  a  superfluity  of  etiquette  prevented  him  from  checking  the 
Pasha;  did  he  at  least  employ  his  Embassador  at  Constantinople  to  guard 
against  the  excessive  influence  of  Russia  and to  keep  her  interference  con 
fined  to  narrow  bounds?  Quite  the  contrary.  The  noble  Viscount,  in  order 
not  to  clog  the  movements  of  Russia,  took  good  care  that  there  should be 
no  Embassador  at  all  at Constantinople,  during the  most fatal  period  of  the 
crisis.  "If  ever  there  was  a  country,"  exclaims  Lord  Mahon,  "in which the 
weight  and  station  of  an  Embassador  was  useful,  or  a period  in which that 
weight  and  station  might  be  advantageously  exerted,  that  country  was  10 
Turkey,  during the  six months  before  the  8th of July,  1833."  Now the noble 
Viscount tells us  himself that  Sir  Stratford Canning, the British Embassador, 
left Constantinople in September,  1832, that Lord Ponsonby, then at Naples, 
was  appointed,  in  his  place,  in  November,  and  that  "difficulties  were  ex 
perienced  in  making  the  necessary  arrangements  for  his  conveyance,"  al-  15 
though  a  man-of-war  was  in  waiting for him,  "and the unfavorable  state of 
weather  did  prevent  him  getting  to  Constantinople  until  the  end  of  May, 
1833." 

Sir  Stratford  Canning  is  recalled  in  September  and  Lord  Ponsonby  ap 
pointed  in  November.  But  Ibrahim  Pasha had  not yet  crossed the  Taurus,  20 
not yet fought the battle of Konieh and the Russians  had not yet seized upon 
Czarigrad.  Accordingly  Lord Ponsonby is  ordered to  employ  seven  months 
in  sailing  from  Naples  to  Constantinople. 

But  why  should  Lord  Palmerston  prevent  the  Russians  from  occupying 
Constantinople?  "If  he had quietly beheld the temporary  occupation of the  25 
Turkish capital by the forces of Russia, it was because he had full confidence 
in the honor and good faith of Russia. The Russian Government, in granting 
aid  to  the  Sultan,  had  pledged  its  honor,  and  in that pledge,  he  reposed  the 
most  implicit  confidence."  With  the  same  confidence  he  had  relied  upon 
Russia not abolishing the Polish Constitution and Nationality. Meanwhile the  30 
Czar had abolished both by the Organic Statute of 1832—but the most implicit 
confidence of the noble lord remained unshaken. Not his is the fault, if nature 
has  developed his  protuberance of confidence to anomalous dimensions.  So 
inaccessible, 
in 
calculable, incommensurable, irremediable and unchangeable, so boundless,  35 
dauntless,  matchless,  is  his  confidence,  that  even  on  March  17,1834,  after 
the  treaty  of  Unkiar  Skelessi  had  become  a  fait accompli,  he goes  on  de 
claring  that  "in  their  confidence  Ministers  were  not  deceived."  Beside  the 
security  he  possessed in the  honor  and  good  faith  of Russia, he had another 
security  "in  the  doubt that any intention to partition that Empire  (the  Otto-  40 
man  Empire)  at  all  entered  into  the  policy  of  the  Russian  Government."

Lord  Palmerston  ·  A  Chapter  of  Modern  History 

Certainly,  Russia has  neyer  desired  to  partition that Empire, but to  keep the 
whole  of  it.  He  had  another  security  in  the  other  "doubt,  whether it enters 
into  the  policy  of  Russia  at  present  to  accomplish  the  object,"  and  a  third 
security  in  another  "doubt,  whether  the  Russian  nation  would be  prepared 
to  see that transference of power, of residence, and authority to the Southern 
Provinces,  which  would  be  the  necessary  consequence  of  the  conquest by 
Russia  of  Constantinople." 

The  contents  of  the  treaty  of  Unkiar  Skelessi  were published by the jour­
nals  of  London  on  August  21,  1833.  On  August  24,  Lord  Palmerston  was 
interrogated by Sir Robert Inglis, in the House of Commons,  "whether there 
had  really  been  concluded  a  treaty  offensive  and  defensive  between Russia 
and Turkey?"  Sir Robert Inglis  hoped  "that the noble lord would be prepared 
before  the  prorogation  of  Parliament  to  lay  before  the  House,  not  only  the 
treaty  that  had  been  made,  but  all  communications  connected  with  the 
formation  of  those  treaties  between  Turkey  and  Russia."  The  noble  lord 
answered  that  "when  they  were  sure  that  such  a  treaty  as  that  alluded  to 
really  did  exist,  and  when  they  were  in  possession  of  that  treaty,  it  would 
then  be  for  them  to  determine  what was  the  course  of policy  they ought to 
pursue,  and  it  could  be  no  blame  to  him,  when the  newspapers  were  some-
times  beforehand  with  the  Government."  Seven  months  afterwards,  he 
averred  that  "it  was  perfectly  impossible  that  the  treaty  of  Unkiar  Skelessi, 
which  was  not  ratified  at  Constantinople  until  the  month  of  September, 
should  have  been  officially  known  to  him  in  August." 

Now,  was  the  noble  lord  really  not  sure  in  August  that  such  a  treaty 
"really"  existed?  Was  he  at  that  time  not  yet  in  possession  of  that  treaty? 
At  a later  epoch,  in  March,  1848, he himself  stated that "the British Govern­
ment was  surprised to  find that when the Russian troops  quitted the Bospho­
rus they carried that treaty with them." This proved that he was in possession 
of  the  treaty  before  it  had  been  concluded.  " No  sooner,"  said  Mr. Anstey, 
in  a  speech  in  1848,  "had  the  Porte  received  it  than  the  treaty  was  com­
municated  by  them to  the  British  Embassy  at  Constantinople,  with a prayer 
for our protection  against  Ibrahim  Pasha  and against Nicholas. The applica­
tion  was rejected.  But that was  not all.  With an atrocious  perfidiousness,  the 
fact  was  made  known  to  the  Russian  Minister.  Next  day,  the  very  copy of 
the  treaty,  which  the  Porte  had  lodged  with  the  British  Embassy,  was  re­
turned  to  the  Porte  by the  Russian  Embassador, who  ironically  advised  the 
Porte  to  choose  better,  another  time,  its  confidants."

But  all  the  noble  Viscount  cared  for  he  had  obtained.  Having been inter­
rogated  with  respect  to  the  treaty  of  Unkiar  Skelessi,  on  August  24,  1833, 
40  Parliament  was  prorogued  on  August  29,  receiving  from  the  throne  the 
consolatory  assurance,  that  "the  hostilities  which  had  disturbed  the  peace 

381 

Karl  Marx 

of  Turkey,  had  been  terminated;  and  they might be  assured that the  King's 
attention  would  be  carefully  directed  to  any  events  which might  affect the 
present state or the future independence of that Empire." Here then we have 
the  key  to  the  mystery  of  the  famous Russian treaties  of July.  In July they 
are concluded ; in August something transpires about them through the public 5 
press ; Lord Palmerston is interrogated in the Commons ; he, of course, knows 
nothing  about them; Parliament is prorogued,  and, when it reassembles, the 
treaty  has  grown  old,  or,  as  in  the  instance  of  the  treaty  of  July,  1840,  the 
noble  lord  has  employed  the  interval  in  executing  it,  in  spite of Parliament 
and public  opinion. 

10 

On  August  29,  1833,  Parliament was  prorogued.  On February 5,  1834,  it 
reassembled,  but  the  interval  between  its  prorogation  and  its  meeting, was 
marked  by  two  incidents  mtimately connected  with each other.  On the  one 
hand,  the  united  French and English fleets had proceded to the Dardanelles, 
and  having  displayed  the  tricolor  and  the  union-jack,  both  sailed  away to  15 
Smyrna  and thence  to  Malta.  On the  other  hand,  on January 29,1834, a new 
treaty was  concluded between the Porte and Russia—the treaty of St. Peters 
burg.  Scarcely  had this  treaty  been signed,  when the united fleet was with 
drawn. 

This  combined  maneuver  was  intended  to  stultify the  British people  and  20 

Europe into the belief that the hostile demonstration on the Turkish seas and 
coasts,  directed  against the  Porte  for  having concluded  the treaty of Unkiar 
Skelessi, had induced Russia to replace it by the new treaty of St. Petersburg. 
This  treaty,  promising  the  evacuation of  the  Principahties with the exeption 
of  Silistria,  and  reducing  the  Turkish  payments  to  Russia  by  two-thirds,  25 
apparently  relieved  the  Porte  from  some  engagements  forced  on  it  by  the 
treaty  of  Adrianople.  In  all  other  respects  it was  a  simple ratification  of the 
treaty of Adrianople,  not at  all relating to  the  treaty of  Unkiar  Skelessi, nor 
dropping a single word about the passage of the Dardanelles. On the contrary, 
the  small  alleviations  it  granted  to  Turkey were  the  bribe  paid  for  the  ex-  30 
elusion  of  Europe  obtained  by  the  treaty  of  Unkiar  Skelessi  in  favor  of 
Russia.  Let  us  hear  Mr.Anstey  on  this  head:  "At  the  very  day  that  the 
demonstration  of  the  British  fleet  was being  made,  an assurance  was given 
by the noble lord to the Russian Embassador at this Court, that this combined 
movement of the  combined squadrons was not intended in any sense hostile  35 
to  Russia,  nor  to  be  taken  as  a  hostile  demonstration  against  her,  but that, 
in fact,  it meant nothing  at all.  I  say this on the authority of Lord Ponsonby, 
the  noble  lord's  own  colleague,  the  Embassador  at  Constantinople." 

Parliament having reassembled, there appeared in  The London Globe, the 
organ of the Foreign Office, a paragraph announcing the treaty of St. Peters-  40 
burg  as  "a  proof  either  of  the  moderation  or  good  sense  of  Russia,  or  of  the 

382 

Lord  Palmerston  ·  A  Chapter  of  Modern  History 

influence which the union of England and France, and the firm and concerted 
language of those two  countries,  have  acquired in the councils of St. Peters 
burg."  Thus  public  attention  was  to  be  diverted  from  the  treaty  of  Unkiar 
Skelessi,  and  the  animosity  soothed  down which  it  had  aroused  in  Europe 
against Russia. 

5 

10 

15 

Artful  as  this  dodge  was,  it would  not do.  On  March  17,  1834,  Mr. Sheil 
brought in  a  motion  for  "copies  of the  treaties  between Turkey  and  Russia, 
and  of  any  correspondence  between  the  English,  Russian,  and  Turkish 
Governments, respecting those treaties." The noble lord resisted this motion 
to  the  utmost.  So  grossly  contradictory were  his  reasons  for  not  indulging 
the  request of  Mr. Sheil, that Sir Robert Peel, in his Parliamentary language, 
could  not  but  call  him  "a  very  unconclusive  reasoner,"  and  that  the  noble 
lord's  own  Colonel  Evans  could  not  avoid  exclaiming  that:  "the  speech of 
the  noble  lord  appeared  to  him  the  most  unsatisfactory  he  had  ever  heard 
from him." When the production of papers was first demanded,  on July  11, 
1833,  the  motion was  "premature,"  because  the  «transactions  were incom 
plete,"  and  "the  result  not  yet  known."  When  the  noble  lord  was  again 
interrogated,  on  August  24,1833,  "the  treaty was  not officially  signed,  and 
he was  not in possession  of it."  Now,  on  March  17,1834, "communications 
20  were  still carrying on—the discussions, if he might so call them, were not yet 
completed."  He  enjoined the  House  not to  press  upon him, as  "peace could 
be  preserved  only  by  the  House  reposing  confidence  in  the  Government," 
which,  if  let  alone,  would  certainly  protect  the  interests  of  England  from 
encroachment.  Three  years  later,  in a thin House, composed almost entirely 
25  of  his  retainers,  he  came  roundly  out  and  told  Mr. Thomas  Attwood  very 
coolly  that  "the  treaty  of  Unkiar  Skelessi was  a matter which had gone by," 
and that it had never been "the intention of the Government to have recourse 
to  hostile measures to compel Russia and Turkey—two independent powers— 
to  cancel  the  treaty  made  between  them." 

30 

The  noble  lord,  so  far  from  endeavoring  to  refute  Mr. Shell's  statement, 
that  "the  consequence  of  the  treaty  of  Unkiar  Skelessi  was  the  same  as  if 
the  Porte  surrendered  to  Russia  the  possession  of  the  Dardanelles,"  was 
obliged  to  own that it closed the Dardanelles to British men-of-war, and that 
"he  did  not  mean  to  say,  that  under  its  provisions  even merchant  vessels 
35  might not, in effect, be practically excluded from the Black Sea," in the case 
of  a war of  England with Russia. But if the Government acted "with temper," 
if it  "showed no unnecessary  distrust,"  that is,  if it  submitted quietly to the 
encroachments  of  Russia,  he was  "inclined  to  think that the  case might not 
arise  in  which that  treaty  would be  called into  operation,  and  that therefore 
it  would,  in  practice,  remain  a  dead  letter."  And  besides,  "the  assurances 
and  explanations  which  the  British  Government  had  received  from  the 

40 

383 

Karl  Marx 

contracting  parties  to  that  treaty,  greatly  tended  to  remove  his  objections 
to  it."  In  order  to  mystify the  House,  he  dropped  some  words  to  the  effect, 
according  to  the  language  held  by  Russia,  the  treaty  must be  looked  upon 
"as  one  of  reciprocity,  that reciprocity  being,  that if the Dardanelles  should 
be  closed  against England in the  event of war, they should be closed against 
Russia also." This  statement was  simply false, but if true, "this certainly was 
Irish  reciprocity,  for  it  was  all  on  one  side." 

5 

Thus  then,  it was  not the  articles  of  the  treaty of  Unkiar Skelessi, but the 
assurances  Russia  gave with respect to  them;  it was  not the  acts  of Russia, 
he  had,  in his  opinion, to look upon, but rather the language  she thought fit  10 
to hold. Yet, when on the same day the attention of the noble lord was called 
to  the  protest of  the  French  Chargé  d'Affaires,  M. de  Lagrené,  against the 
treaty  of  Unkiar  Skelessi,  and  the  offensive  and  contumelious  language  of 
Count  Nessehode,  answering  him  that the Emperor of Russia would act "as 
if the  declaration contained in the note  of M. de Lagrené had no existence,"  15 
then the noble lord, eating his own words, propounded the opposite doctrine, 
that  it  "was  on  all  occasions,  the  duty  of  the  English  Government  to  look 
rather  to  the  acts  of  a foreign power,  than to  the language which that power 
might hold on any  particular  subject or occasion." At one moment he appeals 
from  the  acts  of Russia to  her language,  and the  other from  her language  to  20 
her  acts.  Fourteen  years  afterward,  when the  treaty  of  Unkiar  Skelessi had 
long  elapsed  and  the  noble  lord  was  just  about acting  the  play  of  the  Truly 
English  Minister and  the  Civis  Romanus  sum, he told Parliament plainly that: 
"The  treaty of  Unkiar Skelessi was, no doubt, to a certain degree forced upon 
Turkey by Count Orloff, the Russian Envoy, under circumstances"—created  25 
by  the  noble  lord  himself—"which rendered  it  difficult  for  Turkey  to  refuse 
acceding  to  it—that  it  gave  practically  to  the  Russian  Government  a power 
of interference  and  dictation in Turkey not consistent with the independence 
of  that  State."  The  great  triumphant  argument  which,  during  the  whole 
transactions  with respect to the treaty of Unkiar Skelessi, the noble lord had  30 
ready  to  oppose  to  all the attacks upon his connivance with Russia, was that 
of  his  intimate  alliance  with  France.  Like  the  clown in the  comedy,  he  had 
an  answer  of  monstrous  size,  that  must  meet  all  demands  and  serve  all 
questions, namely:  The Anglo-French Alliance.  When he was pointed at with 
sneers  because  he  had  allowed the  Russian  occupation  of  Constantinople,  35 
he  retorted  that,  "if  the  present  relations  established  between  this  country 
and France were pointed at in these  sneers, he would only say, that he should 
look with feelings of pride and satisfaction at the part he had acted in bringing 
about  that good  understanding."  When the production of the papers relating 
to  the  treaty of  Unkiar  Skelessi was demanded, he answered, that "England  40 
and France had now cemented a friendship, which had only grown stronger." 

384 

Lord  Palmerston  -  A Chapter of  Modern  History 

But  Sir  Robert Peel  exclaimed  that  "he  could  but remark that whenever the 
noble lord was thrown into a difficulty, as to any part of our foreign European 
policy,  he at once found a ready means of escape by congratulating the House 
upon  the  close  alliance  of  this  country  with  France."  At the  same time the 
noble lord took good care not to quench the suspicions of his Tory opponents, 
that  he  had  been  compelled  to  connive  at  an  aggression  upon  Turkey  by 
Mehemet  Ah,  because  France  had  directly  encouraged  it. 

5 

Thus  at that time  the  apparent alliance with France  was  to  cover  a  secret 
infeoffment  to  Russia,  just  as  in  1840,  the  artificially  managed  rupture  with 

10  France  was  to  sanction  an official  alliance  with Russia. 

While  the  noble  lord  fatigued  the  world by publishing ponderous folios of 
fruitless  negotiations  on the  affairs  of the  Constitutional Empire of Belgium, 
and  with  ample  explanations,  verbal,  and  documentary,  with  regard  to  the 
substantive power of Portugal, to this moment it has proved quite impossible 
to  wrest  from  him  any  document whatever  relating  to  the  first  Syriac  and 
Turkish  war  and  to  the  treaty  of  Unkiar  Skelessi.  Even in  1848  he resisted 
the  production  of  those  papers,  although  Mr. Anstey  stated  plainly  that,  in 
asking  for  them,  he  did  so  with the view to  prove the  noble  lord's  collusion 
with  the  Czar.  The  noble lord preferred  killing time  by a five  hours'  speech 
to  killing  suspicion by  setf-speaking  documents. 

His  system of fictions, pretexts, contradictions, traps and incredible state 
ments  reached  its  climax,  when,  on  December  14,  1837,  he  objected  to  a 
resolution of Mr. T. Attwood for the production of the papers connected with 
the treaty of Unkiar Skelessi, on the ground that "the papers connected with 
that  treaty  were  laid  before  the  House  three  years  ago,"  viz.,  in  1834,  and 
that "it was a treaty entered into for a hmited period," and "that period having 
expired,  its  introduction by  the  honorable  member was  wholly unnecessary 
and  uncalled  for."  The  noble  Viscount  knew  as  well  that the  papers  were 
not laid  before  the  House  in  1834,  or  at any other period,  as  that the treaty 
of Unkiar Skelessi,  far from having expired on December 14,1837, continued 

15 

20 

25 

30 

to  remain  in full  vigor  tul  July  8,  1841. 

Such a gross  system  of fraud formed the last refuge of an English Minister, 
who  had  opened  Constantinople  to  a  Russian  army,  and  closed the  Darda 
nelles  to  the  English  navy,  and  who  had  helped  the  Czar  to  get possession 
35  of  Constantinople  for  months  and  the  control  of  Turkey  for  years.  How 
absurd then to  suppose that he is  now likely to turn about and oppose afriend 
he  has  so  long  and  so  faithfully  served.

Lord  Palmerston's  resignation  seems  to  be  working  in  England  all  the 
marvels  he  could  have  hoped  from  it.  While  the  public  indignation  is  be 
coming  more  and  more  active  against  the  Cabinet  he  has  abandoned,  and 
whose policy he had on all occasions, up to the last moment of his connection 
with  them,  emphatically  endorsed,  the  very  parties  loudest  in  their  de 
nunciations  of the Coalition, vie  with each other in the praise of Palmerston. 
And  while  they  call  for  energetic  and  honorable  resistance  to  the  en 
croachments of Russia, on the one hand, they seem to desire nothing so much 
as the restoration of their favorite  statesman to high office on the other. Thus 
this  accomplished  and  relentless  actor  deludes  the  world.  It  would  be  an 
amusing  spectacle  were  the  interests  involved  less  momentous.  How  deep 
is  the  delusion  we  have  already  had  occasion  to  show,  and  now  add below 
a  new  demonstration  of  the  truth  that,  for  some  reason  or  other,  Lord 
Palmerston has steadily labored for the advancement of Russia, and has used 
England  for  that  purpose.  Those  who  seek  to  look  behind  the  scenes  of 
current history and to judge events and men at their real value will, we think, 
find  our  exposure  instructive.

One  glance  over  the  map  of  Europe  will  show  us  on  the western  side  of 
the  Black  Sea the  outlets of the  Danube, the only river which  springs  up in  20 
the very heart of Europe, and may be  said to form  a natural highway to Asia. 
Exactly opposite,  on the  eastern  side  of the Euxine,  southwards of the river 
Kuban,  begins  the  mountainous  range  of  the  Caucasus,  which,  stretching 
from  the  Black  Sea  to  the  Caspian  in  a  south-easterly  direction  for  some 
700 miles,  separates  Europe  from  Asia. 

25 

The  power  which  holds  the  outlets  of  the  Danube  necessarily  holds  the 
Danube  also,  the  highway  to  Asia,  and  with  it  controls  a great  deal  of  the 
commerce  of  Switzerland,  Germany,  Hungary,  Turkey,  and  above  all  of 
Moldavia and Wallachia.  But give the  same power the Caucasus in addition, 
and the Black Sea will exclusively belong to it as a mare clausum, and only  30 
Constantinople  and  the  Dardanelles  are  wanted  in  order  to  shut  its  door. 
The  possession  of  the  Caucasian  mountains  insures  at  once  the  control  of 
Trebizond,  and  through  its  position  with  reference  to  the  Caspian  Sea,  of 
the  northern  seaboard  of  Persia. 

The  greedy eye  of Russia has  embraced at once the outlets of the Danube  35 

and the  mountainous  range of the Caucasus. There the business in hand was 
to  conquer  supremacy;  here,  to  maintain  it.  The  chains  of  the  Caucasus 
mountains  separate  Southern  Russia from  the  luxurious  provinces  of Geor-

386

gia,  Mingrelia,  Imeritia  and  Guriel,  which  the  Muscovite  had wrested from 
the  Mussulman.  Thus  the foot of the monster empire is cut off from its  main 
body. The only military road winds from Mozdok to Tif lis through the narrow 
pass  of  Dariel,  secured  by  a  continuous  chain  of  intrenched  places,  and 
exposed  on  both  sides  to  eternal  attacks from  the  hostile  Caucasian tribes. 
The  union  of  the  Caucasian  tribes  under  one  military  chief  might  even 
endanger  the  bordering country of the  Cossacks.  "The thought of the dread 
ful  consequences  which  a  union  of  the  hostile  Caucasians  under  one  head 
would  produce  in  the  south  of  Russia  fills  one  with  terror,"  exlaims 
10  Mr. Kupffer,  a German who  presided  over the  scientific commission which 

in  1829  accompanied  the  expedition  of  Gen. Emmanuel  to  Elbruz. 

At  this  very  moment  our  attention  is  directed  with  equal  anxiety  to  the 
banks  of the Danube,  where  Russia has  seized the two granaries of Europe, 
and  to  the  Caucasus,  where  she  is  menaced  with  expulsion  from  Georgia. 
15  Her  movements  in both  these  regions have  a common origin.  It was  by the 
treaty  of  Adrianople  that the  usurpation  of  Moldo-Wallachia was  prepared, 
and  that  were  founded  her  claims  on  the  Caucasus. 

Art. IV  of  that  treaty  has  the  following  stipulation: 
"All  the  countries  situated to the north and east of the line of demarcation 
20  between the two empires (Russia and Turkey) toward Georgia, Imeritia and 
Guriel, as well as all the  shore of the Black Sea, from the mouth of the Kuban 
as  far  as  the  port  of St. Nicholas inclusively,  shall remain under the domina 
tion  of  Russia." 

25 

30 

With regard  to  the  Danube  the  same  treaty  stipulates: 
"The  frontier  line  will  follow  the  course  of  the  Danube  to  the  mouth  of 
St. George,  leaving  all  the  islands  formed  by  the  different  branches  in  the 
possession of  Russia.  The  right bank will remain, as formerly, in the posses 
sion of the  Ottoman Porte.  It is,  however,  agreed,  that that right bank, from 
the  point  where  the  arm  of  St.  George  departs  from  that  of  Sulina,  shall 
remain  uninhabited to  a  distance  of  two  hours  (six  miles)  from  the  river, 
and  that  no  kind  of  structure  shall  be  raised  there;  and  in  like  manner on 
the  islands  which  still  remain  in  the  possession  of  Russia.  With  the  ex 
ception  of  quarantines  which  will  be  there  established,  it  will  not  be  per 
mitted  to  make  any  other  establishment  or  fortification." 

35 

Both these  paragraphs,  inasmuch  as  they  secured  to  Russia new posses 
sions  and  exclusive  commercial  advantages,  infringe  on  the  protocol  of 
April 4,1826,  drawn up  by the Duke of Wellington at St. Petersburg, and the 
treaty  of  July  6,  1827,  concluded  between  Russia  and  the  other  powers  at 
London. The  English Government, therefore, refused to recognize the treaty 
40  of Adrianople.  The Duke of Wellington protested against it. Lord Aberdeen 
protested against it as Lord Mahon says :  "In a dispatch to Lord Heytesbury, 

387 

Karl  Marx 

dated  31st  October,  1829,  he  commented  with  no  small  dissatisfaction  on 
many  parts  of  the  treaty  of  Adrianople,  and  especially  noticed  the  stipula 
tions  respecting  the  islands  of  the  Danube.  He  denies  that  that  treaty  has 
respected  the  territorial rights  of  sovereignty  of  the  Porte  and the condition 
and the interests of all maritime States in the Mediterranean." Earl Grey said: 
"That  the  independence  of  the  Porte  would  be  sacrificed  and  the peace  of 
Europe  endangered  by  this  being  agreed  to."  Lord  Palmerston  himself,  in 
his  speech  of  March  17,  1837,  informs  us:  "As  far  as  the  extension of  the 
Russian frontier  is  concerned  on the  mouth  of  the  Danube,  the  south  of the 
Caucasus  and  the  shores of the Black Sea, it is certainly not consistent with  10 
the  solemn  declaration  made  by  Russia  in  the  face  of  Europe  previous  to 
the  commencement  of  the  Turkish  war." 

5 

The  eastern  shores  of  the  Black  Sea, by blockading of which and  cutting 
off  the  supply  of  arms  and gunpowder  to  the  north-western  Circassian  dis 
tricts, Russia could  alone hope  to realize  her claim on the Caucasus she had  15 
wrested from  Turkey—the  shore  of  the  Black  Sea,  as  well as the  outlets  of 
the  Danube,  are certainly no places  "where  an English action could possibly 
take  place,"  as  was lamented by Lord Palmerston in the case of Cracow.  By 
what mysterious  contrivance then has the Muscovite, nevertheless, succeed 
ed in blocking up the Danube, in blockading the  shore of the Euxine and in  20 
forcing  England  to  submit  not  only  to  the  treaty  of  Adrianople,  but  at  the 
same  time  to  the  violations  by  Russia  herself  of  that  identical  treaty? 

These questions were put to the noble Viscount in the  House of Commons 
on  April  20,  1836.  Petitions  were  simultaneously  presented  from  the  mer 
chants  of  London,  of  Glasgow,  and  other  commercial  towns,  against  the  25 
fiscal regulations of Russia on the Black Sea, and her enactments and restric 
tions,  intended  to  interrupt  English  commerce  on  the  Danube. 

There  had  appeared  on  February 7,1836, an ukase which, by virtue of the 
treaty  of  Adrianople,  established  a  quarantine  on  one  of the  islands  formed 
by the mouths of the Danube. In order to execute the quarantine regulations,  30 
Russia  claimed  a  right  of  boarding  and  search,  of  levying  fees  and  seizing 
and  marching  off  to  Odessa  refractory  sailors,  proceeding  on  their  voyage 
up  the  Danube.  Before  the  quarantine  was  established,  or  rather  before, 
under  the  false  pretense  of  a  quarantine,  a  fort  and  a  custom-house  were 
erected, the Russian authorities had thrown out feelers to ascertain what risk  35 
they  would  run  with  the  British  Government.  Lord  Durham,  acting  upon 
instructions  received from  England,  remonstrated with the Russian  Govern 
ment  for  these  hinderances  to  British  trade.  He  was  referred  to  Count 
Nessehode.  Count Nessehode referred to the Governor of South Russia, and 
the  Governor  of  South  Russia  again  referred  to  the  Consul  at  Galatz, who  40 
communicated with the British Consul at Ibraila, who was instructed to send 

388 

Lord  Palmerston  ·  England  and  Russia 

down  the  captains  from  whom  toll  had  been  exacted,  to  the  mouth  of  the 
Danube,  the  scene  of their  injuries,  in  order that inquiry might be made into 
the  subject,  it  being  well  known  that  the  captains  referred  to  were  then 
in  England. 

5 

The formal ukase of Feb. 7,1836, aroused, however, the general attention 
of British  merchants,  since, as  Mr. Stewart stated in the House of Commons 
on April 20,1836,  "many ships had sailed and others were going out, to whose 
captains  strict  orders  had  been  given  not to  submit to  the  right  of boarding 
and  search which Russia claimed.  The fate of these  ships must be inevitable, 
10 unless some expression of opinion was made on the part of the House. Unless 
that  were  done,  British  shipping  to  the  amount  of  not  less  than  5,000  tons 
would  be  seized  and  marched  off  to  Odessa,  until  the  insolent  commands 
of  Russia  were  complied  with." 

We  have  stated  that Russia  acquired the  marshy islands  at the  mouths  of 
15 the Danube, in virtue of the treaty of Adrianople, which treaty was a violation 
of  that  which  she  had  previously  concluded  with  England  and  the  other 
powers  on July 26,  1827.  Her bristling the  mouths  of the  Danube with forti 
fications, and these fortifications with guns, was  also a violation of the treaty 
of  Adrianople,  which  expressly  prohibited  any  fortifications  to  be  erected 
20  within  six miles of the river. The exacting of tolls and the obstruction of the 
navigation  was  a violation  of  the  treaty  of  Vienna,  which declared that "the 
navigation of rivers  along their whole  course, from  the point where  each of 
them became navigable to its mouth,  shall be entirely free," that "the amount 
of  the  duties  shall,  in  no  case,  exceed  those  now  (in  1815)  paid,"  and  that 
"no increase  shall take place except with the common consent of the States 
bordering  on their  river."  Thus  then,  the  only points  on which Russia could 
plead  not  guilty,  was  an  infraction  of  the  treaty  of  1827,  by  the  treaty  of 
Adrianople,  an open violation  by  herself  of  the treaty of Adrianople, and an 
insolent  rupture  of  the  treaty  of  Vienna. 

25 

30 

It appeared quite impossible to wring out of Lord Palmerston any declara 
tion whether he  did or  did not recognize the treaty  of  Adrianople.  As  to the 
treaty of Vienna,  "he had received no  official information that any thing had 
occurred which is  not warranted by the treaty. When such a statement should 
be  made  by  the  parties  concerned,  it  should  be  dealt with  in  such  manner 
35  as  the  law  advisers  of the  Crown  should deem consistent with the  rights  of 

the  subjects  of  England." 

By Art. V.  of the  treaty of Adrianople, Russia  "guarantees  the prosperity 
of  the  Danubian  Principalities  and  full  liberty  of  trade  for  them."  Now, 
Mr. Patrick Stewart proved that the Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia 
40  were  objects  of deadly  jealousy to  Russia, as their trade had taken a sudden 
development  since  1834,  as  they  vied with Russia's  own  staple production, 

389 

Karl  Marx 

as  Galatz  was  becoming  the  great  dépôt  of  all  the grain of the  Danube  and 
driving Odessa out of the market.  To this Lord Palmerston answered in these 
words: 

"If  my  honorable  friend  had  been able  to  show,  that whereas  some  years 
ago  we had had  a large  and important commerce  with Turkey,  and that that 
commerce  had  by  the  aggression of  other  countries, or by the neglect of the 
government  of  this,  dwindled  down  to  an  inconsiderable  trade,  then  there 
might  have  been  ground  to  call  upon  Parliament.  In  lieu  of  such  an  oc 
currence,  my  honorable  friend has  shown that  during the  last few  years  the 
trade  with  Turkey  has  risen  from  next  to  nothing  to  a  very  considerable  10 
amount." 

5 

"Russia obstructs  the  Danube  navigation,  because the trade of the Princi 
palities is growing important,"  says Mr. Stewart. "But she did not do so when 
that trade was  next to  nothing,"  answers  Lord Palmerston.  "You neglect to 
oppose  Russia's  recent  encroachment  on  the  Danube,"  says  Mr. Stewart.  15 
"But  did we  do  so  before  these  encroachments  were  ventured upon?"  asks 
Lord  Palmerston.  His  Lordship  succeeded  in  preventing  the  House  from 
coming  to  a  resolution  by  assuring  it  that  "there was  no  disposition of  Her 
Majesty's  Government  to  submit  to  aggressions  on  the  part  of  any  power, 
be  that power what  it may,  and  be  it more  or less  strong," and by warning  20 
the  House  that  "they  should  also  cautiously  abstain  from  anything  which 
might  be  construed  by  other powers, and reasonably so, as being a provoca 
tion  on  their  part." 

A  week  after  these  debates  had  taken place  in the  House  of Commons  a 
British  merchant  addressed  a  letter  to  Lord  Palmerston  with  regard  to  the  25 
Russian  ukase.  He  was  answered  by  the  Under-Secretary  at  the  Foreign 
Office  as  follows: 

"I  am  directed  by  Viscount  Palmerston  to  acquaint you that  his  lordship 
has  called  upon  the  law  adviser  for  the  crown  for  his  opinion  as  to  the 
regulations  promulgated  by  the  Russian  ukase  on  Feb. 7,  1836;  but,  in the  30 
meantime,  Lord  Palmerston  directs  me to  acquaint you,  with  respect to  the 
latter  part of  your letter,  that  it is  the  opinion of His Majesty's Government 
that  no  toll  is  justly  demanded  by  the  Russian  authorities  at  the  mouth  of 
the  Danube,  and you have  acted properly  in directing your  agents  to  refuse 
to  pay it." 

35 

The  merchant on  acting according to  this  letter was  abandoned  to  Russia 
by  the  noble  lord;  a  Russian  toll,  as  Mr. Urquhart  states,  is  now  exacted  in 
London  and  Liverpool by  Russian Consuls on every English ship  sailing for 
the Turkish ports of the Danube, and the quarantine  still  stands on the island 
of  Leti. 

40 

But Russia  did  not limit  her  invasion of the Danube to a quarantine estab-

390 

Lord  Palmerston  •  England  and  Russia 

lished,  to  fortifications  erected,  and to  tolls  exacted.  The  only  mouth  of the 
Danube  still navigable, the  Sulina mouth, came into the possession of Russia 
through the treaty  of  Adrianople.  As long as it was  possessed by the Turks, 
a  depth  of  water  was  kept in  the  channel of from  14  to  16 feet.  Since  it has 
5  been  possessed by Russia,  the  water has become  reduced to  8  feet,  a depth 
wholly  inadequate  to  the  conveyance  of vessels employed in the corn trade. 
Now  Russia is  a  party  to  the  treaty  of  Vienna,  and that treaty  stipulates in 
article  113,  that "each State shall be at the expense of keeping in good repair 
the  towing  paths,  and  shall  maintain  the  necessary  works  in  order  that  no 
10  obstruction  shall be experienced by  the  navigation." Russia found no better 
means for keeping the channel in a navigable  state than choking up its mouth 
with  an  accumulation of  sand  and  mud,  and  paving its  bar  with shipwrecks. 
To  this  systematic  and  protracted  violation  of the  treaty  of Vienna,  Russia 
has  added  another  violation  of  the  treaty  of  Adrianople,  which forbids  the 
erecting of any establishment at the  mouth of the Sulina, except for quaran 
tine  and  light-house  purposes,  since,  at  her  dictation,  there  has  sprung  up 
there  a  small  Russian  town,  supported  by  the  extortions,  the  occasion  for 
which  has  been  afforded  by  the  delays  and  expenses  for  lighterage  con 
sequent  upon  the  obstruction  of  the  channel. 

15 

20 

"Of what u s e" said Lord Palmerston, on April 30,1823, "is it to dwell upon 
abstract principles  with despotic governments who are accused of measuring 
right  by  power,  and  of  ruling  their  conduct  by  expediency,  and  not by jus 
tice?" According to his own maxim the noble  Lord took good care to content 
himself with dwelling upon abstract principles with the  despotic government 
25  of Russia.  But he went further.  While he assured the House on July 6,1840, 
that  the  freedom  of  the  Danube  was  "guaranteed  by  the  treaty  of  Vienna;" 
and  while  he  lamented  on  July  13,  1840,  that,  although  the  occupation  of 
Cracow  was  a  violation  of  the  treaty  of  Vienna,  "there  were  no  means  of 
enforcing  the  opinion  of  England  because  Cracow  was  evidently  a  place 

35 

30  where  no  English  action  could possibly take place," he  two days later con 
cluded  a treaty  with  Russia,  by  virtue  of which treaty, the Dardanelles were 
hermetically  closed  to  English  men-of-war  during  peace  with  Turkey,  thus 
bereaving  England  of  the  only  means  of  enforcing the treaty  of Vienna, and 
transforming  the  Euxine  into  "a  place,  where  no  English action could pos-
sibly  take  place."  This  point  once  obtained,  he  gave  a sham  satisfaction to 
public opinion by firing off a whole battery of papers reminding "the despotic 
government"  which  "measures  right  by  power,  and  rules  its  conduct  by 
expediency,  and  not  by  justice,"  in  a  very  sententious  and  sentimental 
manner,  that  "Russia,  when  she  compelled  Turkey  to  cede to  her the  outlet 
40  of  a  great  European  river  which  forms  the  commercial  highway  for  the 
mutual  intercourse  of  many  nations,  undertook  duties  and  responsibilities 

391 

Karl  Marx 

to  other  states,  which  she  should  take  a pride  in  making  good."  To  such  a 
homily  upon  abstract  principles,  Count  Nessehode  answered  steadily  and 
flegmatically  that  "the  subject  should be carefully examined," and from time 
to  time  he  expressed  "a  feeling  of  soreness  on  the  part  of  the  Imperial 
Government  at the  mistrust manifested  as  to  their  intentions." 

5 

Thus,  through  the  management  of  the noble  Lord,  things  have  arrived  in 
1853  at  the  point  where  the  navigation  of  the  Danube  had  been  declared 
impossible,  and  wheat  is  rotting  at  the  mouth  of  the  Sulina,  while  famine 
threatens to  invade  France,  England  and the  South of Europe.  Thus  Russia 
has  added,  as  The  Times  said,  "to  her  other important possessions,  that of  10 
an hon gate  between the Danube and the Euxine."  She has acquired the key 
of  the  Danube  and  of  a  bread-screw  which  she  can  put  on,  whenever  the 
policy  of  Western  Europe  becomes  obnoxious  to  punishment. 

The  mystery,  however,  of  Lord  Palmerston's  transactions  with Russia  as 
to her  schemes  on the  Danube was  not revealed till during the course of the  15 
debates  on  Circassia.  Then  it  was  proved  by  Mr. Anstey  on  February  23, 
1848,  that  "the  noble  Viscount's  first  act  on  coming  into  office  (as  the 
Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs)  was  to  accept  the  treaty  of  Adrianople,"—the 
same  treaty  against  which  the  Duke  of  Wellington  and  Lord  Aberdeen had 
protested. 

20 

How  this  was  done  and  how  Circassia was  delivered  by Lord Palmerston 
to  Russia,  as  far  as  he  had  the  power  to  deliver  it,  may  perhaps,  form  the 
subject  of  another  article.

Ruggiero  is  again  and  again fascinated by the false charms of Alcine, which, 
he  knows  to  disguise  an  old  witch— 

Sans  teeth,  sans  eyes,  sans  taste,  sans  everything, 
and  the  knight-errant  cannot  withstand  falling in love  with her  anew whom 
he  knows  to  have  transmuted  all  her  former  adorers  into  asses  and  other 
beasts.  The  English  public  is  another  Ruggiero,  and  Palmerston  is  another 
Alcine.  Although  a  septuagenarian,  and  since  1807  occupying  the  public 
stage,  almost without interruption,  he  contrives  to remain a novelty, and to 
evoke  all  the  hopes  that  used  to  centre  on an untried  and promising youth. 
With  one  foot  in  the  grave,  he  is  supposed  not  yet  to  have  begun  his  true 
career.  If  he  were to die to-morrow,  all England would be  surprised at learn 
ing  that  he  has  been  a  Secretary  of  State  half  this  century. 

If not a good  statesman of all work, he is at least a good actor of all work. 
He  succeeds  in the  comic  as  in the  heroic—in pathos  as in familiarity—in the 
tragedy  as  in  the  farce;  although  the  latter  may  be  more  congenial  to  his 
feelings.  He  is  no  first  class  orator,  but  he  is  an  accomplished  debater. 
Possessed  of  a  wonderful  memory,  of  great  experience,  of  a  consummate 
tact,  of  a never-failing présence  d'esprit,  of a gentlemanlike versatility, of 
the  most  minute  knowledge  of  parliamentary  tricks,  intrigues,  parties,  and 
men,  he  handles  difficult  cases  in  an  admirable  manner  and  with a pleasant 
volubility, sticking to the prejudices and susceptibilities of his public, secured 
from  any  surprise  by  his  cynic  impudence,  from  any  self-confession by  his 
selfish  dexterity,  from  running  into  a passion by his  profound frivolity,  his 
perfect  indifference,  and  his  aristocratic  contempt.  Being  an  exceedingly 
happy joker, he ingratiates  himself with everybody. Never losing his temper, 
he  imposes  on  an  impassioned  antagonist.  When unable to  master a subject, 

393 

Karl  Marx 

he knows how to play with it.  If wanting of general views, he is always ready 
to  tissue  elegant  generalities. 

Endowed with  a restless  and indefatigable  spirit, he abhors inactivity,  and 
pines  for  agitation,  if  not  for  action.  A country like  England allows  him,  of 
course,  to  busy himself  in every corner of the  earth.  What he  aims  at is  not 
the  substance,  but  the  mere  appearance  of  success. 

5 

If he can do nothing, he will devise anything. Where he dares not interfere, 
he intermeddles.  Not  able to vie  with a  strong enemy, he improvises a weak 
one. 

Being  no  man  of  deep  designs,  pondering  on  no  combinations  of  long  10 

standing,  pursuing  no  great  object,  he  embarks  in  difficulties  with  a view to 
disentangle  himself  in  a  showy manner.  He  wants  complications  to  feed his 
activity,  and  when  he  finds  them  not  ready,  he  will create them.  He  exults 
in  show-conflicts,  show-battles,  show-enemies,  diplomatical  notes  to  be 
exchanged,  ships to be  ordered to  sail, the whole movement ending for him  15 
in violent parliamentary debates, which are sure to prepare him an ephemeral 
success,  the  constant  and  the  only  object  of  all  his  exertions.  He  manages 
international  conflicts  like  an  artist,  driving  matters  to  a  certain  point,  re 
treating when they threaten to  become  serious, but having got, at all events, 
the dramatic excitement he wants. In his eyes, the movement of history itself 20 
is  nothing  but  a  pastime,  expressly  invented  for  the  private  satisfaction  of 
the  noble  Viscount  Palmerston  of  Palmerston. 

Yielding  to  foreign  influence  in  facts,  he  opposes  it  in  words.  Having 
inherited  from  Canning  England's  mission  to  propagate  Constitutionalism 
on the  Continent,  he  is  never  in need  of  a theme to pique the national preju-  25 
dices,  and,  to  counteract  revolution  abroad,  and,  at  the  same  time,  to hold 
awake  the  suspicious  jealousy  of foreign powers.  Having  succeeded  in this 
easy  manner  to  become  the  bête  note  of  the  continental  courts,  he  could 
not fail in being set up  as the truly English minister at home. Although a Tory 
by  origin,  he  has  contrived  to  introduce  into  the  management  of  foreign  30 
affairs  all  the  shams  and  contradictions  that form  the  essence of Whiggism. 
He knows how to conciliate a democratic phraseology with oligarchic views, 
how  to  cover  the  peacemongering  policy  of  the  middle  classes  with  the 
haughty  language  of  England's  aristocratic  past—how  to  appear  as  the  ag 
gressor,  where  he  connives,  and  as  the  defender where he betrays—how to  35 
manage  an  apparent  enemy,  and  how  to  exasperate  a  pretended  ally—how 
to  find  himself,  at  the  opportune  moment  of  the  dispute,  on the  side  of  the 
stronger against the weak, and how to utter brave words in the act of running 
away. 

Accused  by  the  one  party  of being in  the  pay  of  Russia,  he is  suspected  40 

by  the  other  of  Carbonarism.  If,  in  1848,  he  had  to  defend  himself  against 

394 

Lord  Palmerston.  First  Article 

the  motion  of  impeachment for  having  acted  as  the minister of Nicholas, he 
had,  in  1850, the  satisfaction  of being persecuted by a conspiracy of foreign 
ambassadors,  which  was  successful  in  the  House  of  Lords,  but baffled  in 
the  House  of  Commons.  If he betrayed foreign peoples, he  did it with great 
5  politeness—politeness  being  the  small  coin  of  the  devil,  which  he  gives  in 
change  for  the  life-blood  of  his  dupes.  If  the  oppressors  were  always  sure 
of  his  active  support,  the  oppressed  did  never  want  a  great  ostentation  of 
his  rhetorical generosity.  Poles,  Italians,  Hungarians,  Germans,  found him 
in  office,  whenever  they  were  crushed, but their  despots  always  suspected 
10  him  of secret conspiracy with the victims they had allowed him to make. Till 
now,  in  all  instances,  it  was  a  probable  chance  of  success  to  have  him  for 
one's  adversary,  and  a  sure chance of ruin to have him for one's friend.  But, 
if  this  art  of  diplomacy  does  not  shine  in  the  actual  results  of  his  foreign 
negotiations,  it  shines  the  more brilliantly in the construction he induced the 
15  English people  to  lay upon them, by  accepting phrases for facts, phantasies 

for  realities,  and  high  sounding  pretexts  for  shabby  motives. 

Henry John Temple, Viscount Palmerston, deriving his title from a peerage 
of  Ireland,  was  nominated Lord of the  Admiralty in  1807,  on the formation 
of  the  Duke  of  Portland's  Administration.  In  1809,  he became  Secretary of 
20  War, and he continued to hold this office till May, 1828. In 1830 he went over, 
very  skilfully  too,  to  the  Whigs,  who  made  him  their  permanent  Secretary 
for  Foreign  Affairs.  Excepting  the  intervals  of  Tory  administration,  from 
November  1834  to  April  1835,  and  from  1841  to  1846, he is responsible for 
the  whole  foreign  policy,  England  has  pursued from the  revolution  of  1830 
to December  1851.

Is  it  not  a  very  curious  thing  to  find,  at  first  view,  that  Quixote  of  "free 
institutions,"  and that Pindarus  of the "glories  of the constitutional system," 
a permanent and an eminent member of the Tory administrations of Mr. Per 
ceval,  the  Earl of Liverpool,  Mr. Canning,  Lord  Goderich,  and the  Duke  of 
30  Wellington,  during  the  long  epoch  of  the  Anti-Jacobin war  carried  on,  the 
monster-debt  contracted,  the  Corn  Laws  promulgated,  foreign  mercenaries 
stationed  on  the  English  soil,  the  people—to  borrow  an  expression from  his 
colleague,  Lord  Sidmouth—"bled,"  from  time  to  time,  the  press  gagged, 
meetings  suppressed,  the  mass  of  the  nation  disarmed,  individual  liberty 
suspended  together  with  regular  jurisdiction,  the  whole  country  placed  as 
it  were  in a  state  of  siege—in one word,  during the  most infamous  and most 
reactionary  epoch  of  English  history? 

35 

His  debutin parliamentary life is a characteristic one. On February 3,1808, 
he rose to  defend—what?—secrecy in the working of diplomacy, and the most 
40  disgraceful  act  ever  committed  by  one  nation  against  another  nation,  viz., 
the bombardment  of Copenhagen, and the capture of the Danish fleet, at the 

395 

Karl  Marx 

time  when  England  professed  to  be  in  profound  peace  with  Denmark.  As 
to  the  former  point,  he  stated  that,  "In  this  particular  case,  his  Majesty's 
Ministers  are pledged  (by whom?) to  secrecy;" but he went farther:  "I also 
object  generally  to  making  public  the  working  of  diplomacy,  because  it  is 
the  tendency  of  disclosures  in that department to  shut up  future  sources  of 
information."  Vidocq  would  have defended the identical cause in the identi 
cal  terms.  As  to  the  act  of  piracy,  while  admitting that  Denmark had  evi 
denced no  hostility  whatever towards  Great  Britain,  he contended that they 
were  right  in  bombarding  its  capital  and  stealing its  fleet, because  they  had 
to  prevent  Danish  neutrality  from  being,  perhaps,  converted  into  open  10 
hostility  by  the  compulsion  of  France.  This  was  the  new  law  of  nations, 
proclaimed  by  my  lord  Palmerston.

When  again  speechifying,  we  find  that  English  minister  par  excellence, 
engaged  in  the  defence  of  foreign troops,  called  over from  the  continent to 
England,  with  the  express  mission  of  maintaining  forcibly  the  oligarchic  15 
rule,  to  establish which William  had,  in  1688, come over from Holland, with 
his  Dutch troops.  Palmerston answered to the well-founded  "apprehensions 
for  the  liberties  of  the  country,"  originating from the presence of the King's 
German Legion, in a very  flippant  manner.  Why  should we  not have  16,000 
of  those  foreigners  at  home;  while  you know,  that we  employ  "a far  larger  20 
proportion of foreigners  abroad."  (House of  Commons,  March  10,  1812.) 

When  similar  apprehensions  for  the  constitution  arose  from  the  large 
standing  army,  maintained  since  1815,  he  found  "a  sufficient protection of 
the  constitution in the  very  constitution of  our army,"  a large proportion of 
its  officers being  "men of property and  connexions."  (House of Commons,  25 
March  8,  1816.) 

When the large  standing army was  attacked from  a financial point of view, 
he  made  the  curious  discovery  that  "much  of  our financial embarrassments 
had  been  caused  by  our former  low  peace  establishment."  (House  of  Com 
mons,  April 25,  1816.) 

When the  "burdens  of  the  country,"  and the "misery of the people" were 
contrasted  with the lavish military expenditure, he reminded parliament that 
those  burdens  and  that  misery  "were  the  price  which  we  (viz.,  the  English 
oligarchy)  agreed  to  pay  for  our  freedom  and  independence."  (House  of 
Commons,  May  16,  1820.) 

In  his  eyes,  military  despotism  was  only  to  be  apprehended  from  the 
exertions  of  "those  self-called, but misled Reformers, who demand that  sort 
of reform  in the  country which, according to every first principle of govern 
ment,  must  end,  if  it  were  acceded to,  in  a  military  despotism."  (House of 
Commons, June  14,  1820.) 

While  large  standing  armies  were  thus  his  panacea  for  maintaining  the 

30 

35 

40 

396 

Lord  Palmerston.  First  Article 

constitution  of  the  country,  flogging  was  his  panacea  for  maintaining  the 
constitution  of  the  army.  He  defended  it in the  debates  on the  Mutiny Bill, 
on  the  5th  of  March,  1824,  he  declared  it  to  be  "absolutely  indispensable" 
on  March  11,  1825,  he  recommended  it  again  on March  10,  1828;  he  stood 
by  it  in the  debates  of  April,  1833,  and  he  proved  an  amateur  of  flogging  on 
every  subsequent  occasion. 

5 

There  existed  no  abuse  in  the  army,  he  did  not find  plausible reasons for, 
if  it  happened  to  foster  the  interests  of  aristocratic  parasites.  Thus,  for 
instance,  in  the  debates  on the  Sale  of  Commissions.  (House  of  Commons, 

10  March  12,  1828.) 

Lord  Palmerston  likes  to  parade  his  constant exertions  for  the  establish­
ment  of  religious  liberty.  Now,  he  voted  against  Lord  Russell's  motion for 
the  Repeal  of  Test  and  Corporation  Acts.  Why?  Because  he  was  "a  warm 
and  zealous  friend  to  religious  liberty,"  and  could,  therefore,  not  allow  the 
15  Dissenters  to  be  relieved  from  "imaginary  grievances,  while  real  afflictions 

20 

25 

30 

35 

pressed  upon  the  Catholics."  (House  of  Commons,  Feb. 26,  1828.) 

In  proof  of  his  zeal  for  religious  liberty he  informs  us  of his  "regret to  see 
the  increasing  numbers  of  the  Dissenters.  It  is  my  wish that the Established 
Church should be the predominant Church in this country," and it is his wish 
"that  the  Established  Church  should  be  fed  at  the  expense  of  the  misbe­
lievers."  His 
lordship  accuses  the  rich  Dissenters  of  affording 
churches  for the  poor ones, while  "with the Church of England it is the poor 
alone  who  feel  the  want  of  Church  accommodation  . ..  It  would  be  pre­
posterous  to  say,  that the  poor  ought  to  subscribe  for  churches  out  of their 
small  earnings."  (House  of  Commons,  April  9,  1824.) 

jocose 

It would be, of course, more preposterous yet to say, that the rich members 
of the  Established Church ought to  subscribe for the church out of their large 
earnings. 

Let us now look at his exertions for Catholic Emancipation, one of his great 
"claims"  on  the  gratitude  of  the  Irish  people.  I  shall  not  dwell  upon  the 
circumstances,  that,  having  declared  himself  for  Catholic  Emancipation, 
when  a  member  of  the  Canning  Ministry,  he  entered,  nevertheless,  the 
Wellington  Ministry,  avowedly  hostile  to  that  emancipation.  Perhaps  Lord 
Palmerston  considered  religious  liberty  as  one  of the  Rights  of  Man,  not to 
be  intermeddled with by Legislature.  He  may  answer for himself, "Although 
I  wish the  Catholic  claims  to  be  considered,  I  never will  admit those  claims 
to  stand  upon  the  ground  of  r i g h t . ..  Κ  I  thought the  Catholics  were  asking 
for  their  right,  I,  for  one,  would  not  go  into  the  committee."  (House  of 
Commons, March  1,  1813.) 

40 

And why is he opposed to their asking their right? "Because the Legislature 
of  a  country  has  the right to impose  such political  disabilities upon any class 

397 

1 

Karl  Marx 

of  the  community,  as  it  may  deem  necessary for  the  safety  and  the  welfare 
of the w h o l e . .. This belongs to the fundamental principles on which civilised 
government  is  founded."  (House  of  Commons,  March  1,  1813.) 

There  you  have  the  most  cynic  confession  ever  made,  that  the  mass  of 
the  people  have  no  rights  at  all,  but that  they  may  be  allowed that amount 
of immunities, the Legislature—or, in other words, the ruling class—may deem 
fit  to  grant  them.  Accordingly,  Lord  Palmerston  declared  in  plain  words, 
"Catholic  Emancipation  to  be  a  measure  of  grace  and  favour."  (House  of 
Commons,  Feb. 10,  1829.) 

5 

It was  then entirely upon the ground of expediency that he condescended 
to  discontinue  the  Catholic  disabilities.  And  what  was  lurking  behind  this 
expediency? 

10 

Being  himself  one  of  the  great  Irish  proprietors,  he  wanted  to  entertain 
the  delusion, that "other remedies for Irish evils than Catholic Emancipation 
are  impossible,"  that it  would  cure  absenteeism,  and prove  a  substitute for  15 
Poor  Laws.—(House  of  Commons,  March  18,  1829.) 

The  great philanthropist,  who  afterwards  cleared  his  Irish estates of their 
Irish natives could not allow Irish misery to darken,  even for a moment, with 
its  inauspicious  clouds,  the  bright  sky  of  the  landlords  and moneylords.  "It 
is true,"  he  said, "that the peasantry of Ireland do not enjoy all the comforts  20 
which  are  enjoyed  by  all  the  peasantry  of  England,"  (only  think  of  all  the 
comforts  enjoyed by a family at the rate of 7s.  a week.)  "Still," he continues, 
"still however, the Irish peasant has his comforts...  He is well supplied with 
fuel,  and  is  seldom,  (only  four  days  out  of  six),  at  a  loss  for  food.  What  a 
comfort!  But this is not all the comfort he has—he has a greater cheerfulness  25 
of  mind  than  his  English  fellow  sufferer!"-(House  of  Commons,  May  7, 
1829.)  . 

As  to  the  extortions  of  Irish  landlords,  he  deals  with them  in  as  pleasant 
a  way  as  with  the  comforts  of  the  Irish  peasantry.  "It  is  said that the  Irish 
landlord  insists  on the  highest possible  rent  that  can  be  extorted.  Why  Sir,  30 
I believe that is not a singular circumstance ; certainly in England the landlord 
does  the  same  thing."—(House  of  Commons,  May 7,  1829.) 

Are  we  then  to  be  surprised  that  the  man,  so  deeply  interested  in  the 
mysteries  of the  "glories  of the  English constitution,"  and the "comforts of 
her  free  institutions,"  should  aspire  at  spreading  them  all  over  the  Con-  35 
tinent?

When  the  Reform  Movement  had  grown  irresistible,  Lord  Palmerston  de 
serted  the  Tories,  and  slipped  into  the  Whiggery  camp.  Although  he  had 
apprehended  the  danger  of  military  despotism  springing  up,  not  from  the 
presence of  the  King's  German legion on the  English soil, nor from keeping 
large  standing  armies, but only from the  "self-called Reformers," he patron 
ised,  nevertheless,  already  in  1828,  the  extension  of  the  franchise  to  such 
large  industrial  places  as  Birmingham,  Leeds,  and  Manchester.  But  why? 
"Not  because  I  am  a  friend  to  Reform  in  principle,  but  because  I  am  its 

10  decided  enemy." 

20 

He  had  persuaded  liimself  that  some  timely  concessions  made  to  the 
overgrown  manufacturing  interest  might  be  the  surest  means  of  escaping 
"the introduction of general reform." (House of Commons, June 27th,  1828.) 
Once  allied  with  the  Whigs,  he  did  not  even  pretend  that  the  Reform  Bill 
15 aimed at breaking through the narrow trammels of the Venetian Constitution; 
but,  on the contrary, at the increase of its  strength and solidity, by disjoining 
the  middle  classes  from the people's opposition.  "The feelings of the middle 
classes  will  be  changed,  and  their  dissatisfaction will be  converted  into that 
attachment to the constitution, which will give to it a vast increase of strength 
and  sohdity."  He  consoled  the  peers  with the  prospect  of  the  Reform  Bill 
not  really  endangering  the  "influence  of  the  House  of  Lords,"  and  their 
"interfering  in  elections."  He  told the  aristocracy  that  the  constitution  was 
not  to  lose  its  feudal  character,  "the  landed  interest being the  great founda 
tion  upon  which  rests  the  fabric  of  society,  and  the  institutions  of  the 
country."  He  allayed  their  fears  by  throwing  out  the ironical hint that  "we 
have  been charged  with not being in earnest  or  sincere in our  desire  to give 
to  the  people  a  real  representation,"  that  "it was  said,  we  only proposed  to 
give  a  different kind of influence  to the  aristocracy  and the landed interest." 
He  went even as  far  as  to  own that, besides  the  inevitable  concession to  be 
30  made  to  the  middle classes,  "disfranchisement,"  viz., the  disfranchisement 
of  the  old  Tory rotten boroughs for the benefit of new Whig boroughs,  "was 
the  chief  and  leading  principle  of  the  Reform  Bill."  (House  of  Commons, 
March 24th,  1831,  and  May  14th,  1832.) 

25 

It is  now time  to return to the performances of the noble lord in the foreign 

35  branch  of  policy: 

In  1823, when,  consequent  on the  resolutions  of  the  Congress  of Verona, 
a  French army was marched into  Spain, in order to  overturn the constitution 
of  that country,  and  to  deliver  it up to the merciless revenge of the Bourbon 

399 

Karl  Marx 

idiot and his  suite of bigot monks, Lord Palmerston disclaimed any "Quixotic 
crusades  for  abstract principles,"  any intervention in "favour of the people," 
whose heroic resistance had  saved England from the  sway of Napoleon. The 
words he  addressed on that occasion to his Whig adversaries  are  a lively and 
true  picture  of  his  own  foreign  policy,  after  he  had turned himself into  the 
permanent  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  for  those  who  then  were  his  op 
ponents.  He  said, 

5 

"Some  would  have  had  us  use  threats  in  negotiation,  without  being  pre 
pared to  go to  war,  if  negotiation failed.  To  have talked  of war,  and to have 
meant neutrality; to have  threatened an army,  and to  have retreated behind  10 
a  state  paper;  to  have  brandished  the  sword  of  defiance  in  the  hour  of 
deliberation,  and  to  have  ended  in  a penful  of  protests  on the  day of battle, 
would  have  been the  conduct  of  a cowardly bully,  and  would  have  made us 
the  object  of  contempt,  and  the  laughing  stock  of  Europe."—(House  of 
Commons,  April 30,  1823.) 

15 

At  last,  we  arrive  at  the  Grecian-Turkish  debates,  affording  to  Lord 
Palmerston  the  first  opportunity  for  displaying  his  unrivalled talents,  as  the 
unflinching  and persevering advocate of Russian interests, in the Cabinet and 
in  the  House  of  Commons.  One  by  one,  he  re-echoed  all  the  watch  words 
given  out by Russia of Turkish cruelty,  Greek civilisation, religious liberty,  20 
Christianity, and  so forth.  At first, we meet him repudiating, in his ministerial 
capacity,  any intention of passing  "a censure" upon the meritorious  conduct 
"of  Admiral  Codrington,"  which had  caused  the  destruction  of  the  Turkish 
fleet  at  Navarino,  although  he  admits  that  "this  battle  took  place  against a 
power  with  which  we  are  not  at  war,"  and  that  it  was  "an  untoward  25 
event."—(House  of  Commons,  January  31,  1828.) 

Then,  having  retired  from  office,  he  opens  the  long  series  of  his  attacks 
upon  Aberdeen,  by  reproaching  him  with having  been too  slow in executing 
the  orders  of  Russia. 

"Has  there  been  much  more  energy  and  promptitude  in  fulfilling  our  30 

engagements  to  Greece?  July,  1829,  is  coming  fast  upon  us,  and  the treaty 
of July,  1827, is  still unexecuted  . .. The Morea, indeed, has been cleared of 
the  Turks  . ..  But  why  were  the  arms  of  France  checked  at the  Isthmus  of 
Corinth?  . ..  The  narrow  policy  of  England  stepped  in,  and  arrested  her 
progress  . ..  But  why  do  not  the  allies  deal  with  the  country  north  of  the  35 
Isthmus,  as  they  have  done  with  that  to  the  south,  and  occupy  at  once  all 
that  which  must be  assigned to Greece? I  should have thought that the  allies 
had  had  enough  of  negotiating  with  Turkey  about  Greece."—(House  of 
Commons,  June  1,  1829.) 

Prince  Metternich was,  as  is  generally  known,  at that  time  opposing  the  40 

encroachments  of  Russia,  and  accordingly  her  diplomatic  agents—I remind 

400 

Lord  Palmerston.  Second  Article 

you  of  the  despatches  of  Pozzo  di  Borgo  and  Prince  Liewen—had  been 
advised to represent Austria as the great enemy of Grecian emancipation and 
of  European civilisation,  the  furtherance  of  which was  the  exclusive object 
of  Russian  diplomacy.  The  noble  lord  follows,  of  course,  in  the  beaten 
track. 

5 

"By the narrowness of her views, the unfortunate prejudices of her policy, 
Austria  almost  reduced  herself  to  the  level  of  a  second-rate  power;"  and 
consequent  on  the  temporising  policy  of  Aberdeen,  England  is  represented 
as "the key-stone of that arch of which Miguel, Spain, Austria, and Mahmoud 
10  are  the  component parts  . ..  People  see  in  the delay in executing the treaty 
of  July  not  so  much  fear  of  Turkish  resistance  as  invincible  repugnance  to 
Grecian freedom."—(House  of  Commons,  June  11,  1829.) 

Again he  assails  Aberdeen because  of  his  anti-Russian  diplomacy:  "I, for 
one,  shaU not be  satisfied with a number of despatches from the government 
15  of  England,  which  will  no  doubt  read  well  and  smooth  enough,  urging,  in 
general  terms,  the  propriety  of  conciliating  Russia,  but  accompanied,  per 
haps,  by  strong  expressions  of  the  regard  which  England  bore  to  Turkey, 
which,  when read by  an interested party,  might  easily  appear to  mean more 
than was really intended...  I should like to  see that, whilst England adopted 
20  a  firm  resolution—almost  the  only  course  she  could  adopt—upon  no  con 
sideration  and  in  no  event  to  take  part  with  Turkey  in  that  war—that  that 
decision was  fairly  and frankly communicated to T u r k e y . ..  There  are three 
most  merciless  things—time,  fire,  and  the  Sultan."—(House  of  Commons, 
Feb. 16,  1830.) 

25 

Arrived  at  this  point,  I  must recall  to  memory  some few historical facts, 
in  order  to  leave  no  doubt  about  the  meaning  of  the  noble  lord's  philo-
Hellenic  feelings. 

Russia, having seized upon Gokcheh,  a strip  of land bordering on the Lake 
of  Sevan,  which  was  an  indisputed  possession  of  Persia,  demanded  as  the 
30  price of its evacuation the abandonment of Persia's claims to another portion 
of her own territory, the lands of Kapan. Persia not yielding, she was overrun, 
vanquished,  and  forced  to  subscribe  to  the  treaty  of  Turcomanchai,  in 
February,  1828.  According  to  this  treaty  Persia had to pay an indemnity Of 
two millions  sterling to Russia to  cede the provinces of Erivan and Nuktcha-
35  van, including the fortresses of Erivan and Abassabad, the exclusive purpose 
of this  arrangement being,  as  Nicholas  stated, to  define the common frontier 
by  the  Araxes,  the  only  means, he  said,  of  preventing  any future  dispute  of 
the two  empires, although he refused  simultaneously to give back Talish and 
Moghan, which are situated on the Persian bank of the Araxes. Finally, Persia 
40  pledged  herself  to  maintaining  no  navy  on the  Caspian Sea.  Such were the 

origin  and  the  results  of  the  Russo-Persian  war.

As  to  the  religion  and  the  liberty  of  Greece,  Russia  cared  at  that  epoch 
as  much  about  them as the god of the  Russians  cares  now  about the  key  of 
the  "Holy  Sepulchre"  and  the  famous  "Cupola."  It  was  the  traditionary 
policy  of Russia, to  excite the  Greeks to  revolt,  and,  then,  to  abandon them 
to  the  revenge of the Sultan.  So deep was her sympathy for the regeneration 
of Hellas, that she treated them as rebels on the congress of Verona, acknow 
ledging  the  right  of  the  Sultan  to  exclude  all  foreign  intervention between 
himself and his  Christian subjects. Yea, the Czar offered "to  aid the Porte in 
suppressing  the  rebellion;"  a  proposition  which  was,  of  course,  rejected. 
Having failed  in that attempt,  he  turned round upon the  Great Powers  with  10 
the opposite proposition,  "To march an army into Turkey, for the purpose of 
dictating peace  under  the  walls  of the  Seraglio."  In order to  hold his  hands 
bound by a sort of common action, the other Great Powers concluded a treaty 
with  him  at  London,  July  6,  1827,  by  which  they  mutually  engaged  in  en 
forcing,  if  need be, by arms,  the  adjustment of the  differences between the  15 
Sultan and the Greeks.  A few months after she had signed that treaty, Russia 
concluded  another  treaty with Turkey, the treaty of Akerman, by which she 
bound  herself  to  renounce  all  interference  with  Grecian  affairs.  This  treaty 
was  brought  about,  after  Russia  had  induced  the  crown prince  of Persia to 
invade  the  Ottoman dominions,  and  after  she  had  inflicted  the  greatest in-  20 
juries on the Porte, in order to drive her to a rupture. After all this had passed, 
the  resolutions  of  the  London  treaty  of  July 6,1827, were presented to  the 
Porte  by  the  English  Ambassador,  or  in  the  name  of  Russia  and  the  other 
Powers.  By  virtue  of  the  complications  resulting from these frauds and lies, 
Russia found  at last the pretext for beginning the war of  1828 and  1829. That  25 
war  terminated  with  the  treaty of  Adrianople,  whose  contents  are  resumed 
in  the  following  quotations  from  McNeill's  celebrated  pamphlet  on  the 
"Progress  of  Russia  in  the  East":  "By  the  treaty  of  Adrianople  the  Czar 
acquired  Anapa  and  Poti  with  a  considerable  extent  of  coast  on  the  Black 
Sea,  a  portion  of  the  Pashalik of Akhilska, with the fortresses  of  Akhilska,  30 
and  Akhilkillak,  the  islands  formed  by  the  mouths  of the Danube, the  stip 
ulated  destruction  of  the  Turkish  fortress  of  Georgiova,  and  the  abandon 
ment  by  Turkey  of  the  right  bank  of  the  Danube  to  the  distance  of  several 
miles  from  the  river  . ..  partly  by  force,  and  partly  by  the  influence  of  the 
priesthood,  many  thousand  families  of  the  Armenians  were  removed from  35 
the  Turkish provinces  in Asia to  the  Czar's territories  . ..  He established for 
his own subjects in Turkey an exemption from all responsibility to the natio 
nal  authorities,  and  burdened  the  Porte  with  an  immense  debt,  under  the 
name  of expenses for  the war  and for commercial losses—and, finally retain 
ed Moldavia, Wallachia, and Silistria, in pledge for the payment... Having by  40 
this treaty imposed upon Turkey the acceptance of the protocol of March 22,

which  secured  the  suzerainty  of  Greece,  and  a  yearly  tribute  from  that 
country,  Russia  used  ail  her  influence  to  procure  the  independence  of 
Greece, which was  erected  into  an independent  state,  of which Count Capo 
d'Istria,  who  had  been  a  Russian  Minister,  was  named  President."

Such are the facts. Now look at the picture drawn of them by Lord Palmer-
ston's  hand:—"It  is  perfectly  true  that  the  war  between  Russia  and Turkey 
arose  out  of  aggressions  made  by  Turkey  on  the  commerce  and  rights  of 
Russia,  and  violations  of  treaties."—(House  of Commons,  Feb.  16,1830.) 

When  the  Whig-incarnation  of  the  office  of  Foreign Affairs,  he improved 
10  on  this  statement:—"The  honourable  and  gallant  member  (Col. Evans)  has 
represented the conduct of Russia as one of unvarying aggression, upon other 
States  from  1815  to  the  present  time.  He  adverted more  particularly to the 
wars  of Russia with Persia and Turkey.  Russia was  the  aggressor in neither 
of  them,  and  although  the  result  of the Persian war was  an aggrandisement 
15 of her power, it was not the result of her own seeking... Again, in the Turkish 
war, Russia was not the aggressor.  It would be fatiguing to the house to detail 
all  the  provocations  Turkey  offered  to  Russia;  but  I believe there cannot be 
a  doubt  that  she  expelled  Russian  subjects  from  her  territory,  detained 
Russian  ships,  and  violated  all the provisions  of the  treaty of Akerman, and 
then, upon complaint being made,  denied redress—so that, if there ever was 
a  just  ground  for  going  to  war,  Russia  had  it for  going to  war  with Turkey. 
She  did not,  however,  on any  occasion,  acquire  any increase  of territory, at 
least  in  Europe.  I  know  there  was  a  continued  occupation  of  certain 
points"—(Moldavia  and  Wallachia  are  only  points,  and  the  mouths  of  the 
25  Danube  are  mere  zeros)—"and  some  additional  acquisitions  on  the  Euxine 
in  Asia;  but  she  had  an  agreement  with  the  other  European  powers  that 
success  in  that  war  should  not  lead  to  any  aggrandisement  in  Europe."—

Your  readers  will  now  understand  Sir  Robert Peel's telling the noble lord, 
in  a public  session of the house, that "he did not know whose representative 
he  was."

The  noble  viscount  is  generally  known  as  the  chivalrous  protector  of  the 
Poles, and never fails to give vent to his painful f eelings with regard to Poland 
35  before  the  deputations  that wait upon him  once  every year by  "dear,  dully, 

403 

Karl  Marx 

deadly"  Dudley  Stuart,  "a worthy  who  makes speeches, passes resolutions, 
votes  addresses,  goes  up  with  deputations,  has  at  all  times  the  necessary 
quantity  of  confidence  in  the  necessary  individual,  and  can,  also,  if  neces 
sary,  give  three  cheers  for  the  Queen."

The  Poles  had been in arms  for  about a month when the  noble lord  came 
into  office,  in  November,  1830.  As  early  as  August  8th,  1831,  Mr. Hunt 
presents  to  the  House  of  Commons  a petition from the Westminster Union, 
in  favour  of  the  Poles,  and  "for  the  dismissal  of  Lord  Palmerston  from  his 
Majesty's  councils."  Mr. Hume  stated  on  the  same  day he  concluded  from 
the  silence  of  the  noble  lord  that the  government  "intended to  do  nothing  10 
for  the  Poles,  but  allow  them  to  remain  at  the  mercy  of  Russia."  Lord 
Palmerston  replied  that,  "whatever  obligations  existing  treaties  imposed, 
would  at all times  receive  the  attention of the government." Now, what sort 
of  obligation  was  there  imposed  in  his  opinion  upon  England  by  existing 
treaties?  "The  claims  of  Russia,"  he  tells  us  himself,  "to the possession of  15 
Poland bear the  date  of the treaty of Vienna."-{House  of Commons, July 9, 
1833.) 

And  that treaty  makes  this  possession  dependent upon the observance of 
the  Polish constitution by  the  Czar,  but  "the  mere fact of this country being 
a party to  the  treaty of  Vienna, was  not  synonymous with our guaranteeing  20 
that  there  would  be  no  infraction  of  that  treaty  by  Russia.  ' M H o u se  of 
Commons,  March 25,  1834.) 

If  you  guarantee  a  treaty, you do  by no  means  guarantee  the  observance 
of the treaty.  Thus  answered the Milanese to the Emperor Barbarossa: "You 
have  had  our  oath,  but remember  we  did  not  swear  to  keep  it." 

25 

For one thing, however, the treaty of Vienna is good. It gives to the British 
government,  as  one  of  the  contracting  parties,  "a  right  to  entertain  and 
express  an  opinion  on  any  act  which  tends  to  a  violation  of  that  treaty  . .. 
The  contracting  parties  to  the  treaties  of  Vienna had a right to require that 
the  constitution  of  Poland  should  not  be  touched,  and  this  was  an  opinion  30 
which I  have  not  concealed from the  Russian government.  I  communicated 
it  by anticipation to  that  government  previous  to  the  taking  of Warsaw,  and 
before  the  result  of  hostilities  was  known.  I  communicated  it  again  when 
Warsaw  fell.  The  Russian  government,  however,  took  a  different  view  of 
the  question."—{House  of  Commons, July 9,  1833.) 

35 

He  is  quietly  anticipating  the  downfall  of  Poland,  and  watches  this  op 
portunity  for  expressing  and  entertaining  an  opinion  on  certain  articles  of 
the  treaty  of  Vienna,  persuaded  as  he  is  that  the  magnanimous  Czar  waits 
only for having crushed the  Polish people by armed force, in order to honour 
a  constitution  trampled  upon  when  they  were  yet possessed  of unbounded  40 
means  of  resistance.  Simultaneously  the  noble  lord  charges  the  Poles  with 

404 

Lord  Palmerston.  Third  Article 

having  "taken  the  uncalled-for,  and,  in  his  opinion,  unjustifiable  step  of the 
dethronement  of  the  Emperor."—(House  of  Commons,  July  9,  1833.) 

"He  could  also  saythat the Poleswere the aggressors,for they commenced 

the  contest."—(House  of  Commons,  August  7,  1832.) 

5  When  the  apprehensions  for  the  extinction  of  Poland  became  troublesome, 
he  declared  that  "to  exterminate  Poland,  either  morally or politically, is  so 
perfectly impracticable that I think there need be no apprehension of its being 
attempted."—(House  of  Commons,  June  28,  1832.) 

When  reminded  afterwards  of  the  wayward  expectations  thus  held  out, 
10  he  assures  that  he  had been  misunderstood,  that  he  had  said  so  not in the 
political but in the Pickwickian sense of the word, meaning that the Emperor 
of  Russia  was  unable  "to  exterminate  nominally  or physically  so  many 
millions  of  men  as  the  Polish  kingdom  in  its  divided  state  contained."— 
(House  of  Commons,  April 20,  1836.) 

15 

When the  house makes  a pretence of interfering during the struggle of the 
Poles,  he  appeals  to  his  ministerial  responsibility.  When the  thing  is  done, 
he coolly tells them that "no vote of this house would have the slightest effect 
in reversing the  decision of Russia."—(House  of  Commons, July 9,  1833.) 

20 

When the  atrocities  committed  by  the  Russians,  after  the  fall  of Warsaw, 
are  denounced,  he  recommends  to  the  house  great tenderness  towards the 
Emperor  of  Russia, declaring that "no person could regret more than he  did, 
the  expressions  which  had  been  uttered,"  (House  of  Commons,  June  28, 
1832,)  that  "the  present  Emperor  of  Russia was  a man of high and generous 
feelings"—that  "where  cases  of  undue  severity  on  the  part  of  the  Russian 
25  government  to  the  Poles  have  occurred,  we  may  set this  down  as  a proof 
that  the  power  of the  Emperor  of Russia is  practically Umited,  and we  may 
take  it  for  granted  that  the  Emperor  has,  in  those  instances,  yielded to  the 
influence  of  others,  rather  than  followed  the  dictates  of  his  spontaneous 
feelings."—(House  of  Commons,  July  9,  1833.) 

30 

When  the  doom  of  Poland  was  sealed  on  the one  hand,  and on the other 
the  dissolution  of  the  Turkish  empire became  imminent,  from  the  rebellion 
of  Mehemet  Ali,  he  assured the house that "affairs  in general were proceed 
ing  in  a  satisfactory  train."—(House  of  Commons,  January  26,  1832.) 

A  resolution  for  granting  subsidies  to  the  Polish  refugees  having  been 
35  moved,  it  is  "exceedingly  painful  to  him to  oppose the grant of any  money 
to  those  individuals  which  the  natural  and  spontaneous  feelings  of  every 
generous  man  would  lead  him  to  acquiesce in;  but,  it is  not consistent with 
his  duty  to  propose  any  grant  of  money  to  those  unfortunate  persons."— 
(House  of  Commons,  March 25,  1834.) 

40 

The  same  tender-hearted  man  had  defrayed  as  we  shall  see  by  and  bye, 
the  cost  of  Poland's  fall,  to  a great extent,  out  of the pockets  of the  British 
people.

The  noble  lord  has  taken  good  care  to  withhold  all  state  papers  on  the 
Polish  catastrophe  from  the  parliament.  But  statements  made  in the  House 
of  Commons  which,  he  did  never  as  much  as  attempt  to  controvert,  leave 
no  doubt  as  to  the  game  he  played  at  that  fatal  epoch.

After  the Polish revolution had broken out,  the  Consul  of  Austria did not 
quit  Warsaw,  and  the  Austrian  government  went  so  far  as to  send  a Polish 
agent, M. Walewski, to Paris, with the mission of negotiating with the govern 
ments of France and England about the re-establishment of a Polish kingdom. 
The  Court  of  the  Tuileries  declared  "it was  ready  to  join  England  in  case 
of her consenting to the project." Lord Palmerston rejected the offer. In 1831 
M.de  Talleyrand,  the  Ambassador  of  France,  at  the  Court  of  St. James, 
proposed  a plan  of  combined  action  on the  part  of  France  and England, but 
met with  a  distinct refusal,  and  with  a note  from  the  noble  lord,  stating that 
"an  amicable  intermediation  on  the  Polish  question  would  be  declined  by 
Russia.  The  powers  had just declined  a  similar  offer  on the  part of  France;  15 
the  intervention of  the two  Courts  of  France  and  England  could  only be by 
force  in  case.of  a refusal  on the  part of  Russia,  and  the  amicable  and  satis 
factory  relations  between  the  Cabinet  of  St. James  and  the  Cabinet  of 
St. Petersburg,  would  not  allow  his  British  Majesty  to  undertake  such  an 
interference.  The  time  was  n ot  y et  come  to  undertake  such  a  plan  with  20 
success against the will of a sovereign, whose rights were indisputable" This 
was not all.  On February 23,1848, Mr. Anstey made the following declaration 
in  the  House  of  Commons:—"Sweden  was  arming  her  fleet for  the  purpose 
of  making  diversion  in  favour  of  Poland,  and  of  regaining  to  herself  the 
provinces  in the  Baltic, which have been so unjustly wrested from her in the  25 
last  war.  The  noble  lord  instructed  our  ambassador  at  the  Court  of  Stock 
holm,  in  a  contrary  sense,  and  Sweden  discontinued  her  armaments.  The 
Persian  Court had,  with  similar  purpose,  despatched  an army  three  days  on 
its  march  towards  the  Russian  frontier,  under  the  command  of  the  Persian 
crown prince.  The  Secretary  of  Legation,  at the Court of Teheran,  Sir John  30 
McNeill followed the prince, at a distance of three days' marchfrom his head 
quarters,  overtook  him,  and  there,  under  instructions  from  the  noble  lord, 
and  in  the  name  of  England,  threatened  Persia  with  war  if  the  prince  ad 
vanced  another  step towards the Russian frontier.  Similar inducements were 
used by the noble lord to prevent Turkey from renewing war on her side." 

35 

To  Colonel  Evans  asking  for  the  production  of  papers  with  regard  to 
Prussia's  violation  of  her  pretended  neutrality in  the  Russo-Polish war,  the 
noble  lord  objected,  "that  the  ministers  of  this  country  could  not  have 
witnessed  that  contest  without  the  deepest  regret,  and  it  would  be  most 
satisfactory for them to see it terminated."—(House of Commons, August 16, 40 
1831.) 

406 

Lord  Palmerston.  Third  Article 

Certainly  he  wished  to  see  it terminated  as  soon as possible,  and Prussia 

shared  in  his  feelings. 

10 

On  a  subsequent  occasion,  Mr. H. Gaily  Knight  thus  resumed  the  whole 
proceedings  of the noble lord with regard to the Polish insurrection:—"There 
5 is something curiously inconsistent in the proceedings of the noble lord when 
Russia  is  concerned  . ..  On  the  subject  of  Poland,  the  noble  lord  has  dis 
appointed  us  again  and  again.  Remember  when  the  noble lord was  pressed 
to  exert  himself  in  favour  of  Poland,  then  he  admitted  the  justice  of  the 
cause—the  justice  of  our  complaints;  but he  said,  'Only restrain yourselves 
at  present,  there  is  an  ambassador  fast  setting  out  of  known  liberal  senti 
ments,  you may be  sure we will do  all that is  right;  you will only embarrass 
his  négociation,  if you incense the power with whom he has to deal.  So, take 
my  advice,  be  quiet  at  present,  and  be  assured  that  a  great  deal  will  be 
effected.'  We  trusted  to  those  assurances;  the  Uberai  ambassador  went; 
15  whether  he  ever  approached  the  subject  or  not,  was  never  known,  but  all 
we  got  were  the  fine  words  of  the  noble  lord,  and  no  results."—(House  of 
Commons,  July  13,  1840.) 

The  so-called  kingdom  of  Poland  having  disappeared  from  the  map  of 
Europe, there remained  still, in the free town of Cracow, a fantastic remnant 
20  of  Polish  nationality.  The  Czar  Alexander  had,  during  the  general  anarchy 
resulting  from  the  fall  of  the  French  empire,  not  conquered  the  Duchy  of 
Warsaw, but simply seized it, and wished, of course, to keep it, together with 
Cracow, incorporated with the Duchy by Bonaparte. Austria, once possessed 
of Cracow, wished to have it back. The Czar being unable to obtain it himself 
and unwilling to concede it to Austria, proposed to constitute it as a free town. 
Accordingly the  treaty of  Vienna  stipulated in  article  VI.,  "that the  town of 
Cracow  with  the  territory  is  to be  for ever a free,  independent,  and  strictly 
neutral  city,  under  the  protection  of  Austria,  Russia,  and  Prussia,"  and  in 
its  article  IX.  "that  the  Courts  of  Russia,  Austria,  and  Prussia  engage  to 
respect,  and to  cause  to  be  always respected, the neutrality of the free town 
of Cracow and its territory.  No armed force shall be introduced upon any 
pretence  whatever." 

25 

30 

Immediately  after  the  close  of  the  Polish  insurrection  of  1830-31,  the 
Russian troops  suddenly entered Cracow, the occupation of which lasted two 
35  months.  This, however, was considered as a transitory necessity of war, and 

in the  turmoil  of  that  time,  was  soon  forgotten. 

In  1836,  Cracow  was  again occupied by the troops of Austria, Russia, and 
Prussia,  on  the  pretext  of forcing the  authorities  of Cracow to  deliver up the 
individuals  concerned  in  the  Polish  revolution  five  years  before.  The  con-
stitution  of Cracow was  abrogated, the three consular residencers  assumed 
the  highest  authority—the police  was  entrusted to Austrian spies—the  senate 

40 

407 

Karl  Marx 

was  overthrown—the tribunals were  destroyed—the university of Cracow put 
down in consequence of the prohibitions  to the neighbouring provinces—and 
the  commerce  of  the  free  city  with the  surrounding  countries  destroyed. 

5 

On  March  18th,  1836,  when  interpellated  on  the  occupation  of  Cracow, 
the  noble  viscount  declared  that  occupation  to  be  of  a  merely  transitory 
character.  Of  so  palliative  and apologetic a kind was the construction he put 
on the doings of his three northern allies, that he felt himself obliged suddenly 
to  stop  and to interrupt the even course  of his  speech by the  solemn declara 
tion  "I  stand  not  up  here  to  defend  the  measure,  which,  on  the contrary,  I 
m u st  censure  and  condemn.  I  have  merely  stated  those  circumstances  10 
which,  though they  do  not excuse  the  forcible occupation of Cracow, might 
yet afford a justification, etc 
"  He  admits that the treaty of Vienna bound 
the  three  Powers  to  abstain  from  any  step  without the  previous  consent of 
England,  but,  "they  may  be  justly  said  to  have  paid  an  in  voluntary  homage 
to the justice  and plain dealing of this  country, by  supposing that we  would  15 
never  give  our  assent  to  such  a  proceeding." 

Mr.Patrick  M.Stewart  having,  however,  found  out  that  there  existed 
better  means  for  the  preservation  of  Cracow  than  the  "abstention  from 
remonstrance,"  moved  on  April  20,  1836,  that  the  government  should  be 
ordered to  send a representation to the free town of Cracow as consul, there 
being three  consuls  there from  the  three  Northern Powers. The joint arrival 
of an English and French consul at Cracow would prove an event. The noble 
viscount  seeing  that  the  majority  of  the  house  was  for  the  motion,  induced 
Mr.  Stewart to withdraw it by  solemnly pledging himself that the government 
"intended  to  send  a  consular  agent to  Cracow."  On  March 22,  1837,  being  25 
reminded  by  Lord  Dudley  Stuart  of  his  promise,  the  noble  lord  answered 
that  "he  had  altered  his  intention,  and  had  not  sent  a  consular  agent  to 
Cracow,  and  it  was  not  at  present  his  intention  to  do  so."  Lord  D. Stuart 
having given notice that he  should move for papers elucidatory of this singu 
lar declaration, the  noble viscount  succeeded in defeating the motion by the 
simple process of being absent and of causing the house  to be counted out. 

20 

30 

In  1840, the "temporary"  occupation continued, and the people of Cracow 
had  addressed  a  memorandum  to  the  governments  of  France  and  England, 
which  says,  amongst  other  things:—"The  misfortunes  which  overwhelm the 
free  city  of  Cracow  and  its  inhabitants,  are  such  that  the  undersigned  see  35 
no further hope for themselves  and their fellow  citizens  than in the  powerful 
and  enlightened  protection  of  the  governments  of  France  and England.  The 
situation in  which they  find themselves  placed,  gives  them  a right to invoke 
the  intervention of  every  power  that  subscribed  to  the  treaty  of Vienna." 

Being  interrogated  on  July  13th,  1840,  about this  petition  from  Cracow,  40 

the  noble  viscount  declared  "that  between  Austria  and  the  British govern-

408 

Lord  Palmerston.  Third  Article 

5 

15 

ment the  question of the  evacuation  of  Cracow remained only a question of 
time."  As  to  the  violation  of  the  treaty of Vienna  "there were  no  means  of 
enforcing the opinions of England,  supposing that this country was disposed 
to  do  so  by  arms,  because  Cracow was  evidently a place  where  no  English 
action  could  possibly  take  place."  Be  it  remarked  that two  days  after  this 
declaration  the  noble  lord  concluded  a  treaty  with  Russia,  Austria,  and 
Prussia for  closing the  Black  Sea to the English navy, probably in order that 
no  English action could  take  place in those quarters. It was at the very same 
time  that the  noble  lord  renewed  a Holy  Alliance  with those Powers  against 
10  France.  As  to  the  commercial  loss  sustained by England, consequent upon 
the  occupation  of  Cracow,  the  noble  lord demonstrated that "the amount of 
general  exports  to  Germany had  not  fallen  off,"  which,  as  Sir  Robert  Peel 
justly remarked,  had nothing to  do with Cracow.  As to  his intentions on the 
subject  and  to  the  consular  agent to  be  sent  to  Cracow,  "he thought that his 
experience  of  the  manner  in  which  his  unfortunate  assertion  (made  by the 
noble  lord  in  1836,  in  order  to  escape  from  the  censure  of  a hostile  house) 
of  an intention  to  appoint  a British  Consul  at  Cracow, had been taken up by 
honourable  gentlemen  opposite,  justified  him  in  positively  refusing to  give 
any  answer  to  such  a  question,  which  might  expose  him  to  similar  un-
justifiable  attacks."  On  August  17,1846, he  stated that "whether the treaty 
of  Vienna is, or is not executed and fulfilled by the Great Powers of Europe, 
depends  not  upon  the  presence  of  a  consular  agent  at  Cracow."  On  Janu 
ary  28,1847,  when  again  asked  for  the  production  of papers  relative  to  the 
non-appointment oí  a British Consul  at Cracow, he  declared that "the  subject 
25  had  no  necessary  connexion  with  the  discussion  on  the  incorporation  of 
Cracow, and he saw no advantage in reviving an angry discussion on a subject 
which  had  only  a passing interest."  He  proved  true  to  his  opinion  on the 
production  of  state  papers,  pronounced  on March  17,1837:—"If  the  papers 
bear  upon  questions  now  under  consideration,  their  production  would  be 
30  dangerous;  if  they  refer  to  questions  that  are  gone  by,  they  can obviously 

20 

be of no use." 

35 

The  British  government  was  very  exactly informed  of the  importance  of 
Cracow, not only from a. political but also from a commercial point of view, 
their  own  Consul  at  Warsaw,  Colonel  Duplat  having  reported  to  them that 
"Cracow,  since its elevation into  an independent  state, has  always been the 
depot  of  very  considerable  quantities  of  English  merchandise  sent  thither 
by the  Black  Sea,  Moldavia,  and  Gallicia,  and  even  via Trieste;  and which 
afterwards find their way to  the surrounding countries. In the course of years 
it came into railway communication with the great Unes of Bohemia, Prussia, 
40  and  Austria  . ..  It  is  also  the  central  point of  the  important  line  of  railway 
communication  between  the  Adriatic  and  the  Baltic.  It  will  come  in  direct 

409 

Karl  Marx 

communication of the  same  description with W a r s a w . .. Looking, therefore, 
to the  almost certainty  of  every  great point of the  Levant, and even of India 
and  China,  finding  its  way  up  the  Adriatic,  it cannot be  denied that it must 
be  of  the  greatest  commercial  importance,  even  to  England,  to  have  such 
a  station as  Cracow, in the centre of the great net of railways connecting the 
Western  and  Eastern  Continent." 

5 

Lord  Palmerston  himself  was  obliged  to  confess  to  the  house  that  the 
Cracow  insurrection  of  1846  had  been intentionally  provoked by  the  Three 
Powers.  "I  believe  the  original  entrance  of  the  Austrian  troops  into  the 
territory  of  Cracow was in consequence  of an  application from the govern-  10 
ment.  But,  then,  those  Austrian  troops  retired.  Why they retired  has  never 
yet  been  explained.  With  them  retired  the  government  and  the  authorities 
of  Cracow ; the  immediate,  at least,  the  early  consequence of that retirement, 
was  the  establishment  of  a  provisional  government  at  Cracow."  (House  of 
Commons, Aug. 17,  1846.) 

15 

On  the  22nd  of  February,  1846,  the  army  of  Austria,  and  afterwards  of 
Russia  and  Prussia,  took  possession  of  Cracow.  On  the  26th  of  the  same 
month  the  Prefect  of  Tarnow  issued  his  proclamation  calling  upon  the 
peasants  to  murder  their  proprietors,  and  promising  them  "a  sufficient 
recompence,  in money,"  which proclamation was followed by the Gallician  20 
atrocities,  and  the  massacre  of  about  2,000  proprietors.  On  March  the 
12th  appeared  the  Austrian  proclamation  to  the  "faithful  Gallicians  having 
aroused themselves for the maintenance of order and law,  and destroyed the 
enemies  of  order."  In the  official  "Gazette"  of  April 28th, Prince  Frederick 
of  Schwarzenberg  stated  that  "the  acts  that  had  taken  place  had  been  25 
authorised  by  the  Austrian  government,"  which,  of  course,  acted  on  a 
common plan with Russia  and with Prussia,  the  footman of  the  Czar.  Now, 
after  all  these  abominations  had  passed,  Lord  Palmerston  thought  fit  to 
declare  in the  house,  "I  have  too  high an opinion of the  sense of justice and 
of right that must animate  the governments of Austria, Russia, and Prussia,  30 
to believe that they can feel  any disposition or intention to deal with Cracow 
otherwise  than  Cracow  is  entitled  by  treaty-engagements  to  be  dealt with." 
(House  of  Commons,  Aug.  17th,  1846.) 

For the  noble  lord  the  only business  in hand was  to  get rid of parliament, 
the  session  drawing  to  a  close.  He  assured the Commons that "on the part  35 
of  the  British  government  everything  shall  be  done  to  ensure  a due  respect 
being  paid to  the  provisions of the treaty of Vienna."  Mr. Hume, giving vent 
to  his  doubts  about  Lord Palmerston's  "intention to  cause  the  Austro-Rus-
sian  troops  to  retire  from  Cracow,"  the  noble  lord  begged of the  house  not 
to give  credence to the  statements made  by Mr. Hume,  as  he was in posses-  40 
sion of better information,  and was  convinced that the occupation of Cracow 

410 

Lord  Palmerston.  Third  Article

was  only  a  " t e m p o r a r y"  one.  The parliament of  1846 having been got rid 
of, in the  same  manner  as  that  of  1853,  out came the  Austrian proclamation 
of November  11th,  1846, incorporating Cracow into the Austrian dominions. 
When  parliament  re-assembled  on  January  19th,  1847,  it  was  informed  by 
the  Queen's  Speech  that  Cracow  was  gone,  but  that there  remained  in  its 
place  a  protest on the  part  of the brave  Palmerston.  To  deprive this  protest 
of  even  the  appearance  of  a  meaning,  the  noble lord  contrived  at that very 
epoch  to  engage,  on  the  occasion  of  the  Spanish  marriages,  England  in  a 
quarrel  with  France,  very  near  setting  the  two  countries  by  the  ears,  as  he 
10  was  twitted  in  the  teeth  by  Mr. Smith  O'Brien.  The  French  government 
having  applied  to  him  for  his  co-operation  in  a  joint  protest  against  the 
incorporation  of  Cracow, Lord Normanby, under instructions from the noble 
viscount,  answered  that  the  outrage  of  which  Austria  had  been  guilty  in 
annexing  Cracow was  not greater than that of  France in effecting  a marriage 
15 between the Duke of Montpensier and the Spanish Inf anta—the one act being 
a  violation  of  the  treaty  of  Vienna,  and  the  other  of  the  treaty  of  Utrecht. 
Now,  the  treaty of  Utrecht, renewed  in  1782,  was  definitively  abrogated by 
the  Anti-Jacobin  war;  and  had,  therefore,  ever  since  1792  ceased  to  exist. 
There  was  no  man  in  the  house  better  informed  of  this  circumstance  than 
the noble lord,  as he had  stated himself on the occasion of the blockades of 
Mexico  and Buenos Ayres, that "the provisions of the treaty of Utrecht have 
long  lapsed  in  the variations  of  war,  with the  exception of the  single  clause 
relating to  the  boundaries  of Brazil and  French Guyana, because that clause 
had  been  expressly  incorporated  in  the  treaty  of  Vienna." 

20 

25 

We  have  not  yet  done  with  the  exertions  of  the  noble  lord  for  resisting 

the  encroachments  of  Russia  on  Poland. 

There  existed  a  curious  convention between England,  Holland,  and  Rus 
sia—the so-called Russian Dutch loan. During the Anti-Jacobin war the Czar 
Alexander had  contracted a loan with Messrs.  Hope and  Co., at Amsterdam ; 
and  after  the  fall  of  Buonaparte,  the  King  of  the  Netherlands  "deshed  to 
make  a  suitable return to  the  Allied Powers  for having  delivered  his territo 
ries,"  and  for  having  annexed  to  his  own  Belgium,  upon  which  he  had  no 
claim  whatever,  and  engaged  himself—the  other  Powers  waiving their  com 
mon pretensions in favour of Russia, then in great need of money—to execute 
a  convention  with  Russia  for  paying  her  by  successive  instalments  the 
twenty-five  millions  of florins  she  owed to  Messrs.  Hope  and Co.  England, 
in  Order  to  cover  the  robbery  she  had  comitted on Holland, of  her  colonies 
at  the  Cape  of  Good  Hope,  Demerara,  Essequibo,  and  Berbice,  became  a 
party  to  that  convention,  and  bound  herself  to  pay  a  certain  proportion  of 
the  subsidies  granted  to  Russia.  This  stipulation became  part  of  the  treaty 
of  Vienna,  but  upon  the  express  condition  "that  the  payment  should  cease 

30 

35 

40 

411 

Karl  Marx 

if the  union between  Holland  and  Belgium were  broken prior to the liquida 
tion  of the  debt." When Belgium  separated itself by revolution from Holland, 
she  of  course  refused  to  pay  her  portion  to Russia.  On the other hand, there 
remained,  Mr.Herries  stated,  "not  the  smallest  iota  of  a  claim  on  the  part 
of  Russia  for  the  continuance  of  debt  by  England."  (House  of  Commons, 
Jan. 26,  1832.) 

Lord Palmerston, however, found it quite natural that,  "atone time Russia 
is paid for  supporting the union of Belgium with Holland,  and that at another 
time  she  is  paid  for  the  separation  of  these  countries."  (House  of  Com 
mons,  July  16th,  1832.) 

5 

10 

He  appealed  in  a  very  tragical  manner  to  the  faithful  observance  of 
treaties—and  above  all,  of  the  treaty  of  Vienna;  and  he  contrived  to  carry 
a new  convention with Russia,  dated  16th November,  1831, in the preamble 
of  which  it  is  expressly  stated  that  it is  contracted  "in consideration of the 
general  arrangement^  of  the  Congress  of  Vienna  which  remain  in  full  15 
force." 

When the  convention relating to  the  Russo-Dutch loan,  had been inserted 
in  the  treaty  of  Vienna,  the  Duke  of  Wellington  exclaimed—"This  is  a 
master-stroke  of  diplomacy  on  the  part of  Lord  Castlereagh; for Russia has 
been  tied  down  to  the  observance  of  the  Vienna  treaty  by  a  pecuniary  20 
obligation." When Russia, therefore, withdrew her observance of the Vienna 
treaty  by  the  Cracow  confiscation,  Mr. Hume  moved  to  stop  any  further 
payment to  Russia from  the  British Treasury. The noble viscount, however, 
thought that  although Russia had  a right to  violate the treaty of Vienna with 
regard  to  Poland,  England  remained  tied  to  the  treaty  with  regard  to  Russia.  25 

But this is not the most extraordinary incident of the noble lord's proceed 
ings. After the Belgian revolution had broken out, and before parliament had 
sanctioned  the  new  loan to  Russia,  the  noble  lord  defrayed the  costs  of the 
Russian war  against Poland,  under  the false  pretext of paying off the old debt 
contracted by  England  in  1815,  although  we  may  state,  on the authority of  30 
the  greatest  English  lawyer,  Sir  E. Sugden,  now  Lord  St. Leonards,  that 
"there  was  not  a single debatable point in that question,  and the government 
had  no  power  whatever  of  paying  a  shilling  of  the  money."  (House  of 
Commons,  Jan. 26,  1832.)  And  on the  authority  of  Sir Robert Peel that  "the 
noble lord was  not warrantable bylaw in advancing the money." (House of  35 
Commons, July  12,  1832.) 

Now  we  understand  why  the  noble  lord  is  reiterating  on  every  occasion 
that  "nothing can be  more  painful to  a man of proper feeling than discussions 
upon  the  subject  of  Poland."

The  great  and  eternal  themes  of  the  noble  viscount's  self-glorification  are 
the  services  he  has  rendered  to  the  cause  of  constitutional  liberty  aU  over 
the  continent.  The  world  owes  him,  indeed,  the  invention  of  the  "con-
stitutional"  kingdoms  of Portugal,  Spain,  and Greece,—three political phan 
toms,  only  to  be  compared  with  the  homunculus  of  Faust's  "Wagner." 
Portugal,  under  the  yoke  of  that  huge  hill of flesh,  Donna Maria da  Gloria, 
backed by  a Coburg,  "must be looked upon as one of the  substantive powers 
of  Europe."  (House  of  Commons,  March  10,  1837.) 

10 

At the very  time the noble viscount uttered these words,  six British ships 
of the line anchored at Lisbon, in order to defend the "substantive" daughter 
of  Don  Pedro  from  the  Portuguese  people,  and  to  help  her  to  destroy  the 
constitution  she  had  sworn  to  defend.  Spain,  at  the  disposition  of  another 
Maria, who,  although a notorious sinner, has never found a Magdalen, "holds 
15  out  to  us  a  fair,  a  flourishing,  and  even  a  formidable  power  among  the 
European  kingdoms."  (Speech  of  Lord  Palmerston,  H.  of  C,  March  10, 
1837.) 

20 

Formidable,  indeed,  to  the  holders  of  Spanish bonds.  The  noble  lord  has 
even his reasons ready for having delivered the native country of the Pericles 
and the Sophocles to the nominal sway of an idiot Bavarian boy. "King Otho 
belongs  to  a  country  where  there  exists  a  free  Constitution."  (H.  of  C, 
August  8,  1832.) 

25 

A free  constitution in Bavaria, the German Bceotia! This passes the licentia 
poetica of  rhetorical  flourish,  the  "legitimate  hopes"  held  out by Spain,  and 
the "substantive" power of Portugal. As to Belgium, all Lord Palmerston did 
for  it  was,  burdening  it  with  a  part  of  the  Dutch  debt,  reducing  it  by  the 
Province of Luxemburg,  and adding to it a Coburg dynasty. As to the  entente 
cordiale  with  France,  waning  from  the  moment  he  pretended  to  give  it  the 
finish by  the  Quadruple  Alliance  of  1834,  we  have  already  seen how  far the 
30  noble  lord  understood  to  manage  it  in the  instance  of Poland,  and we  shall 

hear,  by  and  bye,  what  became  of  it  in  his  hands. 

One  of  those  facts,  hardly  adverted  to  by  contemporaries,  but  broadly 
marking the boundaries  of historical epochs, was the military occupation of 
Constantinople  by  the  Russians,  in  1833. 

35 

The  eternal  dream  of  Russia was  at last realised.  The barbarian from  the 
icy banks  of the  Newa held in his  grasp luxurious Byzantium, and the  sunlit 
shores  of  the  Bosphorus.  The  self-styled  heir  to  the  Greek Emperors  occu 
pied,  however  temporarily,  the  Rome  of  the  East. 

413 

Karl  Marx 

"The  occupation  of  Constantinople  by  Russian  troops  sealed  the  fate  of 
Turkey  as  an  independent  power.  The  fact  of  Russia having  occupied  Con 
stantinople  even  for  the  purpose  (?)  of  saving  it,  was  as  decisive  a blow  to 
Turkish  independence  as  if the  flag  of Russia now waved  on the  Seraglio." 
(Speech  of  Sir  Robert  Peel,  H.  of  C,  March  17,  1834.)

In  consequence  of the  unfortunate  war of  1828-29,  the  Porte  had lost her 
prestige  in  the  eyes  of  her  own  subjects.  As  usual  with  Oriental  empires, 
when the paramount power is weakened,  successful revolts of Pachas broke 
out.  As  early  as  October,  1831,  commenced the  conflict between the Sultan 
and  Mehemet  Ali,  the Pasha of Egypt, who  had  supported the Porte during  10 
the Greek insurrection. In the spring of 1832, Ibrahim Pasha, his son, marched 
his  army into  Syria,  conquered that province, by the Battle of Horns, crossed 
the  Taurus,  annihilated  the  last  Turkish  army  at  the  battle  of  Coniah,  and 
moved on the way to  Stamboul. The Sultan was forced to apply to St. Peters-
burgh,  on Feb. 2,1833. On February 17, the French Admiral Roussin arrived  15 
at  Constantinople,  remonstrated  with  the  Porte  two  days  afterwards,  and 
engaged  for  the  retreat  of  the  Pasha on  certain terms,  including  the  refusal 
of  Russian  assistance;  but,  unassisted  as  he was,  he  was,  of  course,  unable 
to  cope  with  Russia.  "You  have  asked for  me,  and you  shall have  me."  On 
February  20,  a Russian squadron  sailed from  Sebastopol,  and disembarked  20 
a large force of Russian troops on the  shores of the Bosphorus, and laid siege 
to  the  capital.  So  eager  was  Russia  for  the  protection  of  Turkey,  that  a 
Russian officer was  simultaneously  dispatched to the Pashas of Erzerum and 
Trebizond,  to  inform  them  that,  in  the  event  of  Ibrahim's  army  marching 
towards  Erzerum,  both  that  place  and  Trebizond  should  be  immediately  25 
protected by  a Russian army.  At the end of May,  1833, Count Orloff  arrived 
from  St. Petersburgh,  and  intimated  to  the  Sultan  that  he  had brought with 
him  a  little  bit  of  paper,  which  the  Sultan  was  to  subscribe  to,  without the 
concurrence  of  any  minister,  and without the diplomatic agent, at the Porte. 
In this  manner  the  famous  treaty of  Unkiar  Skelessi was brought about and  30 
concluded for  eight years to come.  By virtue  of it the  Porte  entered  into  an 
alliance,  offensive  and  defensive  with  Russia,  resigned  the  right  of  entering 
into  any  new  treaties  with  other  powers,  except  with  the  concurrence  of 
Russia,  and  confirmed  the  former  Russo-Turkish treaties,  especially that of 
Adrianople.  By  a  secret  article,  appended  to  the  treaty,  the  Porte  obliged  35 
herself,  "in  favour  of  the  Imperial  Court  of  Russia,  to  close  the  Straits  of 
the  Dardanelles—viz.,  not  to  allow  any  foreign  man-of-war  to  enter  it under 
any  pretext  whatever." 

Whom  was  the  Czar  indebted  to  for  occupying  Constantinople  by  his 
troops,  and  for  transferring,  by  virtue  of  the  treaty of  Unkiar  Skelessi, the  40 
supreme  seat  of  the  Ottoman  empire,  from  Constantinople  to  S t P e t e r s-

burgh?  To  nobody  else  but  to  the  Right  Honourable  Henry  John  Viscount 
Palmerston,  Baron  Temple,  a  Peer  of  Ireland,  a  Member  of  His  Majesty's 
Most Hon.  Privy Council, Knight of the  Great Cross of the Most Honourable 
Order  of  the  Bath,  a  Member  of  Parliament,  and  His  Majesty's  Principal

The  treaty  of  Unkiar  Skelessi  was  concluded  on  July  8th,  1833.  On  July 
11th,  1833, Mr. H. L. Bulwer moved for the production of papers with respect 
to  the  Turco-Syrian  affairs.  The  noble  lord  opposed  the  motion,  "because 
the  transactions  to  which  the  papers  called  for  referred,  were  incomplete, 
and  the  character  of  the whole transaction would depend upon its termina 
tion.  As  the  results  were  not  yet  known,  the  motion  was  premature."—(H. 
of  C,  July  11,  1833.) 

Accused  by  Mr. Bulwer  of  not  having  interfered  for  the  defence  of  the 
Sultan against  Mehemed Ah,  and not having thus  prevented the  advance  of 
the Russian army, he began that curious system of defence and of confession, 
developed  on  later  occasions,  the  membra  disjecta  of  which  I  shall  now 
gather  together. 

"He  was not prepared to deny, that the latter part of last year an application 
was  made  on  the  part  of  the  Sultan  to  the  country  for  assistance."—(H.  of 

20  C,  July  11,  1833.) 

The  Porte  made  formal  application  for  assistance  in  the  course  of  Au-

gust.-(H.  of  C,  August  24,  1833.) 

No, not in August.  "The request of the Porte for naval assistance had been 

made  in  the  month  of  October,  1832."-(H.  of  C,  August  28,  1833.) 

25 

No,  it  was  not  in  October.  "Its  assistance  was  asked  by  the  Porte  in 

November  1832."-(H.  of  C,  March  17,  1834.) 

30 

The  noble  lord  is  as uncertain of the  day when the Porte implored his aid, 
as  Falstaff  was  of  the  number  of rogues  in buckram  suits,  who came  at his 
back,  in  Kendal  green.  He  is  not prepared,  however,  to deny that the  armed 
assistance  offered  by  Russia  was  rejected  by  the  Porte,  and  that  he  was 
applied to. He refused to comply with her demands. The Porte did again apply 
to  the  noble  lord.  First  she  sent  M. Maurojeni  to  London;  then  she  sent 
Nehmik  Pasha,  who  entreated  the  assistance  of  a  naval  squadron  on  the 
condition  of  the  Sultan undertaking to defray all the expenses of that  squad-
ron,  and  promising  in  future  requital  for  that  succour,  the  grant  of  new 
commercial privileges,  and advantages to  British  subjects  in Turkey.  So sure 
was  Russia  of  the  noble  lord's  refusal,  that  she  joined  the  Turkish  Envoy 
in  praying  his  lordship  for  the  affording  of  the  demanded  succour.  He  tells 
us  himself,  "It  was  but  justice  that he  should  state,  that  so  far  from  Russia 
40 having expressed any jealousy as to this government granting this assistance, 
the  Russian Ambassador  officially  communicated  to  him,  while  the  request 

35 

415 

Karl  Marx 

was  still under the consideration, that he had learned that such an application 
had  been  made,  and  that,  from  the  interest  taken  by  Russia  in  the  main 
tenance  and  preservation  of the Turkish empire, it would afford  satisfaction 
if  ministers  could  find  themselves  able  to  comply  with  that  request."—(H. 
of  C,  August 28,  1833.) 

5 

The  noble lord remained, however, inexorable to the demands of the Porte, 
although backed  by  disinterested  Russia herself.  Then,  of  course,  the  Porte 
knew  what  she  was  about.  She  understood  that  she  was  doomed  to  make 
the  wolf  shepherd.  Still  she  hesitated,  and  did not accept the Russian assist 
ance  till  three  months  later.  "Great  Britain,"  says  the  noble  lord,  "never  10 
complained of Russia granting that assistance, but, on the contrary, was glad 
that Turkey had been  able  to  obtain  effectual  relief  from  any quarter."—(H. 
of  C,  March  17,  1834.) 

At  whatever  epoch the  Porte  may  have  implored  the  aid  of  Lord  Palmer 
ston,  he  cannot but  own,  "No  doubt  if  England  had  thought fit to  interfere, 
the progress  of the invading army would  have been  stopped,  and the Russian 
troops  would not have  been called in."-(H.  of C, July  11,  1833.) 

15 

Why  then  did he  not  "think fit" to  interfere  and  to  keep  the Russians  out? 
First he pleads  want of time.  According to his own statement the conflict 
between  the  Porte  and  Mehemed  Ali  arose  as early as  October  1831, while  20 
the  decisive  battle  of  Koniah  was  not fought till December 21,1832.  Could 
he  find  no  time  during  all  this  period?  A  great  battle  was  won  by  Ibrahim 
Pasha in  July  1832,  and  again  he  could  find no  time  from  July to December. 
But  he  was  all  that  time  waiting  for  a formal application,  which,  according 
to  his  last  version,  was  not  made till the 3rd of November.  "Was  he then,"  25 
asks  Sir  Robert  Peel,  "so  ignorant  of  what  was  passing  in the  Levant,  that 
he must wait for a formal application?"  (H.  of  C,  March  17,1834.) And from 
November,  when  the  formal  application  was  made,  to  the  latter  part  of 
February,  there  elapsed  again  four  long  months,  and  Russia  did  not  arrive 
until  February 20,  1833.  Why  did  not  he? 
But  he  has  better  reasons  in  reserve. 
The  Pasha  of  Egypt  was  but  a rebellious  subject,  and the  Sultan was  the 
Suzerain.  "As  it  was  a  war  against  the  sovereign  by  a  subject,  and  that 
sovereign  was  in  alliance  with  the  King  of  England,  it  would  have  been 
inconsistent with good faith to have had  any communication with the Pasha." 
(H.  of  C,  August 28,1833.)  E t i q u e t te  prevented the noble lord from  stop 
ping  Ibrahim's  armies.  Etiquette  forbade  him  giving  instructions  to  his 
Consul  at  Alexandria  to  use  his  influence  with  Mehemed  Ali.  Like  the 
Spanish  Grandee,  the  noble  lord  would  rather  let  the  Queen  burn  to  ashes 
than  infringe  on  etiquette  and  interfere with the  petticoats.  Perchance  it  so  40 
appears  that  the  noble  lord  had  already  in  1832,  accredited  consuls  and 

35 

30 

416 

Lord  Palmerston.  Fourth  Article 

diplomatic  agents  to  the  "subject"  of the  Sultan without the  consent of the 
Sultan,  that  he  entered into  treaties  with  Mehemed altering existing regula 
tions  and arrangements  touching matters of trade and revenue  and establish 
ing other  ones  in their rooms; that he did so without the consent of the Porte 
beforehand,  or  caring  for  its  approbation  afterwards—(H.  of  C,  February 
23,  1848.) 

5 

Accordingly, we are told by Earl Grey, the then chief of the noble viscount 
that  "They had at the moment extensive commercial relations with Mehemed 
Ali which it would not have been their interest to disturb."—(House of Lords, 

10  February 4,  1834.) 

What  commercial  relations  with  the  "rebellious  subject." 
But the noble viscount's fleets were occupied in the Douro, and the Tagus, 
and blockading  the  Scheldt, and  doing the  service of the midwife at the birth 
of  the  constitutional  empires  of  Portugal,  Spain,  and  Belgium,  and  he was, 
therefore,  not  in  a  situation to  spare  one  single  ship.—(H.  of  C.,  March  17, 
1834,  and  House  of  Lords,  February  4,  1834.) 

15 

But what the  Sultan insisted  on was  precisely  naval  assistance.  For  argu 
ment's  sake  we  will  grant  the  noble  lord  to  have been unable to  dispose  of 
one  single  vessel.  But  there  are  great authorities  assuring us  that what was 
20 wanted was not a single vessel, but only a single word on the part of the noble 
lord.  There  is  Admiral  Codrington,  the  destroyer  of  the  Turkish  fleet  at 
Navarino.  "Mehemed  Ah,"  he  states,  "had  of  old  felt  the  strength  of  our 
representations  on the  subject  of  the  evacuation of  the  Morea.  He had  then 
received  orders  from  the  Porte  to  resist  all  applications  to  induce  him  to 
evacuate  it  at  the  risk of  his  head,  and he  did resist accordingly, but at last 
prudently  yielded  and  evacuated  the  Morea."—(H.  of  C,  April  20,1836.) 

25 

There  is  the  Duke  of Wellington.  "If,  in the  session of  1832 or  1833, they 
had plainly told  Mehemed Ali, that he  should not carry on his contest in Syria 
and  Asia  Minor,  they  would  have  put an end  to  the  war without the  risk of 
allowing  the  Emperor  of  Russia  to  send  a  fleet  and  an  army  to  Con 
stantinople."—(House  of  Lords,  Feb. 4,  1834.) 

30 

But  there  are  better  authorities.  There  is  the  noble  lord  himself.  "Al 
though,"  he  says,  "his  Majesty's  government  did  not  comply  with  the  de 
mand  of  the  Sultan for naval assistance, yet the moral assistance of England 
35  was  afforded;  and  the  communications  made  by the  British government to 
the  Pasha  of  Egypt,  and  to  forahim  Pasha,  commanding in Asia Minor,  did 
materially  contribute  to  bring  about that arrangement (of Kutayah) between 
the  Sultan  and  the  Pasha,  by  which  that  war  was  terminated.'"—(H.  of  C, 
March  17,1834.)  There is  Lord Derby,  then  Lord  Stanley,  and  a member of 
the  Palmerston  Cabinet,  who  "boldly asserts that what stopped the progress 
of Mehemet AU, was the distinct declaration of France and England that they 

40 

417 

Karl  Marx 

would  not  permit  the  occupation  of  Constantinople  by  his  troops."—(H.  of 
C,  March  17,  1834). 

Thus  then,  according  to  Lord  Derby  and  to  Lord  Palmerston  himself,  it 
was  not  the  Russian  squadron  and  army  at  Constantinople,  but  it  was  a 
distinct declaration on  the  part of the British consular agent at Alexandria, 
that  stopped  Ibrahim's  victorious  march upon  Constantinople,  and  brought 
about  the  arrangement  of  Kutayah,  by  virtue  of  which  Mehemed  Ali  ob 
tained,  besides  Egypt,  the  Pashalik  of  Syria,  of  Adana  and  other  places, 
added  as an appendage. But the noble lord thought fit not to allow his consul 
at Alexandria to make this distinct declaration till after the Turkish army was 
annihilated,  Constantinople  overrun  by  the  Cossack,  the  treaty  of  Unkiar 
Skelessi  signed  by  the  Sultan,  and  pocketed  by  the  Czar.

If  want  of  time  and  want  of  fleets,  forbade  the  noble  lord  to  assist  the 
Sultan,  and  a  superfluity  of  etiquette  to  check  the  Pasha,  did  he  at  least 
employ  his  ambassador  at  Constantinople  to  guard  against  excessive  in-  15 
fluence  on the  part  of  Russia,  and to  keep  her  influence  confined to narrow 
bounds?  Quite  the  contrary.  In order  not to  clog the  movements  of Russia, 
the noble lord took good care to have no  ambassador at all at Constantinople 
during  the  most  fatal  period  of  the  crisis. 

"If ever there was a country in which the weight and station of an ambassa-  20 

dor  were  useful—or  a  period  in  which  that  weight  and  station  might  be 
advantageously  exerted—that  country  was  Turkey,  during  the  six  months 
before the  8th of July."-(Speech of Lord  Mahon,  H.  of  C,  April 20,1836.) 

Lord  Palmerston  tells  us,  that  the  British  Ambassador,  Sir  Stratford 

Canning,  left Constantinople in  September,  1832—that Lord Ponsonby, then  25 
at  Naples,  was  appointed  in  his  place  in  November  and  that  "difficulties 
experienced  in  making  the  necessary  arrangements  for  his  conveyance,"— 
although  a man-of-war was  in waiting for  him—"and  the  unfavourable  state 
of  the  weather,  did  prevent  his  getting  to  Constantinople,  until  the  end  of 
May,  1833."-(H.  of  C,  March  17,  1834.) 

30 

The  Russian was  not yet in,  and  Lord Ponsonby was accordingly ordered 

to  require  seven  months  for  sailing  from  Naples  to  Constantinople. 

But  why  should  the  noble  lord  prevent  the  Russians  from  occupying 
Constantinople?  "He  for  his  part  had  great  doubts  that  any  intention  to 
partition  the  Ottoman  Empire  at all entered  into  the  policy  of  the  Russian  35 
government."-(H.  of  C,  July  11,  1833.) 

Certainly  not.  Russia  wants  not  to  partition  the  empire  but  to  keep  the 
whole  of  it.  Besides  the  security  Lord  Palmerston  possessed  in  this  doubt 
he  had  another  security  "in  the  doubt,  whether  it  enters  into  the  policy  of 
Russia  at present to  accomplish  the  object,"  and  a third  "security"  in  this  40 
third  doubt  "whether  the  Russian  nation  (just tliink  of  a Russian  nationt) 

418 

Lord  Palmerston.  Fourth  Article.  Fifth  Article 

5 

would be prepared for that transference of power, of residence, and authority 
to  the  southern provinces which would be the necessary consequence of the 
conquest  by  Russia  of  Constantinople."—(H.  of  C,  July  11,  1833.) 

Besides  these  negative  arguments  the  noble lord  had  an affirmative  one: 
"if they had  quietly beheld the temporary  occupation  of the Turkish capital 
by the forces  of Russia, it was because they had full confidence in the honour 
and  good  faith  of  Russia.  . ..  The Russian government in granting its  aid to 
the  Sultan  had  pledged  its  honour,  and  in  that  pledge  he reposed  the  most 
implicit  confidence."-(H.  of  C,  July  11,  1833.) 

10 

15 

So  inaccessible,  indestructible,  integral,  imperishable,  inexpugnable,  in 
calculable, incommensurable, and irremediable; so boundless, dauntless, and 
matchless was the noble lord's  confidence, that still on March 17,1834, when 
the  treaty  of  Unkiar  Skelessi  had become  a fait accompli,  he  went  on  de 
claring  that,  "in  their  confidence  ministers  were  not  deceived."  Not  his  is 
the fault if nature has developed his protuberance of confidence to altogether 
anomalous  dimensions. 

The  People's  Paper. 
Nr. 81,  19. November  1853 

F i f th  A r t i c l e. 

The  contents  of  the  treaty  of Unkiar Skelessi were published by the  "Morn 
ing  Herald,"  on  Aug. 21,  1833.  On  August  24,  Sir  Robert Inglis asked Lord 
20  Palmerston  in  the  House  of  Commons,  "whether  there  really  had  been 
concluded  a  treaty,  offensive  and  defensive,  between  Russia  and  Turkey? 
He  hoped  that  the  noble lord would be prepared, before  the prorogation of 
parliament  to  lay  before the house, not only the treaties that had been  made, 
but  all  communications  connected  with  the  formation  of  those  treaties 
25  between  Turkey  and  Russia."  Lord  Palmerston  answered  that  "when they 
were  sure that such a treaty as that alluded to  really did exist; and when they 
were in possession of that treaty, it would  then be for them to determine what 
was  the  course  of  policy  they  ought  to  pursue  . ..  It  could  be  no  blame  to 
him  if  the  newspapers  were  sometimes  beforehand  with  the  government." 
(House  of  Commons, August 24,  1833.) 

30 

Seven months  afterwards  he  assures  that "it was perfectly impossible that 
the  treaty  of  Unkiar  Skelessi,  not  to  be  ratified  at  Constantinople  until the 
month of  September,  should  have  been officially known to  him in August." 
(H.  of  C,  March  17,  1834.) 

35 

He  did  know  the  treaty,  but  not  officially.  "The  British government was 
surprised  to  find  that when the  Russian troops  quitted  the  Bosphorus,  they 

419 

Karl  Marx 

carried  that  treaty  with  them."  (Speech  of  Lord  Palmerston,  H.  of  C, 
March  1,  1848.)  Yea,  the  noble  lord  was  in  possession  of  the  treaty  before 
it  had  been  concluded. 

"No  sooner had the Porte received it (viz., the draft of the treaty of Unkiar 
Skelessi),  than  the  treaty  was  communicated  by  them  to  the  British  Em- 
bassy  at  Constantinople,  with the  prayer for  our  protection  against Ibrahim 
Pasha,  and against Nicholas.  The application was rejected—but that was  not 
all.  With  an  atrocious  perfidiousness,  the  fact  was  made  known  to  the 
Russian  Minister.  Next  day the  very  copy  of  the  treaty  which the Porte had 
lodged  with  the  British  Embassy,  was  returned  to  the  Porte  by the  Russian 
Ambassador,  who  ironically  advised  the  Porte—'to  choose  better  another 
time  its  confidants'."  (H.  of  C,  Feb. 8,  1848.)

But the  noble viscount had obtained  aU he cared for. He was interrogated 
with  respect to  the  treaty  of Unkiar Skelessi,  of whose existence he was  not 
sure on August 24,1833. On August 29, parliament was prorogued, receiving  15 
from  the  throne  the  consolatory  assertion  that  "the  hostilities  which  had 
disturbed  the  peace  of  Turkey  had  been  terminated,  and  they  might  be 
assured  that  the  king's  attention  would  be  carefully  directed  to  any  events 
which  might  affect  the  present  state  or  the  future  independence  of  that 
empire." 

20 

Here  we  have  the  key to  the  famous  Russian treaties of July.  In July they 
are  concluded;  in  August,  something  about  them  is  transpiring through the 
public press. Lord Palmerston is interrogated in the Commons. He, of course, 
is  aware  of nothing.  Parliament is  prorogued—and,  when it reassembles, the 
treaty  has  grown old,  or,  as  in  1841,  has  already  been executed, in  spite of  25 
public  opinion. 

Parliament  was  prorogued  on  August  29,  1833,  and  it  reassembled  on 
Feb.  5,1834.  The interval between the prorogation and its reassembling was 
marked  by  two  incidents  intimately  interwoven with  each other.  On the one 
hand,  the  united  French  and  English  fleets  proceeded to  the  Dardanelles,  30 
displayed  there  the  tricolour,  and  the  national  flag  of  England,  sailed  then-
way  to  Smyrna,  and  returned  from  thence  to  Malta.  On  the  other  hand,  a 
new treaty was concluded between the Porte and Russia, on January 29,1834, 
the treaty  of  St. Petersburgh.  This  treaty  was  hardly  signed when the united 
fleet was withdrawn. 

35 

This  combined  manœuvre  was  intended  to  stultify  the  British people  and 
Europe into the belief that the hostile  demonstration on the Turkish seas and 
coasts,  directed  against the Porte, for having concluded the treaty of Unkiar 
Skelessi,  had  enforced  upon  Russia the  new treaty  of  St. Petersburgh.  This 
treaty,  by  promising  the  evacuation of  the  Principalities,  and  reducing  the  40 
Turkish payments  to one-third of the  stipulated amount,  apparently relieved 

420 

Lord  Palmerston.  Fifth  Article 

the  Porte  from  some  engagements  enforced  on  her  by  the  treaty  of  Adria 
nople.  In  all  other  instances  it was  a ratification of the treaty of Adrianople, 
not at all relating to the treaty of Unkiar Skelessi, nor dropping a word about 
the  passage  of  the  Dardanelles.  On  the  contrary, the  alleviations it granted 
to  Turkey,  were  the  purchase-money  for  the  exclusion  of  Europe,  by  the 
treaty  of  Unkiar  Skelessi,  from  the  Dardanelles. 

"The  very  day on which the  demonstration (of the British fleet) was being 
made,  an  assurance  was  given by the  noble lord to the Russian Ambassador 
at this court, that this combined movement of the squadrons was not intended 
in  any  sense  hostile  to  Russia,  nor  to  be  taken  as  a hostile  demonstration 
against her ; but, that in fact, it meant nothing at all. I say this on the authority 
of  Lord  Ponsonby,  the  noble  lord's  own  colleague,  the  Ambassador,  at 
Constantinople."-(Speech  of  Mr. Anstey,  H.  of  C,  Feb. 23,  1848.) 

5 

10 

After  the  treaty  of  St. Petersburgh  had  been  ratified,  the  noble  lord  ex-
Í5  pressed  his  satisfaction  with  the  moderation  of  the terms  imposed by Rus 

sia. 

When  Parliament  had  re-assembled,  there  appeared  in  the  "Globe,"  the 
organ  of  the  Foreign  Office,  a  paragraph  stating that  "The treaty  of  St. Pe 
tersburgh  was  a  proof  either  of  the  moderation  or  good  sense  of  Russia,  or 
20  of  the  influence  which  the  union  of  England  and  France,  and the firm and 
concerted  language  of  those  two  powers  had  acquired  in  the  councils  of 
St. Petersburgh."-("Globe,"  Feb. 24,  1834.) 

Thus public attention was to be diverted from the treaty of Unkiar Skelessi, 
and  the  animosity  it  had  aroused  in  Europe  against  Russia,  to  be  soothed 

25  down. 

Artful  as  the  dodging  was,  it would not do.  On March  17,1834,  Mr. Sheil 
brought  in  a  motion  for  "the  copies  of  the  treaties  between  Turkey  and 
Russia,  and  of  any  correspondence  between  the  English,  Russian,  and 
Turkish Governments, respecting those treaties, to be laid before the house." 
30  The  noble  lord  resisted  this  resolution  to  his  utmost,  and  succeeded  in 
baffling  it by  assuring the  house  that  "peace  could be preserved only by the 
house  reposing  confidence  in  the  government,"  and  refusing  to  accede  to 
the  motion.  So  grossly  inapt were  the reasons he  stated to prevent him from 
producing  the  papers,  that  Sir  Robert  Peel  called  him, in his parliamentary 
language  "a very unconclusive reasoner,"  and his own Colonel Evans could 
not help exclaiming:  "The  speech of the noble lord appeared to him the most 
unsatisfactory  he  had  ever  heard  from  him." 

35 

Lord  Palmerston  strived  to  convince  the  house  that,  according  to  the 
assurances  of  Russia,  the  treaty  of  Unkiar  Skelessi was  to  be  looked  upon 
"as one of reciprocity," that reciprocity being, that if the Dardanelles should 
be  closed  against  England  in the  event  of war  they  should  be closed against 

40 

421 

1 

Karl  Marx 

Russia  also.  The  statement  was  altogether  false,  but  if  true,  this  certainly 
would  have  been  Irish  reciprocity,  for  it  was  all  on  one  side.  To  cross  the 
Dardanelles  is  for  Russia  not  the  means  to  get  at the  Black  Sea, but on the 
contrary,  to  leave  it. 

5 

So far from refuting Mr. Sheil's  statement,  "the consequence of the treaty 
of  Unkiar  Skelessi  was  the  same  as  if  the  Porte  surrendered  to  Russia  the 
possession  of  the  Dardanelles,"  Lord  Palmerston  owned  that  the  treaty 
closed  the  Dardanelles  to  British  men-of  war,  and that  "under  its  provision 
even  merchant  vessels  might,  in  effect,  be  practically  excluded  from  the 
Black  Sea,"  in  the  case  of  a  war  between  England  and  Russia.  But if  the  10 
government  acted  with  a  "temper,"  if  it  "showed  no  unnecessary distrust," 
that is to  say,  if  it  quietly  submitted to  all further  encroachments  of Russia, 
he  was  "inclined  to  think  that  the  case  might  not arise  in which that treaty 
would  be  called  into  operation;  and  that  therefore  it  would,  in  practice, 
remain  a dead letter."-(H.  of  C,  March  17,  1834.) 

15 

Besides,  "the  assurance  and explanations" which the  British government 
had  received  from  the  contracting  parties  to  that  treaty  greatly  tended  to 
remove  its objections to  it. Thus  then it was  not the  articles  of the  treaty of 
Unkiar  Skelessi,  but  the  assurances  Russia gave  with  respect  to  them,  not 
the  acts  of Russia, but her language, he had in his opinion to look upon. Yet,  20 
as  on  the  same  day  his  attention  was  called  to  the  protest  of  the  French 
Chargé d'Affaires, M. Lagrené, against the treaty of Unkiar Skelessi, and the 
offensive  and contumelious  language  of Count Nessehode,  answering in the 
"St.  Petersburgh  Gazette"  that  "the  Emperor  of Russia would  act as  if the 
declaration contained in the  note of M. Lagrené had no existence," then the  25 
noble  lord,  eating up  his  own words, propounded  the  opposite  doctrine that 
"it  was  on  all  occasions  the  duty of  the  English government  to  look rather 
to  the  acts  of  Foreign  power,  than  to  the  language  which  the  power  might 
hold  on  any particular  subject or  occasion."  One moment he appealed from 
the  acts  of  Russia  to  her  language,  and  the  other  from  her  language  to  her  30 
acts.  Still in  1837  he  assured that "the treaty of Unkiar Skelessi was a treaty 
between  two  independent  powers."—(H.  of  C,  December  14,  1837.) 

Ten  years  later,  the  treaty  having  long  since  elapsed,  and  the  noble  lord 
being just  about  acting  the  play  of  the  Truly  English Minister and the  "civis 
romanus  sum, "he  told the house plainly,  "the  treaty of  Unkiar  Skelessi was 
no  doubt  to  a  certain  degree  forced  upon  Turkey  by  Count  Orloff,  the 
Russian  Envoy,  under  circumstances"—created  by  the  noble  lord  him 
self—"which  rendered  it  difficult  for  Turkey  to  refuse  acceding  to  i t . . ..  It 
gave  practically  to  the  Russian  government  a  power  of  interference  and 
dictation  in  Turkey,  not  consistent  with  the  independence  of  that  state."  40 
(H.  of  C,  March  1,  1848.)

Lord  Palmerston.  Fifth  Article 

During the whole course of the debates about the treaty of Unkiar Skelessi, 
the  noble  lord,  like  the  clown  in  the  comedy,  had  an  answer  of  most  mon 
strous  size,  that  must  fit  all  demands  and  serve  all  questions—the  Anglo-
French alliance.  When his connivance with Russia was pointed at, in sneers, 
5  he  gravely  retorted:  "If  the  present  relations  established  between  this 
country  and  France,  were pointed at in these  sneers, he would only say, that 
he  should look with feelings of pride  and  satisfaction at the part he had acted 
in  bringing  about  that  good  understanding."-{H.  of  C,  July  11,  1833.) 

When the production of the papers relating to the treaty of Unkiar Skelessi 
10  was  demanded,  he  answered  that  "England and France had now cemented 
a  friendship  which  had  only  grown stronger."—(H.  of C,  March  17,1834.) 

15 

"He  could  but  remark,"  exclaimed  Sir  Robert  Peel,  "that  whenever  the 
noble lord was thrown into  a difficulty as  to  any part of our European policy, 
he at once formed a ready means of escape, by congratulating the house upon 
the  close  alliance  between  this  country  and  France."  Simultaneously  the 
noble  lord  was  strengthening  the  suspicions  of  his  Tory  opponents  that 
"England  was  compelled  to  connive  at  an  aggression  upon  Turkey,  which 
France had directly encouraged." 

20 

At  that  time,  then,  the  ostensible  alliance  with  France  was  to  cover  the 
secret infeoffment to  Russia, as, in 1840, the clamorous rupture with France 
was  to  cover  the  official  alliance  with  Russia. 

30 

While  the  noble  lord  fatigued  the  world  with ponderous  folios  of printed 
negotiations  on the  affairs  of  the  constitutional  empire  of  Belgium and with 
ample  explanations, verbal and documentary, with regard to the "substantive 
25  power"  of Portugal; to this  moment it has  proved quite impossible to wrest 
out  of  him  any  document  whatever  relating  to  the  first  Syro-Turkish  war, 
and  to  the  treaty of Unkiar Skelessi.  When the production of the papers was 
first  demanded,  on  July  11th,  1833,  "The motion was premature, the  trans 
actions  incomplete,  and the  results  not  yet  known."  On August 24th,  1833, 
"the  treaty  was  not  officially  signed,  and  he  was  not  in possession  of  it." 
On  March  17th,  1834,  "Communications  were  still  carrying  on  . ..  the  dis 
cussions,  if  he  might  so  call  them,  were  not  yet  completed."  Still,  in  1848, 
when  Mr. Anstey  told  him  that,  in  asking  for  the  papers,  he  did ask for the 
proof  of  the  noble  lord's  collusion  with  the  Czar,  the  chivalrous  minister 
35  preferred  killing  time  by  a  five  hours  speech  to  killing  suspicion  by  self-
speaking  documents.  Notwithstanding  all  this, he  had the  cynic impudence 
to  assure  Mr. T. Attwood,  on  December  14th,  1837,  that  "the  papers  con 
nected with that treaty,  viz.,  the  treaty of  Unkiar  Skelessi, were  laid before 
the  house  three  years  ago,"  that  is  to  say  in  1834,  when  "peace  could  be 
40  preserved only" by withholding the papers from the house. On the same day 
he  told  Mr. Attwood  that  "this treaty was  a matter which had gone by, that 

423 

Karl  Marx 

it  was  entered  into  for  a limited  period,  and  that  period having expired,  its 
introduction  by  the  honourable  member  was  wholly  unnecessary  and  un 
called  for."  According  to  the  original  stipulation,  the  treaty  of  Unkiar 
Skelessi was to  expire  on July 8th,  1841.  Lord Palmerston tells Mr. Attwood 
that it had  already  expired on December  14th,  1837. 

"What trick,  what devise,  what  starting  hole,  can'st thou now find to  hide 
thee  from this  open  and  apparent  shame?  Come  let's  hear,  Jack—what trick 
hast  thou  now?"

There is no such word in the Russian vocabulary as "honour." As to the thing  10 
itself,  it  is  considered  to  be  a  French  delusion. 

"Schto takoi honneur? Eto Fransusski chimere," is aRussian proverb. For 
the invention of  Russian honour the world is exclusively indebted to my Lord 
Palmerston,  who,  during  a  quarter  of  a  century,  used,  at  every  critical 
moment, to pledge himself, in the most emphatical manner, for the "honour" 15 
of  the  Czar.  So  he  did at the  close of the  Session of  1853, as  at the  close  of 
the  Session  of  1833. 

Now  it happens  that the  noble  lord, while he expressed "his most implicit 
confidence  in  the  honour  and  good  faith"  of  the  Czar,  had  just  got  into 
possession of  documents,  concealed from  the  rest of  the world, and leaving  20 
no  doubt,  if  any  existed,  about the nature of Russian honour and good faith. 
He  had  not  even  to  scratch  the  Muscovite  in  order  to  find  the  Tartar.  He 
had caught the Tartar in his naked hideousness.  He found himself possessed 
of  the  self-confessions  of  the  leading  Russian  ministers  and  diplomatists, 
throwing off their cloaks, clapping out their most secret thoughts, unfolding,  25 
without constraint, their plans of conquest and subjugation, scornfully railing 
at  the  imbecile  credulity  of  European  Courts  and  Ministers,  mocking  the 
Villèles, the Metternichs, the Aberdeens, the Cannings, and the Wellingtons ; 
and devising, in common, with the savage cynicism of the barbarian, mitigat 
ed  by  the  cruel  irony  of  the  courtier,  how  to  sow  distrust  against  England  30 
at Paris,  and  against  Austria at  London, and against London at Vienna, how 
to  set them  all  by  the  ears,  and  how  to  make  all  of  them  the  mere tools of 
Russia. 

At  the  time  of  the  insurrection  of  Warsaw,  the  vice-royal  archives  kept

Lord  Palmerston,  Sixth  Article 

this  century  down to  1830,  fell into the  hands  of the victorious Poles. Polish 
Refugees  brought  these  papers  over  first  to  France,  and,  at  a  later  period, 
Count Zamoy ski, the nephew of Prince Czartoryski, placed them in the hands 
of  Lord  Palmerston,  who  buried  them  in  Christian  oblivion.  With  these 
5  papers in his pockets, the  noble  viscount was the  more eager to  proclaim in 
the  British  Senate  and  to  the  world  "his  most  implicit  confidence  in  the 
honour  and  good  faith  of  the  Emperor  of  Russia." 

Not  the  fault  of  the  noble  viscount,  that  those  startling  papers  were  at 
length  published  at  the  end  of  1835,  through  the  famous  "Portfolio."  King 
10  William  IV., whatever he was in other respects, was  a most decided enemy 
of  Russia.  His  private  secretary,  Sir  Herbert  Taylor,  was  intimately  con 
nected with David Urquhart,  introducing this  gentleman to  the  King himself, 
and  from that moment royalty  was  conspiring with those two friends  against 
the  policy  of  the  "truly  English"  minister. 

15 

20 

25 

"William  TV*,  ordered  the  above-mentioned  papers  to  be  given up by the 
noble  lord.  They  were  given up and examined at the time at Windsor Castle, 
and  it  was  found  desirable  to  print  and  publish  them.  In  spite  of  the  great 
opposition  of  the  noble  lord,  the  king  compelled  him  to  lend  the  authority 
of  the  Foreign  Office  to  their  publication,  so  that  the  editor,  who  took the 
charge  of revising them for the press, published not a single word which had 
not  the  signature  or  initials  attached.  I,  myself,  have  seen  the  noble  lord's 
initial attached to one of those documents, although the noble lord has denied 
these  facts.  Lord  Palmerston  was  compelled  to  place  the  documents  in the 
hands  of  Mr. Urquhart  for  publication.  Mr. Urquhart  was the real  editor  of 
the 'Portfolio'." (Speech of Mr. Anstey, House of Commons, February 23rd, 
1848.) 

After  the  death  of  the  king,  Lord  Palmerston  refused  to  pay  the  printer 
of  the  "Portfolio,"  and disclaimed,  publicly  and  solemnly,  all connexion on 
the  part  of  the  Foreign  Office,  and  induced,  in  what manner  is  not known, 
30 Mr. Backhouse, his under secretary, to set his name to those denials. We read 
in  the  "Times"  of  January,  26th,  1839:—"It is  not for us  to  understand how 
Lord  Palmerston may feel, but we are  sure there is  no  misapprehending how 
any  other person  in  the  station  of  a  gentleman,  and  in  the  position  of  a 
minister, would feel, after the notoriety given to the correspondence between 
35  Mr. Urquhart,  whom Lord Palmerston dismissed from office, and Mr. Back 
house,  whom  the  noble  viscount  has  retained  in  office,  by  the  'Times'  of 
yesterday.  There  never was  a fact apparently better established through this 
correspondence  than  that  the  series  of  official  documents  contained in the 
well-known  publication,  called  the  'Portfolio,'  were  printed  and  circulated 
40  by  Lord  Palmerston's  authority,  and that his lordship is  responsible for the 
publication  of  them,  both  as  a  statesman  to  the  political  world  here  and 

425 

Karl  Marx 

abroad,  and  as  an employer of the printers and publishers, for the pecuniary 
charge  accompanying  it." 

In  consequence  of  her financial  distress,  resulting from the exhaustion of 
the  treasury  by  the  unfortunate  war  of  1828—29,  and  the  debt  to  Russia 
stipulated  by  the  treaty  of  Adrianople,  Turkey  found  herself  compelled  to 
extend that obnoxious  system  of  monopolies  by which the  sale of almost all 
articles  was  granted only to  those who  had paid government licenses.  Thus 
a few usurers  were enabled to seize upon the entire commerce of the country. 
Mr. Urquhart  proposed  to  King  William  TV.,  a  commercial  treaty  to  be 
concluded with the Sultan, which treaty, while guaranteeing great advantages 10 
to  British  commerce,  intended  at  the  same  time  to  develop  the  productive 
resources  of Turkey,  to restore her Exchequer to health and thus to emanci 
pate  her  from  the  Russian  yoke.  The  curious  history  of  this  treaty  cannot 
be  better  related  than  in  the  words  of  Mr. Anstey: 

5 

15 

"The whole of the contest between Lord Palmerston on the one hand, and 
Mr. Urquhart on the  other, was  directed to this treaty  of commerce.  On the 
third  of  October,  1835, Mr. Urquhart obtained his  commission as  Secretary 
of  Legation  at  Constantinople,  given  him  for  the  one  purpose  of  securing 
the  adoption  there  of  the  Turkish  commercial  treaty.  He  delayed  his  de 
parture however till June or July,  1836.  Lord Palmerston pressed him to go.  20 
The  applications  to  him  urging his departure were numerous, but his answer 
invariably was:  I will not go until I have this  commercial treaty  settled with 
the  Board  of  Trade  and  the  Foreign  Office;  and  then  I  will  accompany  it, 
and  procure  its  acceptance  at  the  Porte  . ..  Finally,  Lord  Palmerston  gave 
his  approbation  to  the  treaty,  and  it was  forwarded  to  Lord Ponsonby, the  25 
Ambassador  at  Constantinople.  (In  the  meantime  the  latter  had  been  in 
structed by Lord Palmerston to take the negotiations entirely out of the hands 
of  Mr. Urquhart into his  own,  contrary  to  the  engagement  entered into with 
Mr. Urquhart.) As soon as the removal of Mr. Urquhart from Constantinople 
had  been  effected  through  the  intrigues  of  the  noble  lord,  the  treaty  was  30 
immediately  thrown  overboard.  Two  years  later  the  noble  lord resumed it, 
giving  Mr. Urquhart  before  Parliament, the  compliment  of being the  author 
of  it,  and  disclaiming  for  himself  all  merits  in  it.  But  the  noble  lord  had 
destroyed  the  treaty,  falsified  it  in  every  part,  and  converted  it  to  the  ruin 
of  commerce.  The  original  treaty  of  Mr. Urquhart  placed  the  subjects  of  35 
Great  Britain in Turkey, upon the  footing  of the most favoured nation—viz., 
the  Russians.  As  altered by Lord Palmerston, it placed the  subjects of Great 
Britain  upon  the  footing  of  the  taxed  and  oppressed  subjects  of  the  Porte. 
Mr. Urquhart's  treaty stipulated for the removal of all transit duties, monopo 
lies,  taxes,  and duties  of whatever character,  other than those  stipulated by  40 
the  treaty  itself.  As  falsified  by  Lord  Palmerston,  it  contained  a  clause, 

426 

Lord  Palmerston.  Sixth  Article 

declaring  the  perfect right  of  the  Sublime  Porte  to  impose  whatever  regula 
tions  and  restrictions  it  pleased,  with  regard  to  commerce.  Mr. Urquhart's 
treaty  left  importation  subject  only  to  the  old  duty  of  three  shillings;  that 
of  the  noble  lord  raised  the  duty  from  three  shillings  to  five  shillings. 
5  Mr. Urquhart's  treaty  stipulated for  an  ad valorem  duty  in this  manner, that 
if  any article of  commerce was  so  exclusively the  production of Turkey,  as 
to  insure  it  a  ready  sale,  at the prices usually received under the  monopoly 
in  foreign ports,  then the  export  duty  to  be  assessed  by  two  commissioners 
appointed  on the part of England  and Turkey,  might be  a high  one,  so  as  to 
10  be  remunerative  and  productive  of  revenue,  but  that,  in  the  case  of  com 
modities  produced  elsewhere  than  in  Turkey,  and  not  being  of  sufficient 
value  in  foreign  ports  to  bear  a high  duty,  a lower  duty  should  be  assessed. 
Lord  Palmerston's  treaty  stipulated  a fixed  duty  of twelve  shillings  ad valo 
rem  upon  every  article  whether  it  would  bear  the  duty  or  not.  The  original 
treaty  extended  the  benefit  of  Free  Trade  to  Turkish  ships  and  produce; 
the  substituted  treaty  contained  no  stipulation  whatever  on  the  sub 
ject  . ..  I  charge  these  falsifications,  I  charge  also  the  concealment of them, 
upon  the  noble  lord,  and  further—I  charge  the  noble  lord  with  having 
falsely  stated  to  the  house  that  his  treaty  was  that  which  had  been 
20  arranged  by  Mr. Urquhart."—(Speech  of  Mr.Anstey,  H.  of  C, 

15 

February  23rd,  1848.) 

So favourable to Russia, and so obnoxious to Great Britain, was the treaty 
as  altered  by  the  noble  lord,  that  some  English  merchants  in  the  Levante 
resolved  to  trade  henceforth  under  the  protection  of  Russian  firms,  and 
25  others,  as  Mr. Urquhart states, were only prevented from  so doing by a sort 

of  national  pride. 

30 

With regard to the  secret relations between the noble lord and William IV., 
Mr. Anstey  stated to the house, "The king forced the question of the process 
of  Russian  encroachment  in  Turkey,  upon  the  attention  of  the  noble 
lord  . ..  I can prove that the noble lord was  obliged to take the  directions in 
this  matter  from  the  late  king's  private  secretary,  and  that  his  existence  in 
office  depended upon his  compliance  with the wishes  of the monarch... The 
noble  lord  did  on  one  or  two  occasions,  as  far  as  he  dared,  resist,  but  his 
resistance  was  invariably followed by  abject expressions  of contrition and 
compliance.  I will not take  upon myself to  assert that,  on one  occasion, the 
noble  lord  was  actually  out  of  office  for  a day or two, but I  am able to  say 
t h at  the  noble  lord  was  in  danger  of  a  most  unceremonious  expulsion  from 
office  on that occasion.  I refer to the discovery which the late king had made, 
that  the  noble  lord  consulted  the  feelings  of  the  Russian  government  as  to 
40 the choice of an English ambassador at the Court of St. Petersburgh, and that 
Sir  Stratford  Canning,  originally  destined for the  embassy,  was  set  aside  to 

35 

427 

Karl  Marx 

make  room  for  the  late  Earl  of  Durham,  an  ambassador  more  agreeable to 
the  Czar."-(H.  of  C,  Feb. 23,  1848.) 

It  is  one  of  the  most  astonishing  facts  that,  while  the  king  was  vainly 
struggling  against  the  Russian  policy  of  the  noble  lord,  the  noble  lord  and 
his  Whig-allies  succeeded  in  keeping  alive  the  public  suspicion  that  the 
king—who  was  known  as  a Tory—was  paralysing  the  anti-Russian efforts  of 
the  "truly  English"  minister.  The  pretended  Tory  predelection  of  the 
monarch for the despotic principles of the Russian Court, was of course made 
to  explain the  otherwise  inexplicable  policy of  Lord Palmerston. The Whig-
Oligarchs  smiled  mysteriously  when H. L. Bulwer informed the house, that  10 
"no longer ago than last Christmas Count Apponyi, the Austrian ambassador 
at  Paris,  stated,  in  speaking  of  the  affairs  of  the  East,  that  this  Court  had 
a  greater  apprehension of French principles than of Russian ambition."—(H. 
of  C,  July  11,  1833.) 

5 

They smiled again, when Mr. T. Attwood interrogated the noble lord "what  15 

reception  Count  Orloff,  having  been  sent  over  to  England  after  the  treaty 
of  Unkiar  Skelessi,  had  met  with  at  his  Majesty's  Court."—(H.  of  C,  Au 
gust 28,  1833.) 

The  papers  intrusted  by  the  dying  king,  and  his  Secretary,  the  late  Sir 
Herbert  Taylor,  to  Mr. Urquhart  "for  the  purpose  of  vindicating,  upon the  20 
fitting opportunity, the memory of William IV."—will, when published, throw 
a  new  light  upon  the  past  career  of  the noble lord  and the  Whig  Oligarchy, 
of  which  the  public  generally  know  little  more  than  the  history  of  their 
pretensions,  their  phrases,  and  their  so-called  principles—in  a  word,  the 
theatrical  and fictitious  part—the  mask. 

25 

This  is  a fitting occasion to  give  his  due  to  Mr. David Urquhart, the inde 
fatigable  antagonist  for  twenty  years  of  Lord  Palmerston,  who  has  proved 
his  only  adversary—one  not  to  be  intimidated  into  silence, bribed into  con 
nivance,  charmed  into  suitorship,  while,  what  with  cajoleries,  what  with 
seductions, Alcine Palmerston contrived to  change  all other foes  into fools.  30 
We  have  just  heard  the  fierce  denunciation  of  his  lordship  by  Mr. Anstey. 
"A  circumstance  most  significant  is  that  the  accused  minister  sought  the 
member—viz.,  Mr. Anstey—and  was  content  to  accept  his  co-operation  and 
private friendship without the forms of recantation or apology. Mr. Anstey's 
recent  legal  appointment  by  the  present  government  speaks  for  itself."  35 
(D. Urquhart's  "Progress  of  Russia.") 

On  February  8th,  1848,  the  same  Mr. Anstey  had  compared  the  noble 
viscount  with  "the  infamous  Marquis  of  Carmarthen,  Secretary  of  State  to 
William  III.,  whom,  during  his  visit  to  his  court,  the  Czar,  Peter  I.,  found 
means  to  corrupt  to  his  interests  with the  gold  of  British  merchants."—(H.  40 
of  C,  February  8th,  1848.)

Lord  Palmerston.  Sixth  Article.  Seventh  Article 

Who  defended  Lord  Palmerston  on  that  occasion  against  the  accusations 
of Mr. Anstey?  Mr. Sheil; the  same  Mr. Sheil who had,  on the conclusion of 
the  treaty of Unkiar Skelessi, in  1833, acted the  same part of accuser against 
his  lordship  as  Mr. Anstey in 1848. Mr. Roebuck, once his strong antagonist, 
5  procured  him  the  vote  of  confidence  in  1850.  Sir  Stratford Canning having 
denounced  during  a  decennium  the  noble  lord's  connivance  with the  Czar, 
was  content  to  be  got  rid  of  as  Ambassador  at  Constantinople.  The  noble 
lord's  own dear Dudley Stuart was intrigued out of Parliament for some years 
for  having opposed  the noble lord. When returned back to it, he had become 
the  âme  damnée  of  the  truly  English  minister.  Kossuth,  who  might  have 
known  from  the  Blue  Books  that  Hungary  had  been betrayed  by  the  noble 
viscount,  called  him  "the  dear  friend  of  his  bosom"  when landing  at  South 
ampton.

15  One  glance  at  the  map  of  Europe  will  show  you  on the  Western litoral  of 
the  Black  Sea  the  outlets  of the  Danube, the  only river which,  springing up 
in the  very heart of  Europe,  may be  said  to form  a natural highway to Asia. 
Strictly opposite, on the Eastern side, to the  south of the river Kuban, begins 
the  mountain-range  of  the  Caucasus,  stretching  from  the  Black  Sea  to  the 
20  Caspian  in  a  south-easterly  direction  for  some  seven  hundred  miles  and 

separating  Europe  from  Asia. 

25 

If  you  hold  the  outlets  of  the  Danube,  you  hold  the  Danube,  and  with it 
the  highway  to  Asia,  and  a  great  part  of  the  commerce  of  Switzerland, 
Germany,  Hungary,  Turkey,  and  above  all  of Moldo-Wallachia.  If you hold 
the  Caucasus  too,  the  Black Sea becomes your property, and to  shut up its 
door,  you only want Constantinople  and the Dardanelles. The possession of 
the  Caucasus  mountains  makes  you  at  once  master  of  Trebizonde,  and 
through  their  domineering  the  Caspian  Sea,  of  the  northern  seaboard  of 
Persia. 

30 

The  greedy  eyes  of  Russia  embraced  at  once  the  outlets  of  the  Danube 
and  the  mountain-range  of  the  Caucasus.  There,  the  business  in  hand  was 
to  conquer  supremacy,  here  to  maintain  it.  The  chain of the Caucasus  sepa 
rates  Southern  Russia  from  the  luxurious  provinces  of  Georgia,  Mingrelia, 
Immeretia,  and  Gouriel,  wrested  by  the  Muscovite  from  the  Musselman. 
35  Thus  the foot of the  monster  empire is  cut off from its main body. The only 
military  road  deserving  to  be  called  such  winds  from  Mozdok  to  Tiflis, 

429 

Karl Marx 

through  the  aeng-pass  of Dariel,  fortified by  a continuous line of entrenched 
places,  but  exposed  on  both  sides  to  the  never-ceasing  attacks  from  the 
Caucasian  tribes.  The  union  of  those  tribes  under  one  military  chief  might 
even  endanger  the  bordering  country of  the  Cossacks.  "The  thought of the 
dreadful  consequences  which  a union  of  the  hostile  Circassians  under one 
head  would  produce  in  the  south  of  Russia fills  one with terror"—exclaims 
M. Kupffer,  a  German, who presided over the  scientific commission,  which, 
in  1829,  accompanied  the  expedition  of  General  Emmanuel  to  Elbruz. 

5 

At  this  very  moment  our  attention  is  directed  with  equal  anxiety  to  the 
banks  of  the  Danube,  where  Russia has  seized  the  two-corn  magazines  of  10 
Europe,  and  to  the  Caucasus,  whence  she  is  menaced  in the possession of 
Georgia.  It  was the treaty of Adrianople,  that prepared Russia's usurpation 
of  Moldo-Wallachia,  and  recognised  her  claims  to  the  Caucasus. 

Article  IV.  of that treaty  stipulates,  "All the  countries  situated  north  and 
east of the line of demarcation between the two empires (Russia and Turkey),  15 
towards  Georgia,  Immeretia,  and  the  Gouriel,  as  well  as  all the litoral of the 
Black  Sea,  from  the  mouth  of  the  Kuban,  as  far  as the  port of  St. Nicholas 
inclusively,  shall  remain  under  the  domination  of  Russia."  With  regard  to 
the  Danube  the  same  treaty  stipulates,  "The  frontier  line  will  follow  the 
course  of  the  Danube  to  the  mouth  of  St. George,  leaving  all  the  islands  20 
formed by the different branches in the possession of Russia. The right bank 
will remain as formerly in the possession of the Ottoman Porte. Itis however 
agreed  that that right bank from the point where the arm of St. George departs 
from  that of  Sulina,  shall remain uninhabited  to  a distance of two hours  (six 
miles)  from the  river,  and that no kind of structure shall be raised there, and  25 
in like manner, on the islands which still remain in the possession of the Court 
of Russia.  With the exception of quarantines  which will be there established, 
it will  not be  permitted  to  make  any  other establishment or fortification." 

Both  these  paragraphs,  inasmuch  as  they  secure to Russia an "extension 
of territory and exlusive commercial advantages," openly infringed upon the  30 
protocol of  April 4,1826,  drawn up by the  Duke  of Wellington at St. Peters 
burgh,  and  on  the  treaty  of  July 6,1827,  concluded between Russia  and  the 
other Great Powers  at London. The  English Government, therefore, refused 
to  recognise  the  treaty  of  Adrianople.  The  Duke  of  Wellington  protested 
against it.  (Speech  of  Lord  Dudley  Stuart,  H.  of  C,  March  17,  1837.) 

35 

Lord  Aberdeen  protested.  "In  a  dispatch  to  Lord  Heytesbury  dated 
October  31st,  1829,  he  commented  with  no  small  dissatisfaction  on  many 
parts  of  the  Treaty  of  Adrianople,  and  especially  notices  the  stipulations 
respecting  the  islands  of the  Danube.  He  denies  that that peace  (the Treaty 
of  Adrianople),  has  respected  the  territorial  rights  of  the  Sovereignty  40 
of  the  Porte,  and  the  condition  and  the  interests  of  all  maritime  states

in  the  Mediterranean."—(Speech  of  Lord  Mahon,  H.  of  C,  April  20, 
1836.) 

He  declared  that  "the  independence  of the Porte would be  sacrificed, and 
the  peace  of  Europe  endangered  by  this  treaty  being  agreed  to."-(Speech 

5  of  Earl  Grey,  H.  of  L.,  Feb.  4th,  1834.) 

10 

15 

Lord  Palmerston  himself  informs  us,  "As  far  as  the  extension  of  the 
Russian  frontier  is  concerned  in  the  south  of the  Caucasus,  and the  shores 
of  the  Black  Sea,  it  is  certainly  not  consistent  with  the  solemn declaration 
made  by  Russia  in  the  face  of  Europe,  previous  to  the  commencement  of 
the  Turkish war."  (H.  of  C,  March  17th,  1837.) 

The  Eastern  litoral  of  the  Black  Sea,  by blockading of which  and  cutting 
off  supplies  of  arms  and  gunpowder  to  the  north-western  districts  of  the 
Caucasus,  Russia  could  alone  hope  to  realise  her  nominal  claim  to  those 
countries—this  litoral  of  the  Black  Sea  and  the  outlets  of  the  Danube  are 
certainly no places  "where an English action could possibly take place,"  as 
was  lamented by the noble  lord in the case  of  Cracow.  By  what  mysterious 
contrivance,  then,  has  the  Muscovite  succeeded  in blockading the  Danube, 
in blocking up the litoral of the Euxine, and in forcing Great Britain to submit, 
not  only  to  the  Treaty  of  Adrianople,  but  at  the  same  time  to  the  violation 

20  by  Russia  herself  of  that  identical  treaty? 

25 

30 

These questions were put to the noble viscount, in the House of Commons, 
on April 20th,  1836, numerous petitions having poured in from the merchants 
of  London,  of  Glasgow,  and  other  commercial  towns,  against  the  fiscal 
regulations  of  Russia in  the  Black  Sea,  and her  enactments  and restrictions 
tending to  intercept English commerce on the Danube. There had appeared, 
on  February  7th,  1836,  a  Russian  ukase,  which,  by  virtue  of  the  Treaty  of 
Adrianople,  established  a  quarantine  on  one  of  the  islands  formed  by  the 
mouths  of  the  Danube.  In order to  execute that  quarantine, Russia claimed 
a right  of boarding  and  search, of levying fees,  and  seizing and marching off 
to  Odessa  refractory  ships,  proceeding  on  their  voyage  up  the  Danube. 
Before  the  quarantine was  established, or rather before  a custom-house  and 
fort  were  erected,  under  the  false  pretence  of  a  quarantine,  the  Russian 
authorities  threw  out  their  feelers,  to  ascertain  the  risk they  might run with 
the  British  government.  Lord  Durham,  acting  upon  instructions  received 
from  England,  remonstrated  with  the  Russian  Cabinet,  for  the  hindrance 
which had been given to British trade. "He was referred to Count Nesselrode, 
Count  Nesselrode  referred  him  to  the  Governor  of  South Russia,  and  the 
Governor  of  South  Russia  again  referred  him to  the  Consul  at  Galatz,  who 
communicated with the  British Consul at Ibraila, who was instructed to send 
40  down the captains from whom toll had been exacted, to the Danube, the scene 
of  their  injuries,  in  order  that inquiry  might be  made  on the  subject, it being 

35 

431 

Karl Marx 

well  known  that  the  captains  thus  referred  to  were  then  in  England."—(H. 
of  C,  April  20,  1836.) 

The  formal  ukase  of  the  7th  Feb.,  1836,  aroused,  however,  the  general 
attention  of  British  commerce.  "Many  ships  had  sailed,  and  others  were 
going out,  to  whose  captains  strict  orders  had  been given, not to  submit to 
the  right  of  boarding  and  search,  which  Russia  claimed.  The  fate  of  these 
ships  must  be  inevitable,  unless  some  expression  of  opinion  was  made  on 
the part of that house.  Unless that were done, British shipping, to the amount 
of  not less  than 5,000 tons,  would  be  seized  and  marched off to  Odessa, un 
til  the  insolent commands  of  Russia,  were  complied with."  (Speech of Mr. 
Patrick  M. Stewart,  H.  of  C,  April  20,  1836.)

Russia  required  the  marshy  islands  of  the  Danube,  by  virtue  of  a clause 
of  the  Treaty  of  Adrianople,  which clause itself was a violation of the treaty 
she  had  previously  contracted  with  England,  and the other powers  in  1827. 
The  bristling  the  gates  of  the  Danube  with  fortifications,  and  these  forti-  15 
f ications with guns, was a violation of the Treaty of Adrianople itself, which 
expressly  prohibits  any  fortification  to  be  erected  within  six  miles  of  the 
river.  The  exaction  of  tolls,  and  the  obstruction  of  the  navigation,  was  a 
violation  of  the  Treaty  of  Vienna,  declaring  that  "the  navigation  of  rivers 
along  their  whole  course,  from  the  point  where  each  of  them  becomes  20 
navigable  to its  mouth,  shall be  entirely free," that "the amount of the duties 
shall  in  no  case  exceed those  now  (1815)  paid;"  and  that  "no  increase  shall 
take  place,  except  with the  common consent of the  states  bordering on  the 
river."  Thus,  then,  all  the  argument on which Russia could plead  not guilty 
was  the  treaty  of  1827,  violated  by the Treaty  of Adrianople, the Treaty of  25 
Adrianople violated by herself, the whole  backed by a violation of the Treaty 
of  Vienna. 

It proved  quite  impossible  to  wring out of  the  noble  lord  any  declaration, 
whether  he  did  or  did  not  recognise  the  treaty  of  Adrianople.  As  to  the 
violation  of  the  Treaty  of  Vienna,  he  had  "received no  official  information  30 
that  anything  has  occurred  which is not warranted by the treaty.  When such 
a  statement  is  made  by  the  parties  concerned,  it  shall be  dealt with in  such 
manner as the law advisers of the Crown shall deem consistent with the  rights 
of  the  subjects  of  this  country."  (Speech  of  Lord  Palmerston,  H.  of  C, 
April 20,  1836.) 

35 

By the  treaty  of  Adrianople, Art. 5, Russia guarantees the "prosperity" of 
the  Danubian  Principalities  and  full  "liberty  of  trade"  for  them.  Now, 
Mr. Stewart  proved  that  the  Principalities  of  Moldavia and Wallachia were 
objects  of  deadly  jealousy  to  Russia,  as  their  trade  had  taken  a  sudden 
development  since  1834,  as  they  vied with Russia's own staple production,  40 
as  Galatz  was  becoming  the  great depot of  all the grain of the  Danube,  and

driving  Odessa  out  of  the  market.  "If,"  answered  the  noble  lord,  "if  my 
honourable  friend  had  been  able  to  show  that  whereas  some  years  ago  we 
had  had  a  large  and  important  commerce  with  Turkey,  and  that  that  com 
merce  had,  by  the  aggression  of  other  countries,  or  by  the  neglect  of  the 
5  government  of  this,  dwindled  down  to  an  inconsiderable  trade,  then  there 
might  have  been  ground  to  call  upon  parliament."  In lieu  of  such  an  occur 
rence,  "my  honourable  friend  has  shown  that  during the  last few  years  the 
trade  with  Turkey  has  risen  from  next  to  nothing  to  a  very  considerable 
amount." 

10 

15 

Russia  obstructs  the  Danube  navigation,  because the trade of the Princi 
palities  is growing important,  says Mr. Stewart.  But she did not so when that 
trade  was  next  to  nothing,  retorts  Lord  Palmerston.  You neglect to  oppose 
the  recent  encroachments  of  Russia  on  the  Danube,  says  Mr. Stewart.  We 
did  not  so  at  the  epoch  these  encroachments  were  not  yet  ventured  upon, 
replies  the  noble  lord.  What  "circumstances"  have,  therefore,  "occurred 
against  which  the  government are  not likely to  guard, unless  driven thereto 
by  the  direct  interference  of this  house?"  He prevented the Commons from 
passing  a  resolution  by  assuring  them  that,  "there  is  no  disposition  of  her 
Majesty's  government  to  submit  to  aggressions  on  the  part  of  any  power, 
20  be  that  power  what it  may,  and  be  it  more  or  less  strong," and by warning 
them  that,  "we  should also  cautiously abstain from anything which might be 
construed  by  other  powers,  and  reasonably  so,  as  being  a  provocation  on 
our  part."  A  week  after  these  debates  had  taken  place  in  the  House  of 
Commons,  a  British merchant  addressed  a  letter  to  the  Foreign  Office  with 
regard  to  the  Russian  Ukase.  "I  am  directed  by  Viscount  Palmerston," 
answered  the  Under  Secretary  at  the  Foreign Office,  "to  acquaint  you that 
his  lordship  has  called  upon the  law  adviser  for  the  Crown  for  his  opinion 
as  to  the regulations  promulgated  by the  Russian  Ukase  of Feb. 7,1836; but 
in  the  meantime  Lord  Palmerston  directs  me  to  acquaint you,  with respect 
to the latter part of your letter, that it is the opinion of his Majesty's govern 
ment, that no toll is justly demanded by the Russian authorities, at the mouth 
of the  Danube,  and  that you have  acted properly  in  directing your agents to 
refuse to pay it." 

25 

30 

The  merchant  acted  according  to  this  letter.  He  is  abandoned  to  Russia 
35  by  the  noble  lord;  a Russian toll  is,  as  Mr. Urquhart states, now exacted in 
London and  Liverpool by Russian Consuls, on every English ship  sailing for 
the Turkish ports of the Danube ; and "the quarantine still stands on the island 
of  Leti." 

40 

Russia did  not limit her invasion on the Danube to a quarantine established, 
to fortifications erected, and to tolls exacted. The only mouth of the Danube 
remaining  still  navigable,  the  Sulina  mouth,  was  acquired  by  her  through 

433 

Karl  Marx 

the treaty  of Adrianople.  As  long  as  possessed by the Turks, there was kept 
a  depth  of  water  in  the  channel  of  from  fourteen  to  sixteen feet.  Since  in 
the  possession  of  Russia,  the  water  became  reduced  to  eight  feet,  a  depth 
wholly  inadequate  to  the  conveyance  of  the  vessels  employed  in  the  corn 
trade.  Now Russia is  a party to the treaty of Vienna, and that treaty stipulates 
in Art.  113, that "each  state  shall be at the expense of keeping in good repair 
the  Towing  Paths,  and  shall  maintain  the  necessary  work  in  order  that  no 
obstruction shall be experienced  by the navigation." For keeping the channel 
in  a  navigable  state,  Russia  found  no better  means than gradually reducing 
the  depth  of  the  water,  paving  it  with  wrecks,  and  choking  up  its  bar  with 
an  accumulation  of  sand  and  mud.  To  this  systematic  and  protracted  in 
fraction of  the  treaty  of Vienna  she  added  another  violation of the treaty of 
Adrianople,  which  forbids  any  establishment  at  the  mouth  of  the  Sulina, 
except  for  quarantine  and  light-house  purposes,  while,  at  her  dictation,  a 
small  Russian  fort  has  there  sprung up,  living from the  extortions  upon the 
vessels,  the  occasion  for  which  is  afforded  by  the  delays  and  expenses  for 
lighterage,  consequent  upon  the  obstruction  of  the  channel. 

Cum principia negante non estdisputandum-oî what use is it to dwell upon 
abstract principles  with despotic  governments,  who  are  accused  of measur 
ing  right  by  power,  and  of  ruling  their  conduct  by  expediency,  and  not  by 
justice.-(Speech  of  Lord  Palmerston,  April  30,  1823.) 

According  to  his  own  maxim  the  noble  viscount  was  contented  to  dwell 
upon abstract principles with the despotic government of Russia; but he went 
farther.  While  he  assured  the  house  on July 6,1840,  that the  freedom of the 
Danube  navigation  was  "guaranteed  by  the  treaty  of  Vienna"—while  he 
lamented  on  July  13,1840,  that the  occupation of  Cracow,  being  a violation 
of  the  treaty  of Vienna,  "there were  no  means  of  enforcing the  opinions  of 
England,  because  Cracow  was  evidently  a  place  where  no  English  action 
could  possibly  take  place;"  two  days  later  he  concluded  a  Russian  treaty, 
closing the Dardanelles to  England  "during times of peace with Turkey," and 
thus  depriving  England  of  the  only  means  of  "enforcing"  the  treaty  of 
Vienna,  and  transforming  the  Euxine  into  a  place  where  no  English action 
could  possibly  take  place. 

This  point once obtained, he contrived to give a sham satisfaction to public 
opinion  by  firing  off  a  whole  battery  of  papers,  reminding  the  "despotic 
government,  which  measures  right by  power,  and  rules  its  conduct by  ex 
pediency,  and  not by  justice," in a sententious  and sentimental manner, that 
"Russia,  when  she  compelled  Turkey  to  cede  to  her  the  outlet  of  a  great 
European  river,  which forms  the  commercial  highway  for  the  mutual  inter 
course of many nations, undertook duties  and responsibilities to other  states 
which she should take a pride in making good. " To this dwelling upon abstract 

434 

Lord  Palmerston.  Seventh  Article.  Eighth  Article 

principles  Count  Nesselrode  was  giving  the  inevitable  answer  that,  "the 
subject  should be  carefully  examined,"  and expressing from time to time  "a 
feeling  of  soreness  on  the  part  of  the  imperial  government  at  the  mistrust 
manifested  as  to  their  intentions." 

5 

Thus,  through  the  management  of  the  noble  lord,  in  1853  things  arrived 
at  the  point  where  the  navigation  of  the  Danube  was  declared  impossible, 
and corn rotting at the mouth of the Sulina, while famine threatened to invade 
England,  France, and the South of Europe. Thus Russia was not only adding, 
as the "Times" says, "to her other important possessions, that of an iron gate 
10  between  the  Danube,  and  the  Euxine,"  she possessed herself of the key to 
the  Danube,  of  a breadscrew, which  she  can put on, whenever the policy of 
Western  Europe  becomes  obnoxious  to  punishment.

The petitions  presented  to  the  House  of Commons,  on April 20th,  1836, and 
the resolution moved by Mr. Patrick M. Stewart in reference to them, did not 
only  refer  to  the  Danube,  but  to  Circassia  too,  the  rumour  having  spread 
through the  commercial  world  that  the  Russian government,  on the  plea of 
blockading  the  coast  of  Circassia,  pretended  to  exclude  English  ships  from 
landing  goods  and  merchandise  in certain  ports  of the  Eastern litoral  of the 
20 Black Sea. On that occasion Lord Palmerston solemnly declared :—"Ji parlia 
ment  will  place  their  confidence  in  us—if  they  will  leave it to us to  manage 
the  foreign relations of the country—we  shall be able to protect the interests, 
and  to  uphold  the  honour  of  the  country,  without  being  obliged  to  have 
recourse  to  war."—(House  of  Commons,  April  20th,  1836.) 

25 

Some  months  afterwards,  on October  29th,  1836,  the  "Vixen,"  a trading 
vessel  belonging  to  Mr. George  Bell,  and  laden  with a cargo  of  salt,  set out 
from  London on a  direct voyage  for  Circassia.  On November  25th,  she was 
seized  in  the  Circassian  Bay  of  Soudjouk-Kale,  by  a  Russian  man-of-war, 
for  "having  been  employed  on  a  blockaded  coast."  (Letter  of  the  Russian 
30  Admiral Lazareff to the English Captain, Mr. Childs, December 24th,  1836.) 
The  vessel,  her  cargo,  and  her  crew  were  sent  to  the  port  of  Sebastopol, 
where  the  condemnatory  decision  of  the  Russians  was  received  on  Janu 
ary  27th,  1837.  This  time, however,  no  mention was  made of  a "blockade," 
but  the  "Vixen"  was  simply  declared  a lawful prize, because  "it was guilty 
35  of  smuggling;"  the  importation  of  salt  being  prohibited,  and  the  Bay  of 
Soudjouk-Kale,  a  Russian  port,  not  provided  with  a  Custom  House.  The 

435 

Karl  Marx 

condemnation  was  executed  in  an  exquisitely  ignominious  and  insulting 
manner.  The  Russians,  who  effected  the  seizure,  were  publicly  rewarded 
with  decorations.  The  British  flag  was  hoisted,  then  hauled  down,  and  the 
Russian  flag  hoisted  in  its  stead.  The  master  and  crew,  put  as  captives  on 
board the  "Ajax"—the  captor—were despatched from  Sebastopol to Odessa, 
and from  Odessa to  Constantinople,  whence they  were  allowed to  return to 
England.  As  to  the  vessel  itself,  a  German  traveller, who visited  Sebastopol 
a  few  years  after  this  event,  wrote,  in  a  letter  addressed  to  the  "Augsburg 
Gazette":-"After  all  the  Russian  ships  of  the  line  which I visited, no vessel 
excited  my  curiosity  more  than the  'Soudjouk-Kale,'  formerly the  'Vixen,'  10 
under Russian colours, she has now quite changed her appearance. This little 
vessel  is  now the best  sailer in the Russian  fleet,  and is  generally  employed 
in  transports  between  Sebastopol  and  the  coast  of  Circassia." 

5 

The  capture  of  the  "Vixen"  certainly  afforded  Lord  Palmerston  a  great 
occasion  for  fulfiUing  his  promise  "to  protect  the  interests,  and  to  uphold  15 
the  honour  of  the  country."  Besides  the  honour  of  the  British flag and  the 
interests  of  British  commerce there was  another question at  stake—the inde 
pendence  of Circassia.  At first  Russia  justified  the  seizure  of  the  "Vixen" 
on the  plea of  an  infraction  of  the  blockade  proclaimed by  her;  but the  ship 
was  condemned on the  opposite  plea of a contravention against her Custom 
House  regulations.  By  proclaiming  a blockade, Russia declared  Circassia a 
hostile foreign country, and the question was whether the British government 
had  ever  recognised that blockade?  By the  establishment  of  Custom House 
regulations, Circassia was, on the contrary, treated as a Russian dependency, 
and  the  question  was  whether  the  British government  had ever recognised  25 
the  Russian  claims  to  Circassia? 

20 

Before  proceeding,  let  it  be  remembered  that  Russia  was  at  that  epoch, 

yet  far  from  having  completed  her  fortifications  of  Sebastopol. 

Any  Russian  claim  to  the  possession  of  Circassia  could  only  be  derived 
from  the  treaty  of  Adrianople,  as  explained  in  a  previous  article.  But the  30 
treaty  of  July  6th,  1827,  bound  Russia  to  not  attempting  any  territorial  ag 
grandisement,  nor  securing  any  exclusive  commercial  advantage  from  her 
war with Turkey. Any extension, therefore, of the Russian frontier, attendant 
on  the  treaty  of  Adrianople,  openly  infringed  the  treaty  of  1827,  and  was, 
as  shown by  the  protest  of  Wellington  and Aberdeen, not to be recognised  35 
on  the  part  of  Great  Britain.  Russia,  then,  had  no  right to  receive  Circassia 
from  Turkey.  On  the  other  hand,  Turkey  could  not cede  to  Russia what she 
never  possessed,  and  Circassia had  always  remained  so  independent of  the 
Porte  that,  at  the  time  when  a Turkish  Pasha  yet  resided  at  Anapa,  Russia 
herself had concluded  several conventions  with the Circassian chieftains as  40 
to  the  coast-trade,  the  Turkish trade  being  exclusively and legally restricted 

436 

Lord  Palmerston.  Eighth  Article 

5 

10 

15 

20 

to  the  port  of  Anapa.  Circassia  being  an independent  country,  the  munici 
pal,  sanatory,  or  customs'  regulations  with  which  the  Muscovite  might 
think  fit  to  provide  her  were  as  binding  as  his  regulations  for  the  port  of 
Tampico. 

On  the  other  hand,  if  Circassia was  a foreign  country  hostile  to  Russia, 
the  latter  had  only  a right to  blockade,  if that blockade  was  no  paper block 
ade—if  Russia  had  the  naval  squadron  present  to  enforce  it,  and  really 
domineered the coast. Now, on a coast extending 200 miles, Russia possessed 
but  three  isolated  forts;  all  the  rest  of  Circassia  remaining  in  the  hands  of 
the  Circassian tribes.  There  existed no  Russian fort in the bay of Soudjouk-
Kale.  There  was  in  fact,  no  blockade,  because  no  maritime  force  was  em 
ployed.  There  was  the  offer  of  the  distinct  testimony  of  the  crew  of  two 
British  vessels  who  had  visited  the  bay—the  one  in  September,  1834—the 
other,  that  of  the  "Vixen"  itself—confirmed  subsequently  by  the  public 
statements of two British travellers who visited the harbour in the years 1837 
and  1838, that there was no Russian occupation whatever of the coast.—(Port 
folio  VIII,  March  1,  1844.) 

When the  "Vixen" entered the harbour of  Soudjouk-Kale,  "there were no 
Russian  ships  of  war  in  sight  nor  in  the  offing  . ..  A  Russian vessel  of war 
came into  the  harbour 36 hours  after the  'Vixen' had cast anchor, and at the 
moment  when  the  owner  and  some  of  the  officers  were  on  shore  in  fixing 
the  dues  demanded  by  the  Circassian  authorities,  and payable  on the  value 
of  the  goods  . ..  The  man-of-war  came  not  coast-wise,  but  from  the  open 
sea."-(Speech  of  Mr. Anstey,  H.  of  C,  Feb. 23,  1848.) 

25 

But  need  we  give  further  proofs  than  the  St. Petersburgh Cabinet  itself 
seizing the  "Vixen"  en pretext of  blockade,  and  confiscating  it,  en pretext 
of  custom-house  regulations? 

The  Circassians  thus  appeared  the  more  favoured  by  accident,  as  the 
question  of  their  independence  coincided  with  the  question  of  the  free 
30  navigation  of  the  Black-Sea—the  protection  of  British  commerce,  and  an 
insolent  act of piracy committed by Russia on a British merchant ship. Then-
chance  of  obtaining  protection  from  the  mistress  of  the  seas  seemed  less 
doubtful as  "the  Circassian declaration of independence had a short time ago 
been published  after mature  deliberation and  several weeks' correspondence 
35  with  different branches  of the government, in a periodical ("The Portfolio") 
connected  with the  foreign  department,  and  as  Circassia was marked out as 
an  independent  country  in  a  map,  revised  by  Lord  Palmerston  himself."— 
(Speech  of  Lord  Stanley,  H.  of  C,  June  21,1838.) 

40 

Will  it then be believed  that the  noble  and chivalrous Viscount knew how 
to  handle  the  case  so  masterly,  that  the  very  act  of  piracy  committed  by 
Russia  against  British  property  afforded  him  the  long  sought-for  occasion 

437 

Karl Marx 

of  formally  recognising  the  treaty  of  Adrianople,  and  the  extinction  of 
Circassian  independence? 

OnMarch  17,1837, Mr. Roebuck moved, with reference to the confiscation 
of the  "Vixen,"  for  "a copy  of  all correspondence  between the government 
of  this  country  and  the  governments  of  Russia  and  Turkey relating to  the 
treaty  of  Adrianople,  as  well  as  all  transactions  or  negotiations  connected 
with the  ports  and  territories  on the  shores of the Black Sea by Russia since 
the  treaty  of  Adrianople." 

Mr. Roebuck,  from  fear  of  being  suspected  of  humanitarian  tendencies, 
and  of  defending  Circassia  on  the  ground  of  abstract  principles,  plainly 
declared:—"Russia may endeavour to obtain possession of all the world, and 
I  regard  her  efforts  with  indifference;  but  the  moment  she  interferes  with 
our  commerce,  I  call  upon  the  government  of  this  country  (which  country 
exists in appearance  somewhere beyond the limits of all the world), to punish 
the  aggression."  Accordingly he wanted  to know  "if the British government 
had  acknowledged  the  treaty  of  Adrianople?" 

5 

10 

15 

The noble lord, although pressed very hard, had ingenuity enough to make 
a long  speech,  and  "to  sit down without telling the house  who  was in actual 
possession of  the  Circassian coast  at the  present moment—whether it really 
belonged  to  Russia,  and  whether  it  was  by  right  of  a  violation  of  fiscal  20 
regulations,  or  in consequence  of an existing blockade,  that the  'Vixen' had 
been  seized,  and  whether  or  not  he  recognised the  Treaty  of  Adrianople." 
(Speech  of  Mr. Hume,  H.  of  C,  March  17th,  1837.) 

Mr. Roebuck  stated  that,  before  allowing  the  "Vixen"  to  proceed  to  Cir 

cassia,  Mr. Bell  had  applied to the noble  lord, in order to ascertain whether  25 
there  was  any  impropriety or  danger  to  be  apprehended  of  a vessel  landing 
goods  in  any  part  of  Circassia,  and that the  Foreign  Office  answered in  the 
negative.  Thus,  Lord  Palmerston found  himself  obliged to read to the house 
the correspondence exchanged between himself and Mr. Bell. Reading these 
letters,  one would fancy  he was  reading a  Spanish comedy on the cloak and  30 
the  sword,  rather  than  an  official  correspondence  between  a  minister  and 
a  merchant.  When  he  heard  the  noble  lord  read  the  letters  respecting  the 
seizure  of  the  "Vixen,"  Daniel  O'Connell  exclaimed,  "He  could  not  help 
calling  to  his  mind  the  expression  of  Talleyrand  that  language  had  been 
invented to conceal thoughts." 

35 

For instance,  Mr. Bell  asks, "whether there were any restrictions on trade 
recognised  by  His  Majesty's  government—as,  if  not,  he  intended  to  send 
thither  a vessel with  a cargo  of  salt?"  "You ask me," answers Lord Palmer 
ston,  "whether it  would  be  for  your  advantage  to  engage  in  a  speculation in 
salt," and informs him "that it is for commercial f irms to judge for themselves 40 
whether  they  shall  enter  or  decline  a  speculation."  "By no  means,"  repues 

438 

Lord  Palmerston.  Eighth  Article 

Mr. Bell.  "All  I  want  to  know  is,  whether or  not His  Majesty's government 
recognise  the  Russian  blockade  on  the  Black  Sea to  the  South  of the  river 
Kuban?"  "You  must  look  at  the  London 'Gazette'," retorts  the  noble lord, 
"in  which  all  the  notifications,  such  as those  alluded to by you,  are  made." 
5  The  London "Gazette" was, indeed, the quarter to which a British merchant 
had  to  refer  for  such  information,  instead  of  the  ukases  of  the  Emperor  of 
Russia.  Mr.  Bell,  finding  no  indication  whatever  in  the  "Gazette"  of  the 
acknowledgement  of  the  blockade  or  of  other  restrictions,  despatched  his 
vessel.  The  result  was,  that  some  time  after  he  was  himself  placed  in  the 

10  "Gazette." 

"I  referred  Mr. Bell,"  says  Lord  Palmerston,  "to  the  'Gazette,' where  he 
would  find  that  no  blockade  had  been  communicated  or  declared  to  this 
country  by  the  Russian  government—consequently,  none  was  acknowl 
edged."  By referring Mr. Bell to the "Gazette," Lord Palmerston did not only 
15  deny  the  acknowledgement  on  the  part  of  Great  Britain  of  the  Russian 
blockade,  but  simultaneously  affirmed  that,  in  his  opionion,  the  Coast  of 
Circassia formed  no part oí the  Russian territory,  because  blockades of their 
own  territories  by  foreign  states—as  for  instance  against revolted  subjects-
are  not  to  be  notified  in  the  "Gazette."  Circassia  forming  no  part  of  the 
20 Russian territory could not, of course, be included in Russian Custom House 
regulations.  Thus,  according to  his own statement, Lord Palmerston denied, 
in his  letters to  Mr. Bell, Russia's  right to blockade  the  Circassian  Coast,  or 
to  subject  it  to  commercial  restrictions.  It  is  true  that,  through  his  speech, 
transpired  the  desire  to induce the house to infer that Russia had possession 
25  of  Circassia.  But,  on  the  other  hand,  he  stated  plainly,  "As  far  as  the  ex 
tension  of  the  Russian  frontier  is  concerned,  on the  South  of the  Caucasus 
and the  shores of the Black Sea, it is  certainly not consistent with the solemn 
declaration  made  by  Russia  in  the  face  of  Europe,  previous  to  the  com 
mencement  of  the  Turkish  war."  When  he  sat  down,  pledging himself  ever 
"to protect the interests and to uphold the honour of the country," he seemed 
to  labour  beneath  the  accumulated  miseries  of  his  past  policy,  rather  than 
hatching  treacherous  designs  for  the  future.  On  that  day  he  met  with  the 
following  cruel  apostrophe:— 

30 

35 

40 

"The  want  of  vigorous  alacrity to  defend the honour of the  country which 
the  noble  lord  had  displayed was  most culpable;  the  conduct  of no former 
minister had ever been so vacillating, so hesitating, so uncertain, so cowardly, 
when  insult  had  been offered  to  British  subjects.  How  much longer did  the 
noble  lord  propose  to  allow  Russia thus  to  insult Great Britain,  and thus to 
injure  British  commerce?  The  noble  lord  was d e g r a d i ng  England by hold-
ing her  out  in  the  character of a bully—haughty and tyrannical to  the weak, 
humble  and  abject  to  the  strong." 

439 

Karl  Marx 

Who  was  it  that  thus  mercilessly  branded  the  truly  English  Minister? 

Nobody  else  than  Lord  Dudley  Stuart. 

On  November  25th,  1836,  the  "Vixen"  was  confiscated.  The  stormy 
debates  of  the  House  of Commons, just quoted,  took place  on  March  17th, 
1837. It was not till April 19th,  1837, that the noble lord requested the Russian 
government  "to  state  the  reasons  on  account  of which it had thought itself 
warranted to  seize, in time  of peace,  a merchant vessel belonging to  British 
subjects." On May  17th,  1837, the noble lord received the following despatch 
from  the  Earl  of  Durham,  the  British  Ambassador  at  St. Petersburg:— 

"My Lord,—With respect to the military  de facto occupation of  Soudjouk- 
Kale,  I  have  to  state to your lordship that there is  a fortress in the bay which 
bears  the  name  of the  Empress  (Alexandrinski),  and  that it has always been 
occupied  by  a  Russian  garrison. 

5 

10 

I  have,  etc.,  D u r h a m ." 
It  need  hardly  be  remarked  that  the  fort  Alexandrinski  had not even the  15 

reality  of the  pasteboard towns  exhibited by  Potemkin,  before  the Empress 
Katharine  II.,  on  her  visit  to  the  Crimea.  Five  days  after the receipt of this 
despatch,  Lord  Palmerston  returns  the  following  answer  to  S t P e t e r s-
b u r g :-

"His  Majesty's  government,  considering in the first place that Soudjouk-  20 

Kale,  which was  acknowledged by Russia in the treaty  of  1783  as a Turkish 
possession,  now belongs  to  Russia,  as  stated by-Lord Nessehode, by virtue 
of  the  Treaty  of  Adrianople,  see  no  sufficient  reason  to  question  the  right 
of  Russia  to  seize  and  confiscate  the  'Vixen'." 

There  are  some  very  curious  circumstances  connected  with  the  negoti-  25 

ation.  Lord  Palmerston  requires  six  months  of  premeditation  for  opening, 
and hardly one to close it. His last despatch, of May 23d,  1837, suddenly and 
abruptly  cuts  off  any  further  transactions.  It  quotes  the  date  before  the 
Treaty  of  Kudschuk-Kainardji,  not  after  the  Gregorian,  but  after  the  Greek 
chronology. Besides, "between April 19th, and May 23rd," as Sir Robert Peel  30 
said,  "a  remarkable  change,  from  official  declaration  to  satisfaction,  oc 
curred—apparently  induced  by  the  assurance  received  from  Count  Nessel 
rode,  that  Turkey  had  ceded  the  coast  in  question  to  Russia  by  the Treaty 
of  Adrianople.  Why  did  he  not  protest  against  this  ukase?"  (H.  of  C, 
June  21st,  1838.) 

35 

Why  all  this?  The  reason  is  very  simple.  King William  IV.  had  secretly 
instigated  Mr. Bell to  despatch the  "Vixen"  to the Coast of Circassia. When 
the  noble  lord  delayed  negotiation,  the  King  was  still  in  full  health.  When 
he  suddenly closed the negotiations, William IV.  was in the agonies of death, 
and  Lord  Palmerston  disposed  as  absolutely of the  Foreign Office,  as  if he  40 
was  himself  the  Autocrat  of Great Britain.  Was it not a master-stroke on the 

440 

Lord  Palmerston.  Eighth  Article 

part  of  his  jocose  lordship  to  formally  acknowledge  by one  dash of  the  pen 
the  Treaty  of  Adrianople,  Russia's  possession  of  Circassia,  and  the  con 
fiscation of  the  "Vixen," in the name of the dying king, who had despatched 
that  saucy  "Vixen,"  with the  express  view to  mortify  the  Czar, to disregard 
the  Treaty  of  Adrianople,  and  to  affirm  the  independence  of  Circassia? 

5 

Mr. Bell, as we stated, went into the "Gazette," and Mr. Urquhart then the 
first  secretary  of  the  Embassy  at  Constantinople,  was  recalled,  because  of 
"having  persuaded  Mr. Bell  to  carry  his  'Vixen'  expedition  into  execu 
tion." 

10 

As long as King William  TV. was alive, Lord Palmerston dared not openly 
countermand the "Vixen"  expedition,  as is proved by the Circassian declara 
tion  of  independence,  published  in  the  Portfolio,  by  the  Circassian  m a p-
revised  by  his  lordship—by  his  uncertain  correspondence  with  Mr. Bell, by 
his  vague  declarations  in  the  house,  by  the  supercargo  of  the  "Vixen," 
15  Mr. Bell's brother, receiving, when setting out, despatches from the Foreign 
Office  for  the  Embassy  at  Constantinople,  and  direct encouragement from 
Lord  Ponsonby,  the  British  Ambassador  to  the  Sublime  Porte. 

20 

25 

In  the  earlier  times  of  Queen  Victoria,  the  Whig  ascendancy  seemed  to 
be  safer  than  ever,  and  accordingly  the  language  of the  chivalrous  viscount 
suddenly changed.  From  deference  and  cajolery,  it became at once haughty 
and contemptuous. Interrogated by Mr. T. H. Attwood, on Dec. 14,1837, with 
regard  to  the  "Vixen"  and  Circassia—"As  to  the  'Vixen,'  Russia  had given 
such  explanations  of her  conduct  as  ought to  satisfy  the  government of this 
country.  That ship was  not taken during a blockade.  It was captured because 
those who had the management of it contravened the municipal and customs' 
regulations  of  Russia."  As  to  Mr. Attwood's  apprehension  of  Russian  en 
croachment—"I  say that Russia gives to the world quite as  much security for 
the  preservation  of  peace  as  England."  (Speech of Lord Palmerston,  H.  of 
C,  Dec.  14,  1837.) 

30 

At  the  close  of  the  session the  noble  lord  laid before  the  house  the  cor 
respondence  with the  Russian government,  the  two  most important parts of 
which  we  have  already  quoted. 

In  1838  party-aspects  had  again  changed,  and  the  Tories  recovered  an 
influence.  On  June  21st  they  gave  Lord  Palmerston  a  round  charge,  Su 
ss  Stratford  Canning,  the  present  Ambassador  at  Constantinople,  moving  for 
a  Select Committee  to  inquire into  the  allegations  made by  Mr. George  Bell 
against  the  noble  lord,  and  in  his  claims  of  indemnification.  At  first  his 
lordship  was  highly  astonished  that  Sir  Stratford's  motion  should be  of  "so 
trifling a character."  "You," exclaimed Sir Robert Peel, "are the first English 
40  minister  who  dares  to  call  trifles  the protection of the  British property and 
commerce."  "No individual merchant,"  said Lord Palmerston, "was entitled 

441 

Karl  Marx 

to  ask Her Majesty's government to give an opinion on questions of that sort, 
as  the  right  of  Russia  to  the  sovereignty  of  Circassia,  or  to  establish those 
customs  and  sanatory  regulations,  she  was  enforcing  by  the  power  of  her 
arms."  "If  that  be  not  your  duty,  what  is  the  use  of  the  Foreign  Office  at 
all?"  asked  Mr. Hume.  "It  is  said,"  resumed  the  noble lord,  "that Mr. Bell, 
this  innocent Mr. Bell,  was  led  into  a trap  by me  by the  answers  I gave him. 
The trap, if there was one, was laidnotfor Mr. Bell, but by Mr. Bell," namely, 
by  the  questions  he  put  to  innocent  Lord  Palmerston.

In  the  course  of  these  debates  (June  21st,  1838),  out  came  at length  the 
great  secret.  Had  he  been  willing  to  resist in  1836 the claims  of Russia, the 
noble lord had been unable to  do  so from the very simple reason that, already 
in  1831  his  first  act  on  coming  into  office  was  to  acknowledge  the  Russian 
usurpation  of  the  Caucasus,  and  thus,  in  a  surreptitious  way,  the  treaty  of 
Adrianople.  Lord Stanley (now Lord Derby) stated that, on August 8th, 1831, 
the  Russian  Cabinet  informed  its  representative  at  Constantinople  of  its  15 
intention  "to  subject  to  sanatory  regulations  the  communications  which 
freely  exist  between  the  inhabitants  of  the  Caucasus  and  the  neighbouring 
Turkish  provinces,"  and that he was  "to communicate the above-mentioned 
regulations  to  the foreign missions  at Constantinople  as  well  as  to  the Otto 
man  Government."  By  allowing Russia the  establishment of so-called sana-  20 
tory  and  custom-house  regulations  on the coast of Circassia, although exist 
ing  nowhere except in the above letter, Russian claims to the Caucasus were 
acknowledged,  and  consequently  the  treaty  of  Adrianople,  on  which  they 
were  grounded.  "Those  instruction,"  said  Lord  Stanley,  "had  been  com 
municated  in  the  most  formal  manner  to  Mr. Mandeville  (Secretary  to  the  25 
Embassy),  at  Constantinople,  expressly  for  the  information  of  the  British 
merchants,  and  transmitted  to  the  noble  Lord  Palmerston."  Neither  did  he, 
nor  dared  he,  "according  to  the  practice  of  former  governments,  com 
municate  to  the  committee  at Lloyd's  the  fact of  such  a  notification having 
been  received."  The  noble  lord  made  liimself  guilty  of  "a  six  years'  con-  30 
cealment,"  exclaimed  Sir  Robert  Peel. 

On  that day his  jocose lordship  escaped from  condemnation by  a majority 
of  sixteen;  184 votes being against, and 200 for him. Those sixteen votes will 
neither out-voice History nor silence the mountaineers, the clashing of whose 
arms proves to the world that the Caucasus does not "now belong to Russia,  35 
as  stated  by  Count  Nessehode,"  and  as  echoed  by  Lord  Palmerston!

The War Question-
Financial  Matters—Strikes. 

Correspondence  of  The  N.Y.Tribune. 

London,  Friday,  Oct. 7,  1853. 

5  On Friday last,  The Morning Chronicle, in its fourth edition, communicated 
a  telegraphic  despatch,  according  to  which  the  Sultan  had  declared  war 
against Russia.  The Paris  Patrie of  yesterday evening announces, in a semi 
official  note,  that the  intelligence  received  from  the  East,  does  not  confirm 
the  statement of  The Morning Chronicle. According to another Ministerial 
10  paper,  The  Constitutionnel, it  was  on the  reiterated representations of Mr. 
de  Bruck,  the  Austrian  internuncio,  that  the  Divan  assembled  on  the  25th, 
with  the  view  to  deliberate  on  the  Vienna  note,  when  it  declared  it  would 
abide  by  the  last  note  of  Rechid Pasha.  A  Grand  Council was  convoked on 
the following day.  This  Council  consisting of  120 of the principal Ministers, 
is  Councillors,  Pashas  and  religious  dignitaries,  resolved  that  "it  would  be 
contrary  to  the  dignity,  and  subversive  of  the  sovereign  authority  of  the 
Sultan  to  sign  the  Vienna  note  without  the  modifications  suggested  by  the 
Divan,  and  that,  inasmuch  as  the  Czar  had  declared those  modifications  to 
be  totally  inadmissible,  and  refused  to  abandon  his  demand  for  an  en-
20  gagement  destructive  of  the  independence  of  the  Ottoman  Empire,  it  only 
remained  for  the  Council  to  advise  the  Sultan  to  proceed  at  once  to  adopt 
thérneasures  necessary  for  the  preservation  of  his  Empire,  and to  free  his 
dominions  from  the  presence  of  the  invader."  As  to  the  formal declaration 
of  war,  it  has  not yet been confirmed by  any  authentic  dispatch.  This  time, 
at least, the Porte has caught the Western diplomats. The English and French 
Governments,  not  daring to  call their fleets home, unable to hold any longer 

25 

443 

Karl  Marx 

their  ridiculous  position at Besika Bay,  unwilling to pass  the  straits  in open 
defiance  to  the  Czar,  wanted  the  Porte  to  send  for  ships  from  Besika  Bay 
on  the  pretext  that  danger  to  the  Christians  at  Constantinople  was  to  be 
apprehended  during  the  fêtes  of  the  Bairam.  The  Porte  refused,  observing 
that  there  was  no  danger;  that  if  there  was,  it would protect the Christians 
without foreign  aid,  and  that it did  not wish to  summon  the  ships  until after 
the fêtes.  But the vanguard of the  united fleets had hardly crossed the straits, 
when  the  Porte,  having  now  put  its  vacillating  and treacherous  allies into  a 
fix,  declared  for  war.  As  to  the war  itself,  it  commenced  three  months  ago, 
when  the  Russian  forces  crossed  the  Pruth.  The  first  campaign  was  even  10 
brought to  a close when the Russianlegions reached the banks of the Danube. 
The  only  change  that  can  now  take  place  will  be  that  the  war will cease to 
be  a  one-sided  one.

Not  only  the  Bey  of  Tunis,  but  the  Shah  of  Persia,  notwithstanding  the 
intrigues  of  Russia,  has  placed  at the  disposal of the  Sultan  a corps of 6,000  15 
of his best troops. The Turkish army, then, may truly be said to be a mustering 
of all the  available forces of Mohamedanism in Europe, Africa, and Western 
Asia. The hosts of the two religions which have long struggled for supremacy 
in  the  East,  the  Russo-Greek  and  the  Mohammedan  are  now fronting  each 
other,  the  one  summoned  by the  arbitrary will of  a  single  man—the other by  20 
the  fatal  force  of  circumstances,  according  to  their  mutual  creeds,  as  the 
Russo-Greek  Church  rejects  the  dogma  of  predestination,  while  Moham 
medanism  centers  upon  fatalism. 

To-day  two  meetings  are  to  be  held, the  one  in Downing-st.—the  other  at 
the  London  Tavern;  the  one  by  the  ministers—the  other  against  them;  the  25 
one  in  favor of the  Czar—the  other in favor of  the  Sultan.  From  the  leaders 
of  The  Times  and  Morning Chronicle, we  might infer,  if  there  could exist 
any  doubt  about  the  intention of the  Coalition, that it will try to  the utmost 
to  prevent war,  to  resume  negotiations, to kill time,  to  paralyze the Sultan's 
army,  and  to  support the  Czar  in the  Principalities. 

30 

"The  Czar  has  declared  for  peace,"  The  Times  is  happy  to  state,  upon 
undoubted  authority.  The Czar has expressed "pacific  sentiments at Olmütz 
by his own lips." He will not accept the modifications the Porte has proposed ; 
he  will  abide  by  the  original  Vienna  note,  but  he  will  allow  the  Vienna 
conference  to  interpret  the  note  in a preternatural sense,  contradictory to  35 
his  own  Nesselröden  interpretation.  He  will  allow  them  to  occupy  them 
selves with conferences, provided they allow him, meanwhile, to occupy the 
Principalities. 

The  Times,  in its peace  paroxysm,  compares  the  two Emperors of Russia 
and  Austria  to  a  couple  of  savage  chiefs  in  the  interior  of  Africa,  in  order  40 
to  arrive  at  the  conclusion:  "After  all,  what  does  the  world  care  for  the 

444 

The War  Question—Financial  Matters—Strikes 

Emperor of Russia, that it should go to war out of deference to his political 
mistakes?" 

The  banks  of  Turin,  Paris,  Berlin  and  Warsaw  have  raised  their  rate  of 
discount.  In  the  bank  returns  of  last  week,  the  bullion reserve  of  the  Bank 
5  of England was  stated  to  have  again decreased by £181,615, its total amount 
now  being  only  £15,680,783.  The  active  circulation  of  notes  has  decreased 
to  the  extent of nearly £500,000, while  the  discount of bills has increased by 
£400,000,  a  coincidence  which  confirms  the  statement  I  made  in  my  letter 
on  the  Peel  Act,  that  the  amount  of  bank  notes  in  circulation  does  not 
rise  and  fall  in  proportion  to  the  amount  of  banking  business  which  is 
done. 

10 

20 

Mr. Dornbush  concludes  his  monthly  Commercial  Circular  as follows: 
"Political  events  during  the  last week have greatly  added to  the  agitation 
in the Corn trade, caused by the  increasing reports of a deficient wheat crop, 
15 the spreading of the potato disease and the scarcity of ship-room. Town flour 
has  advanced to 70 shillings per 280 pounds, new wheat to 80 shillings, with 
a rising  discount  approaching  5  per et.  A great excitement now pervades the 
corn trade—the  probability of  a war  in  the  East, the prohibition of exporting 
grain  from  Egypt,  the  confirmed  deficiency  in  the  wheat  crop  in  England, 
the  spreading  of  the  potato  disease,  the  falling  off  in the  foreign  arrivals, 
(especially  from  the  South  of  Europe),  the  continued  demand  for  France, 
Belgium  and  Holland—these  were  the  principal  exciting  causes  that  again 
drove  up  prices  of  wheat  variously  from  one  shilling  to  six  shilüngs  per 
quarter  in  the  leading  provincial  markets  held  last  week  . ..  Generally,  im-
25  mediately  after harvest, the tendency of prices is and remains downward till 
Christmas. This  year the movement has been the r e v e r s e . .. Prices have been 
rising for  some  months  past.  At this  moment there is no actual want of corn 
in  any part of this quarter of the globe; many granaries, barns and rick-yards 
are  full  to  repletion,  and  in  some  sea-ports  store-room is  wanting. The  late 
rise in price, therefore, has not been caused by a present, but by a prospective 
scarcity  of  corn,  founded  on  the  presumption  of  a  deficiency  in the  crops, 
the  effects  of  which  are  expected  to  be  felt  as  the  season  advances.  The 
coming winter  is  likely to prove  one  of great hardship  and privation... The 
prevailing  opinion  is  still  in  favor  of  a further advance in prices;  and  while 
the bulk of  speculators  continue  'buying and  storing,' the tendency is  likely 
to  remain  upward,  probably  till  next  spring  . ..  The  presumable  high  range 
of prices  during the  next winter  is  likely to become, in the following spring, 
a  great  attraction  to  the  importation  of  corn  from  distant  regions,  which,  in 
ordinary seasons, cannot be reached on account of the distance and high cost 
of carriage;  next  spring an accumulation of arrivals from all accessible parts 
of  the  world  is  not  improbable;  and  the  very  cause  which now  contributes 

35 

30 

40 

445 

Karl  Marx 

to  raise the price by the withdrawal of stocks from sale, will, with the  setting 
in  of  the  downward  tide  of  prices,  tend to  depress  the  value  of corn with a 
force  commensurate  to  the  then  eagerness  of  holders  to  dispose  of  their 
stocks. Now the rule is to buy; then the watchword will be to sell. Next year 
may prove  as  dangerous  and disastrous  as  1847."

The general depression in the Manchester market continues. In proportion 
as  the  news from Australia and China,  as  well  as  that regarding the Eastern 
complication,  are  taking  a  more  gloomy  character,  the  minds  of  cotton-
spinners,  manufacturers  and  merchants, become  more unsettled. The fall in 
prices  may  now  be  considered  in ordinary  qualities  and Nos.  of yarn to be  10 
from7ls  to  Id.  per lb.,  from the  highest point two  months  ago, which is very 
near twice as  much as the fall in the corresponding quality of cotton, amount 
ing to no more than V2 to 5/8d. And even at the extreme reduction of Id., people 
find  it  difficult  to  sell,  and  stocks,  the  bugbears  of  our  sympathetic  school 
of  political  economists,  go  on  accumulating.  Of  course  it must not be  ex-  15 
pected  that  this  accumulation  of  stocks  will  increase  very  rapidly;  at  the 
present  moment  both  merchants  and  manufacturers,  on  finding  several 
markets  overstocked,  have  yet  the  outlet  of  sending  their  goods,  on  con 
signment,  to  other  markets,  and  this  faculty  they  very largely  use just now. 
But to throw the  entire exportable produce of British industry, large enough  20 
to  swamp,  at  regular  intervals,  the  whole  world,  upon  a  few  more  or  less 
confined  markets,  will  necessarily  excite  the  same  state of plethora,  and the 
revulsions consequent upon it, in those very markets which are as yet, stated 
to be healthy. Thus it is that the slightly-improved news from India, according 
to  which  there  still  is  no  chance  of  profitable  exportation  to  that  country,  25 
but  merely  a  chance  of  diminishing  loss  upon  fresh  exports,  has  induced  a 
rather considerable business to  that country, partly on account of the regular 
India houses,  partly on account of the Manchester  spinners  and manufactur 
ers  themselves,  who,  rather  than  submit  to  the  loss  incumbent  upon  sales 
in  a  declining  market,  prefer  taking  whatever  slight  chance  of  a better  sale  30 
there  may  result  from  a  speculative  export  to  India.  And  here  I  may  add, 
that  it  has  been  ever  since  1847  a  regular  practice  with  the  Manchester 
spinners  and  manufacturers  to  send  out  for  their  own  account,  large  ship 
ments to India, etc., and to have the returns in Colonial produce, sold equally 
for their own account either in British North America or Continental harbors.  35 
These  speculations  do  not,  certainly, belong to the legitimate trading sphere 
of the manufacturer, who  is necessarily not half as well informed of the state 
of the  markets  as the  sea-port  merchant,  but they please the  British cotton-
spinner  who,  while  directing  such  distant operations, believes  that favorite 
illusion  realized,  in  which  he  imagines  himself  the  supreme  director,  the  40 
ruling  mind,  as  it  were,  of  the  world's  trade  and  commercial  destinies.  And 

446

if  it  were  not  for  these  speculations  which  hold  fast  for  a  year  or  eighteen 
months  a  considerable  portion  of  the  industrial  surplus  capital,  there  is  no 
doubt that the  extension  of  manufactures  in  England  would for the last five 
years  have  gone  on  at  a  still  more  rapid  rate. 

5 

In  the  dry  goods  market,  domestics  are  the  articles  suffering  under  the 
greatest  depression;  stocks  continue to  accumulate although a great number 
of looms have been stopped. Yet it cannot be said that there is anything doing 
in  other  sorts  of  goods. 

15 

A  similar  stagnation  prevails  at  Leeds  and  Bradford,  at  Leicester  and 
10  Nottingham.  At the latter  place the hours  of  work have been reduced to ten 
and even eight in the lace  trade; hosiery has been depressed ever since June 
last,  when the  production  was  at once  reduced in  Nottingham,  by  one-third 
of its amount. The only trade that appears to go on in uninterrupted prosper 
ity  for  the  present,  is  the  hardware trade  of  Birmingham  and  its vicinity. 
At London, bankruptcy begins to spread among the small shop-keepers. 
In  my  letter  of  August  12,1  stated  that  the  master  spinners  and  manu 
facturers  were  getting  up  "An  Association  for  the  purpose  of  aiding  the 
trade  in  regulating  the  excitement  among  operatives  in  the  Manchester 
District,"  that  that  Association  was  to  consist of local  Associations,  with a 
20  Central  Committee,  and  that  it  intended  "resisting  all  demands  made  by 
associated  bodies  of  mill-hands,  fortifying  the  monopoly  of  capital  by  the 
monopoly  of  combination,  and  dictating  terms  as  an  Associated  body." 

Now,  is  it  not  a  very  curious  fact,  that this  scheme,  of which I informed 
you about two  months  ago,  has,  to  this  very  moment,  never been alluded to 
25  by  the  London  papers,  although  silently  carried  out in  the  meantime,  and 
already  doing  its  work  at  Preston,  Bolton  and  Manchester?  The  London 
press, it appears, was  anxious to withhold the fact from the eyes of the world, 
that  the  Factory  Lords  were  systematically  arraying  their  class  against the 
class  of Labor,  and that the  successive  steps  taken by them, instead of being 
the  spontaneous  result  of  circumstances,  are  the  premeditated  effects of  a 
deep-laid  conspiracy  of  an  organized  Anti-Labor  League!  This  English 
Capitalist  League  of  the  Nineteenth  century  is  yet  to  find  its  historian,  as 
the  French  Catholic League  did in the  authors  of  the  Satyre Ménippée at the 
end  of  the  Sixteenth  century.

The workpeople, in order to  succeed in their demands, must naturally try 
to  keep  the  one  party  in  till  the  strike  of  the  others  has  proved  victorious. 
Where this plan is acted upon, the millowners combine to close all their mills, 
and,  thus,  to  drive  their  hands  to  extremities.  The  Preston  manufacturers, 
as  you know, were to begin the game. Thirteen mills are already closed, and, 
at the  expiration  of  another  week,  every  mill is to be  shut up, throwing out 
of  work  more  than 24,000 men.  The  weavers  have  addressed  a memorial  to 

447 

Karl  Marx 

the masters,  soliciting an interview,  or offering to refer the matters in dispute 
to  arbitration,  but  their  request  was  rejected.  As  the  Preston  weavers  are 
assisted  by  penny  collections  from  the  operatives  of  the  surrounding  dis 
tricts,  from  Stalybridge,  Oldham,  Stockport,  Bury,  Withnell,  Blackburn, 
Church-Parish, Ashton, Irvell-Vale, Enfield, Burnley, Colne, Bacup, etc. ; the 
men  having  discovered that  the  only  means  of  resisting the undue influence 
of  capital,  was  by  union  among  themselves;  the  Preston  factory-lords,  on 
their  part,  have  sent out  secret emissaries to undermine the means of  succor 
for the men on strike, and to induce the millo wner s of Burnley, Colne, Bacup, 
etc.,  to  close  their establishments,  and to  cause a general cessation of labor. 
In certain places, as  at Enfield, the overlookers have been induced to inform 
their  masters,  who  had  taken  a  part  in  forwarding  the  movement,  and  ac 
cordingly  a  number  of  penny  collectors  have  been  discharged.  While  the 
Preston  men  are  exhorted  by  the  workpeople  of  the  surrounding  districts 
to  remain  firm  and  united,  the  Preston  masters  meet  with  an immense  ap 
plause  from  the  other  manufacturers,  being  extolled  as  the  true  heroes  of 
the  age. 

At  Bury,  matters  are  taking  a  similar  turn  as  at  Preston.  At  Bolton,  the 
bedquilt  makers  having  lots  cast  to  decide  which  of  them  were  to  begin 
striking,  the  masters  of  the  whole  trade  at  once  closed  their  mills. 

Besides  the  simultaneous closing of mills, other means of combination are 
resorted to.  At  Keighly,  for instance, the weavers of Mr. Lund struck for an 
advance  of wages, the principal cause  of  their turn-out being his  giving less 
than was received by the weavers of Mr. Anderton,  at Bingley.  A deputation 
of  the  weavers  having  asked for an interview with Mr. Lund, and proceeded 
to  his  lodgings,  they  had  the  door  politely  shut  in  their  faces.  But,  a  week 
afterward,  Mr. Anderton's  work-people  were  informed  by  notice  that  a 
reduction  would  be  made  in the wages  of his  weavers  of  3d.  per piece,  and 
of  his woolcombers  of  one farthing per pound,  Mr. Lund  and  Mr. Anderton 
having, in the meantime, concluded an alliance offensive and defensive, with 
a view to fight the weavers of the one by pulling down the wages of the other. 
Thus,  it  is  supposed,  Mr. Lund's  weavers  will  be  driven  to  submission  or 
Mr. Anderton's  weavers  to  a  turn-out,  and the  additional weight of  another 
turn-out  doing  away  with  all  chance  of  support,  both  sets  will  bend  to  a 
general  reduction. 

In  other  instances  the  masters  try  to  enlist  the  shopkeepers  against  the 
working  men.  Thus  Mr. Horsfall,  the  coal  king  of  Darlymain pit,  when,  in 
consequence  of  a  reduction  of  wages,  his  hands  struck,  went  to  all  the 
butchers, bakers  and provision dealers  of the neighborhood the colliers trade 
with,  to  prevail  on  them  not  to  let  his  men  have  anything  on  credit. 

In all localities where the association for "regulating the excitement among 

448 

The  War  Question—Financial  Matters—Strikes 

the  operatives"  exists,  the  associated  masters  have  pledged  themselves  to 
heavy  fines,  in  case  of  any  individual  member  violating  the  status  of  their 
League,  or  yielding  to  the  demands  of  the  "hands."  At  Manchester  these 
fines  amount  to  £5,000,  at  Preston  to  £3,000,  at  Bolton  to  £2,000,  etc. 

5 

There  is  one  feature  which,  above  all,  distinguishes  the  present conflict 
from  past  ones.  At  former  periods—as  in  1832,  1839,  1840,1842—a general 
holiday,  as  it  was  called, viz.:  a general  and  simultaneous  stopping of labor 
throughout the  whole  kingdom,  was  a favorite  idea  with the operatives,  and 
the  great  object  they  aimed  at.  This  time,  it  is  capital  which  threatens  a 
10  general withdrawal.  It is the  masters who endeavor to bring about a general 
closing  of  mills.  Do  you  not  thmk  that,  if  successful,  it  may  prove  a  very 
dangerous  experiment?  Is  it their intention to  drive the English people to an 
insurrection  of  June,  in  order  to  break  their  rising  spirit,  and  to  lay  them 
prostrate  for  a  series  of  years  to  come? 

15 

At  all  events, we  cannot too  closely watch the  symptoms of the civil war 
preparing  in England,  especially  as the  London press  intentionally  shuts  its 
eyes to great facts, while it diverts its readers with descriptions of such trifles 
as  the  banquet  given  by  Mr. Titus  Salt,  one  of the factory princes  of York 
shire,  at the  opening of  his  palace-mill, where  not only the local aristocracy 
20  were  regaled,  but his  hands,  too.  "Prosperity,  health,  and happiness  to the 
working  class,"  was  the  toast  proposed  by  him,  as  the public  is  told by the 
Metropolitan press, but it is not told, that,  some days afterwards, his moreen 
weavers  received  notice  of  another  reduction  in  their  wages  from  2s.  3d. 
to  2s.  Id.  "If  this  means  either  health  or  prosperity  to  the  moreen  wea-
25  vers,"  writes  one  of  his  victims  to  The  People's  Paper,  "I,  for  one,  do  not 

want  it." 

You  will  perhaps  have  seen  from  The  Times  that  a  Mrs. MacDonnell,  of 
Knoydart,  Glengarry, has,  in imitation of the Duchess of Sutherland, under 
taken  to  clear  her  estates,  in  order  to  replace  men  by  sheep.  The  People's 
30  Paper, informed by  a correspondent on the  spot, gives the following graphic 

description  of  this  Malthusian  operation: 

"This lady had a number of cottagers on her domains, many of whom were 
unable  to pay their rents—some being considerably in arrears,  as  we are told. 
She,  therefore,  ordered  them  all  off,  and  drove  them  to  take  refuge  in  the 
35  woods  and caves, where they have since been lurking, or rather dying, while 
Mrs. MacDonnell's  horses have been warmly bedded in secure  and comfort 
able  dwellings.  She  at the  same  time offered them a free passage to Canada, 
passage  money  being  cheaper  than  poor  rolls,  and  permission  to  sell  'their 
little  stocks,'  they having no  stock whatever to  sell,  except the  clothes they 
stand  in,  a  broken table,  or  a rheumatic  cat.  Finally,  she  forgave  them  the 
arrears—she  could  not  get.  This  is  called  noble  generosity'."

Such  ejections  appear  to  be  again  the  order  of  the  day,  throughout  the 
Highlands. Thus, at least, we are informed by Sir Charles Forbes, a Highland 
laird, writing to  The  Times, "that sheep-farms are now becoming so valuable, 
that  it  will  pay  our  English  sheep-farmers  to  hire  ships  at  any  time,  and to 
pay for  the  removal  of  all  who  stand  in  their  way."

From  our  own  Correspondent. 

New-York  Daily  Tribune. 
Nr. 3912,  31. Oktober  1853 

London,  Tuesday,  October  18,  1853. 

The  Turkish  manifesto  addressed  on  the  first  of  October to  the four  Great 
Powers  as  a justification  of  the Sultan's declaration of war against the Czar, 
is,  in every respect, superior to the huge mass of state papers, which Europe 
has  been inundated  with  since  May,  1853. 

5 

The  Sultan,  it  states,  has  given no  motive for quarrel. There remained not 
even  a  pretext for it,  after the question of the  Holy Shrines had been  settled. 
On  the  part  of  Russia  all  treaties  were  infringed;  on  the  part  of  Turkey all 
10  means  of  conciliation  exhausted.  According  to  the Powers themselves, the 
Sultan was  not  to  subscribe to  Prince  Menchikoff's  note.  How,  then,  could 
he be expected to adopt the Vienna note, which, as a whole, was not different 
from  that  of  Prince  Menchikoff?  The  explanatory  epistle  of  the  Vienna 
conference  could  not  change  the  condition  of  affairs.  The  clear and  precise 
15  paragraph  of  the  Treaty  of  Kainardji  being  misconstrued  by  Russia,  what 
would not be the  risk  of "placing in her hands  vague and  obscure paragraphs 
affording  her  a  solid pretext for her pretentions  to  a religious Protectorate?" 
Moreover,  the  modifications  proposed by the Sultan have been fully justified 
by  the  subsequent  explanations  published  by  Nessehode.  The  occupation 
20  of the Principahties had, at first sight, constituted a casus belli, and the Porte 
is  now  decided  to  proclaim  it  a  casus  belli.  Prince  Gorchakoff  has,  ac 
cordingly,  been  summoned  to  evacuate  the  Danubian  provinces.  If  fifteen 
days  after  the  arrival  of  that  notification  he  should  answer  in the  negative, 
Omer  Pasha  is  to  commence  hostilities,  the  Russian  agents  are  to  quit  the 
25  Ottoman  states,  and  the  commercial  relations  of  the  two  countries  to  be 
broken  off.  No  embargo,  however,  will  be  laid  upon  Russian  merchant 
vessels,  but  they  will  receive  orders  to  leave  the  Turkish ports.  The  straits 
will  remain  open  to  the  mercantile  navy  of  friendly  Powers. 

Such  is  the  substance  of  the  Sultan's  manifesto. 

451 

Karl  Marx 

The Turkish vjltimatum was intimated to Prince Gorchakof f on the 9th inst. 
Accordingly,  the  term  for  evacuating  the  Principalities  expires  on  the 25th 
inst.  The  threat,  however,  of  commencing  hostilities  cannot be understood 
in a literal sense, as Omer Pasha is certain not to abandon his strong positions, 
with a view  to  attacking the  Russians. 

In  The  Morning Herald of  yesterday  you will  find  confirmed  my  observa 
tions  on  the  westward  movement  of  the  Russian  Army,  and  the  secret 
understanding  with  Austria  which  this  movement  indicates. 

5 

Russia,  true  to  the  old  Asiatic  system  of  cheating  and  petty  tricks,  now 
plays  upon the credulity  of the  Western World by  spreading the rumor that  10 
the  Czar  had  "just  sent  a  courier  in  all haste  to  Vienna  to  declare  that  he 
accepted  freely  and  completely  the whole of the  conditions proposed by the 
mediating powers," when, unfortunately,  "he became informed of the decla 
ration  of  war  on  the  side  of  the  Porte."  Then,  of  course,  the  God  of  the 
Russians  retracted  at  once  all  the  concessions  he  had  ever  made,  and  ex- 
claimed  that  "nothing  remained  but  war,  and  war  to  the  knife,"  (guerre  à 
l'outrance.)  Thus  the  Czar,  it  appears,  has  been  forced  into  war  by  the 
Sultan. 

15 

Mr. de  Brack,  the  Austrian  Internuncio,  is  said  to  have  interrogated  the 
Porte  whether it intended to  appeal to the political refugees in order to form  20 
a  foreign  legion.  Redchid  Pasha  replied  that,  notwithstanding  the  proposi 
tions  incessantly  made  to  the  Porte,  he  had  not  yet  come  to  any  decision; 
but  that  in  the  case  of  Turkey  being  abandoned  by  her  allies,  she  would 
believe  herself  perfectly justified  in  making use  of  all  means  for her proper 
defense, and in employing the  services of the political refugees disseminated  25 
throughout  the  several  countries  of  Europe. 

We  read in the  Constitutionnel:  "We have reason to believe  that there  has 
arrived at this  moment at Paris and London an official demand for the succor 
of  France  and  England  on  the  part  of  the  Sublime  Porte." 

You will read  in the  newspapers  that the Emperor of Austria has reduced  30 

his  army  by  about  100,000  men.  The  truth  is  that  this  number  have  been 
dismissed  on  furlough,  but  are  revocable  at  any  moment.  The  financial 
pressure  on the  one  side,  and the  hope  of thus  catching the  money-lenders 
on  the  other,  have  induced  the  Vienna  Cabinet  to  take  this  step. 

The following extract from a London commercial circular, concerning the  35 

Corn-trajde  of  France,  will,  I  suppose,  be  read  with  interest: 

"From  a  very  extensive  correspondence  taking  every possible  trouble  to 
ascertain the  real  state  of  the  case,  we believe the  crop  of wheat in France 
to  be  on  an  average  fully one-third  short, varying according to  locality, the 
greatest  deficiency  being  in  the  south.  It  is  true  that  journals  under  the  40 
influence  of  the  Government  have  endeavored  to  persuade  the  public  that 

452 

The  Turkish  Manifesto—France's  Economic  Position 

10 

such  is  not  the  case,  but  the  very  acts  of  the  Government  are  a  sufficient 
contradiction to such assertions. It first relaxed the Navigation Laws inf avor 
of  this  country;  it  then  repealed  them  altogether;  next  it  anticipated  the 
reduction  of  the  duty,  which the  shding-scale  would  of  itself  have  secured, 
5  by  fixing  it  at  the  minimum  (without  reference  to  the  sections  into  which 
France  is  divided  at  various  rates  of  duty)  and  opened the ports  to foreign 
vessels free of tunnage dues. Since then it has opened all the rivers and canals 
free  to  corn  vessels,  and  invited  the  railways  to  carry  the  food  at  reduced 
rates;  it  has  opened  Algeria  free,  and  allowed  it  to  ship  to  France  by  any 
tunnage; it has prohibited the export of potatoes and vegetables, and has not 
hesitated to interfere  arbitrarily in many markets between buyers and sellers. 
Surely  all  this  confirms  a  short  crop,  or  are  very unnecessary precautions. 
The trade in France has, however, been in a state of suspense for some time; 
not  that  the  merchants  throughout  the  kingdom  have  any  doubt  as  to  the 
result of the harvest,  but the  false  step which the Government adopted with 
regard to fixing the price of bread has  so perplexed them that they have been 
afraid to  act,  and it is  notorious that as  soon as  the  decree  was  issued, tele 
graphs  were  sent  off  in  all  directions,  cancelling  the  orders  given for  corn; 
and  it is impossible to  estimate the ultimate  consequence this  measure  may 
20  have  upon prices.  The  average  production  of  wheat  in France is  estimated 
at  80 millions  of hectolitres,  (about 28  millions  qrs.,) the highest production 
during  the  last  25  years  having  been  97  millions  in  1847,  and  the  lowest 
52  millions  in  1830.  The  growth  of  wheat  has  increased  very  much  of  late 
years, much faster in proportion than the population; and the fact that stocks 
25 are completely exhausted at the present time, shows that the population have 
been much better  fed  and  in  a more  prosperous  condition than they used to 
be.

will  cause  the  effect  of  a bad  harvest to  be  more  severely  felt,  as  there  are

in  warehouse."

The  sinister  intentions  of  the  governing  classes  of  England,  with  regard 
to  Turkey,  may  be inferred from the  sermons of Messrs.  Bright and Cobden 
at Edinburgh, from the Gladstone speeches at Manchester, and from the hint, 
thrown  out by  several papers, that, in the case of a Russo-Turkish war, Lord 
Aberdeen will be  replaced by Lord Palmerston, the  chivalrous  antagonist of 
Russia. 

Jail Inquiries  are  now  a constant feature in the reports of the press. From 
what  has  been  disclosed  it  appears  that  prison  discipline  in  Birmingham 
consists  of  collars  and  mural  torture;  in  Leicestershire  of  cranks,  and  in 
Hampshire  of  the  less  artificial  method  of  starvation.  And  "you  call this  a 
free  country!" 

I stated, in a former letter, that the so-called peace concluded with Burmah, 
was  but  an  armistice,  and that the  new  acquisitions  would prove  an  endless 
source  of  new  troubles  to  the  British  conquerors.  The  last  overland  mail 
informs  us,  indeed,  that  the  war  party  in  Burmah  is  increasing in  strength; 
that  the  new  territories  are  literally  overrun  by  large  bands  of  robbers,  in 
stigated  by  the  Government  of  Ava  and  requiring  a  considerable  increase 
of military force at Prome, and that "the British troops are sick and disgusted, 
healthy  sites  for  barracks  having  not  yet  been  discovered." 

The  shameful  neglect  of  all  means  of  irrigation  on  the  part  of  the  Indo-
British  rulers,  is  again  producing,  in  the  district  of  Patna,  its  regular  quota 
of  Cholera  and  famine,  consequent  on  the  long  continued  drouth.

Movements  of the  Armies in Turkey. 

5 

Several  important military movements  have  recently taken place in the  seat 
of  war  in  Turkey,  which  more  clearly  define the positions  and plans  of the 
respective  parties.  The  Russians—to  whom  we first  advert because  they are 
the  attacking  party,  and  as  such  must be  regarded  as  taking  the initiative-
have  continued  to  extend  their line  of  operations  toward the  West.  Brigade 
after brigade  has  been sent in the direction of Widdin, on the upper Danube; 
and  now  the  front  of  the  Russian  army  may be  said  to extend from Kalafat, 
opposite  Widdin,  to  Orash,  opposite  Hirsova,  in  a  direction  which  equally 
10  menaces  the road  to  Constantinople, and that to Servia and Macedonia. The 
first  movement  toward  Kalaf  at  was  sufficient  to  establish  the  certainty  of 
a Russian diversion toward the centers of the Slavonic and Greek population 
of Turkey.  It made it probable, at the same time, that the plan of the campaign 
would  be  defensive  action  and  mere  demonstrations  on  the  direct  road  to 
15  Constantinople,  with  energetic  offensive  action  on  the  road  to  Sofia,  in 
Servia  and  Macedonia.  However,  when  these  movements  were  made,  the 
Turks  had  not  declared  war.  This  event has  since taken place,  and appears 
to  have  irritated  the  Czar  to  such  a  degree  that  he  is  likely  to  impart  a  far 
more  energetic  impulse  to  his  troops  than  was  previously  to  be  expected. 
20  Not only is Prince Paskiewich called  to the command of the Russian forces, 
but he  is  also  said to bring with him 40,000 soldiers from the army in Poland, 
who  next to  the guards  and grenadiers,  are considered the best troops in the 
Russian  pay.  Such  reenforcements  would  establish  a  superiority  for  the 
Russian  arms  which  might  justify  offensive  action,  both  on the  Upper  and 
25 Lower Danube, while at the same time they might be considered as a counter 
poise  against  any  French  and  British forces,  that,  according  to  rumor,  are 
likely  to  be  sent  to  the  support  of  Turkey.  At  all  events,  these  Russian 
reenforcements  cannot  arrive  on  the  Danube  in  time  for  operations  this 
season.  From  Warsaw  to  Bucharest,  by  way  of  Dubno,  Chotin  and  Jassy, 

455

the distance is eight hundred miles across  a country in which an army cannot 
move  more than eight or ten  mues  a day.  It will then be  three  months  or till 
the  beginning  of  January  before  these  fresh  troops  can  take  up  their  posi 
tions;  and considering the  season of the year,  it is  even probable that it will 
take  them  longer.  These  troops,  then,  must  remain  entirely  in  the  background  5 
until  the  beginning  of  the  spring  campaign. 

The Russian forces, now in the Principalities, have been estimated at from 
130,000 to  150,000  men.  Supposing they have  lost by sickness and desertion 
from  20,000  to  30,000,  they  still  maintain  a  numerical  superiority  over  the 
Turks opposed to them. For if we know but little more of the actual strength 1 o 
of  the  Russians  than  what  may be  concluded  from  the  number  of  divisions 
and  brigades  marched  into  Turkey,  and  from  the  effective  numbers  they 
ought to  show  on their rolls, the numbers of the Turkish forces on the Danube 
are very well known through the reports of British,  French and Piedmontese 
officers  sent there by their respective  Governments.  Now,  all these reports  15 
agree  in this  fact,  that  even  after  the  arrival of  the  Egyptian contingent,  the 
Turkish  active  army,  under  Omer  Pasha,  did  not  number  more  than 
110,000  combatants,  of  whom  only  80,000  were  regulars.  Behind them,  at 
Adrianople,  an  army  of  reserve  was  being  formed  which was  to  consist of 
80,000  Redif  s,  (old  soldiers  called  in  again,)  but  of  the  state  of  this  reserve,  20 
we have no positive information. The fact, then, is this, that on the day when 
the  first  shot  will  be  fired,  Omer  Pasha will  command  an  army  numerically 
inferior  to  that  of  his  opponent,  and  that  nothing  but  blunders  on  the  part 
of  his  enemy,  or  capital  generalship  on  his  own  part,  will  save  him  from 
defeat. 

25 

We  have  equally  good  information  as  to  the  position  and  the  defensive 
preparations of the Turks. Three lines have been fortified:  first, the Danube, 
to prevent its being passed by the enemy;  second, that from Varna to  Shumla; 
third, that a few leagues in the rear of the second, on the river Kamesik, where 
is  the  fort  which  guards  the  passes  of  the  Balkan.  These  fortifications  are  30 
described  by  the  foreign  officers  as  formidable,  and  likely  to  frustate  any 
attempt of  an enemy to  carry them.  Now, with all respect for the important 
art  of  field-fortification,  and  for  the  judgment  of the  officers  who  give this 
report,  we  may  be  allowed  to  say  that  such opinions  must be  received with 
great  caution.  How  many  field-works  considered  to  be  impregnable  have  35 
been carried,  after  a few  rounds  of  grape-shot,  on  the first assault; and who 
does  not  know  that  the  most  celebrated  field-works  ever  constructed,  the 
lines  of  Torres  Vedras,  were  strong,  not  by  their  passive  capacity  of  re 
sistance  but  because  Wellington  had  100,000  men  to  defend  them,  while 
Masséna  could  only bring  30,000 men to the  attack?  Single, detached field-  40 
works,  as  in  mountain  passes  for  instance,  have  often  done  great  service; 

456 

Movements of the Armies  in Turkey 

but  never  in  modern  times  has  a  superior  army,  commanded  by  an  able 
General,  been  defeated  in  a  general  action  on  account  of  the  passive  re 
sistance  offered  by  field-works.  And  then  the  manner  in which field-works 
are  defended  is  almost  everything;  but  half  disciplined  troops,  or  soldiers 
5  without any discipline, are of little avail behind breastworks when a vigorous 

shower  of  grape  is  directed  upon  them. 

But  let us  look at the  three  lines  of  defense  the  Turks  have  fortified.  The 
first  is  that  of  the  Danube.  Now,  to  fortify  the  line  of the  Danube  can only 
mean  to  erect  such  works  as  will  prevent  the  Russians  from  crossing  that 
river.  The course of the Danube, from Orsova to the sea, is nearly 600 miles 
long;  to  fortify such a line effectually and to garrison the fortifications, would 
require  six  times  as  many  men  as  the  Turkish  General  can  command,  and 
if he  had  them  he  would  commit the  greatest blunder  should  he  put them to 
such  a  use.  We  conclude  then  that  this  first  Une  of  fortifications  must be 
confined  to works  between Rustchuk  and  Hirsova,  by which the passage of 
the  river  is  molested,  but  not  effectually  prevented. 

10 

15 

The  second  position  from  Shumla  to  Varna  is  exactly  the  same  in which 
the  Turks  were  routed  in  1829,  and  in  which  they  are  again  sure  to  be  an 
nihilated  if  they  there  accept  a  decisive  battle.  The  position  appears  to 
20  possess  striking  advantages  for  defense,  and  to  be  susceptible  of  great 
additional  strength  by  art;  and  the  position  on  the  Kamesik,  to  the  rear  of 
Varna  and  Shumla,  appears  to  be  stiU  stronger,  and  has  the  advantage  of 
forcing  the  enemy  to  leave  troops behind to  blockade  those  fortresses.  But 
both  have  this  disadvantage,  that  they  have  a  narrow  pass  in  their  rear  as 
the  only  means  of  retreat,  which  outweighs,  for  an inferior  army,  aU other 
advantages,  and which would make it an egregious  mistake to accept abattle 
unless  the  inferior  army  were  as  sure  as  the  British were  at  Waterloo  that 
at  the  decisive  moment  an  aUied  army  would  faU  upon  the  flanks  of  the 
attacking  enemy. 

25 

30 

35 

40 

As  to  Omer  Pasha  we  have  no  means  of  judging  to  what  use  he  reaUy 
intends turning these fortifications.  We  can not doubt but he knows very well 
that  his  part  in  the  war  will  be  chiefly  defensive;  and  he  is,  therefore, per 
fectly justified in  strengthening his  defensive position by all the means which 
the  art  of  fortification places  at  his  disposal.  We  do  not  know,  whether he 
intends these fortifications to frighten the Russians from passing the Danube 
at those points by which Constantinople is most directly menaced or whether 
he proposes to accept a decisive battle in them.  It is  said that he has disposed 
his  army in  such a manner that at whatever point toward Shumla the Russians 
shaU cross the river, he will be prepared to f aU upon the head of their main 
column  and  beat  it before  support  can  arrive.  In  that case,  the  second line 
of  fortifications  would  form  a  secure  retreat  if  the  operation  should  be 

457 

Friedrich  Engels 

5 

frustrated.  But  the  truth  is  that  a great  defensive  battle  on  any  of  the  three 
lines  would  be  a  mistake;  for  either  the  Russians  will  concentrate  all  their 
forces  for  the  attack,  and  then Omer  Pasha will  stand  but  a poor chance; or 
they  will  divide  themselves,  and  then he  ought to  leave  his  fortified Unes  in 
order to  fall upon one of their  columns.  The best use to which he could turn 
these  fortifications,  and the  only  one  consistent with the  modern  system of 
warfare  would  be  to  use  them  as  a provisional base for offensive operations 
against  detached  Russian  columns,  on  their  passing  the  Danube;  to  check 
the  Russian  advance  by  a  more  or  less  obstinate  defense  of  each line;  and 
to hold, by means of the third line, the  most important passes of the Balkan  10 
as  long  as  this  can be  done  without a general  engagement.  At the  same time 
it  cannot be  denied that  any  army,  and particularly the Turkish army, would 
be  exceedingly  demoralized  by  the  abandonment  without a battle,  of  these 
fortifications;  for  if  they  cannot hold  out behind  ditches and bulwarks, how 
are  they  to  beat  the  Russians  in  the  open field? This is the way the private  15 
soldier  always  reasons,  especially  if  only  half  disciplined;  and therefore, if 
the  fortifications  in  question  actually have the importance ascribed to them, 
we  cannot but consider them  more  dangerous  to  the  Turks  themselves than 
to  the  Russians. 

But the Russians have fortified themselves, too, in Wallachia? Certainly,  20 

and  their  case  is  different.  They  are  the  attacking  party;  their fortifications 
merely  serve  to  cover  retreat  and check pursuit in case of disaster; and they 
have four Unes  of rivers,  one behind the  other,  crossing their line of retreat, 
and  forming  as  many  lines  of  defense.  These  lines  are,  the  Danube,  the 
Ardgish,  the  Buseo  and  the  Sereth.  Here  is  a  fair  case  for  precautionary  25 
fortifications;  here  are  natural  lines  of  defense  which  form, to  a European 
army,  no  obstacle  for retreat,  while  with  a little  artificial improvement they 
may  become  serious  obstacles  to  pursuit;  and  above all, here is no intention 
of  accepting  a  general  battle  with  only  one  line  of  retreat  in  the  rear.  The 
Russian  fortifications,  as  far  as  we  can  judge,  belong  decidedly  to  the  30 
European  system  of  warfare,  while  the  Asiatic  spirit  predominates  in those 
of  the  Turks.  This  same  unreflecting  character  is  the  ruling  feature  of  the 
general  position  of the  latter.  They  defend  Constantinople  by  placing them 
selves  across  the  nearest  road  which  leads  to  it, while  the  Russians  appear 
to  direct  their  first  attack,  not  upon  that  city,  but upon the  central parts  of  35 
the  peninsula, where  Turkish  dominion  is  most vulnerable, and where, after 
all,  for  a  Russian  army,  lies  the  shortest  way  to  the  capital. 

There  is,  however, one thing which we must not forget.  The Russian army 
is,  and  ever  has  been,  slow  and  cautious  in  its  movements.  It  will  most 
probably not  act during the winter  season. A few  skirmishes may take place  40 
in order to  secure this or that island of the Danube to either party. But unless 

458 

Movements  of  the  Armies  in  Turkey 

the  Czar  commands  extraordinary  activity—which  command  would  most 
likely be  frustrated by the passive pedantry of his generals—there is very little 
chance  of  decisive  maneuvers  before  spring.  The  Danube  might be  passed 
but  the  Balkan  cannot  be  traversed,  and  between  the  two,  the  position  of 
the  Russian  army would  be  most  dangerous. 

5 

In the  meantime, the  Turks  have  sent their fleet to Varna. Admiral Slade, 
an  Englishman,  who  commands  it,  appears  to  be  in  high  spirits.  But  that 
movement, too,  is full  of risk.  The Russian fleet,  indeed, appears inferior to 
the  Turkish in everything but numbers; but as long as the Russians have two 
10  guns  and two  ships of the line to  one of the Turks, the latter cannot venture 
an  action out of the reach of their  strand batteries.  And in that case, the fleet 
would be  safer  and better placed  in the  Bosphorus, where it is not likely the 
Russians  will blockade it.  Once  at Varna,  the Turkish fleet is  exposed to be 
deprived  of  all  possibility  of  movement;  while  in  the  Bosphorus,  it  retains 
its  freedom  of  action,  and  might  be  used for expeditions  to  Trebizond,  to 
the  Caucasian  coast,  or  against  detached  positions  of  the  Russian  fleet. 

15 

In  every  respect,  then,  we  are  unwillingly  compelled  to  believe the  Rus 
sians to be superior to the Turks. Whether Omer Pasha, who is really an able 
soldier,  will  succeed  by  his  personal  qualities  in  changing  the  balance,  re-
20  mains  to  be  seen.  Old  Paskiewich,  however,  although  a  slow,  is  an  ex 

perienced  general,  and  will  not  easily  be  caught.

Among  the  arrests  recently  made  at  Paris,  the  most  important  is  that  of 
M. Delescluze,  private  Secretary  to  M. Ledra  Rollin.  He  had  been  sent  to 
Paris on a secret mission,  and compromising papers, as is  stated, have been 
seized upon him.  One cannot understand M. Ledra Rollin's trusting to  a man

At Copenhagen the  consummation  of  the  coup  d'état  seems  imminent, as 
the Ministry will not yield, and as the Folkething has pronounced against the 1 o 
abolition of the existing Constitution, unless the Government submit to them 
its  own  project  of  a  Constitution  for the  whole  Danish  monarchy.  The  two 
separate  projects  for  the  Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein have appeared. 
They  are  poor  imitations  of  the  constitutions  of the  old Prussian  Provincial 
Diets,  distributing  the  representation  among  the  several  "orders,"  making  15 
the right of election dependent on the holding of landed property, and limiting 
its  exercise  by  the  condition  of  "domicile"  in  the  respective  electoral  dis 
tricts.  The  most  remarkable  paragraphs  in  these  constitutions  are  two,  one 
of  which  deprives  the  courts  of  law  of  their  ancient  right  of  canceling  ad 
ministrative  decrees,  and  the  other  excluding  all  individuals  from the right  20 
of  voting  who  compromised  themselves  in  the  revolutionary  struggle  from 
1848-50,  whether  they  have  since  been  amnestied  or  not. 

I  told  you  in  my last letter that the Austrian decree reducing the army was 
intended  merely  to  entrap  the  money-lenders;  and  now  that  all  chance  of 
obtaining  a loan has  vanished—now  that the Government declare they never  25 
intended  to  contract  any  loan—now  that  they  have  entered  upon  a  fresh 
emission  of  paper,  we  are  informed  that  "no  arrangements  are being made 
for  carrying  into  execution  the  Imperial  decree  relative to  the  reduction of 
the  army,  and that, on the contrary, the generals who command in Lombardy, 

460 

Arrest of  Delescluze—Denmark—Austria—"The  Times"  on  the  Prospects  of War against  Russia 

Hungary,  and  Croatia,  have,  all  of  them,  demanded  re-enforcements  on 
account  of  the  state  of  the  public  mind  in  those  countries." 

A  Paris  correspondent  writes  as  follows  to  The  Morning  Post  with 
reference  to  the  proceedings  of  the  Emperor  of  Russia during his  late visits 
to  Olmiitz  and  Berlin: 

5 

"The  Czar's  chief  object was  to make a new alliance between the Northern 
P o w e r s . .. To overcome the resistance of Prussia he used every argument—I 
may  say  every  bribe;  for  he  offered,  on the  event of  his  advancing into  and 
holding Turkish territory, to yield the occupation of Warsaw and the military 

10  dominion  of  Poland  to  Prussia." 

As  to  the  reported  successes  of  the  Russians  over  Schamyl, letters  have 
arrived  at  Paris  which  show  them  to  be  nothing  but  inventions,  no  en 
gagement  of  any  description  having  taken  place  in  the  Caucasus  since  the 
month of  May, when the victory at Mendoh was gained by Schamyl,  and the 

15  Russians  were  driven back from  their  attempts  upon  Malka. 

"We  quite  understand  the  popularity  of  a  war  with  Russia  on  behalf  of 
the Poles or the Hungarians, even if there was no ground of our interference, 
except  political  sympathy  . ..  We  do  not understand  a war  on behalf  of  the 
Turk." 

20 

Thus  wrote  The  Times on  Oct.  12.  A  week later  we are told by the  same 

paper: 

"The  first  collision between British  and  Russian  armies  would be a signal 
of  revolution  all  over  the  Continent,  and  we  think it by no  means unlikely, 
nor,  indeed,  altogether  objectionable,  that  such  a  consideration may  have 
25  occasionally  passed through the  minds  of our aristocratic, plutocratic,  des 
potic,  and  anything  but  democratic  rulers  . ..  We  are  deliberately  to  go  to 
war  with  Russia,  in  defense  of the Turkish nominal sovereignty over certain 
really  independent provinces,  because by so  doing we  shall provoke a rebel 
lion in the Austrian Empire. " One day England is not to go to war with Russia, 
30  because  by  so  doing  it  would  defend  the  Turks,  instead  of  the  Poles  and 
Hungarians;  and  the  next  day  because  any  war  in  behalf  of  Turkey  would 
be  simultaneously  a  war  in  behalf  of  the  Poles  and  the  Hungarians. 

35 

The  Vienna  Presse  states  that Abd-el-Kader  has been asked by the  Sultan 
to  accept  a military  command  in the  case of a war with Russia. The negotia-
tions were managed by the Sheik-ul-Islam, and the Emir declared his willing 
ness  to  enter  the  service  of  Turkey  on  the  condition  that  the  advice  of 
Bonaparte  was  previously  asked.  The  command  destined  for  him  was  that 
of  the  Asiatic  army.

The Holy War. 

The  war  has  at last opened  on  the  Danube,—a war of religious fanaticism on 
both  sides,  of  traditional  ambition with the  Russians,  of life  and death with 
the Turks.  As  was  to  have  been expected,  Omer Pasha  has  been the  first to 
begin positive hostilities;  it was in the line of his duty to make some demon- 
stration  toward  the  forcible  expulsion  of  the  invaders  from  the  Ottoman 
territory;  but  it is by no means certain that he has thrown from thirty to fifty 
thousand  men  across  the  Danube,  as  is  rumored  from  Vienna,  and there  is 
reason  to  fear  that  if  he  has  done  so  he  has  committed  a fatal blunder.  On 
the  shore  he  leaves,  he  has  ample  resources  of defense and a good position; 
on the  shore  he  seeks  he  has  inferior power  of  attack  and  no  retreat in case 
of  disaster.  The  report of  his  crossing with  such numbers must therefore be 
doubted  till  more  positive  advices.

While  the  struggle  in  Europe  is  commenced  under  disadvantageous  cir 
cumstances for the Turks, the  case  is otherwise in Asia.  There, the frontier  15 
territories  of  Russia  and  Turkey  divide  themselves,  in  a  military  point 
of  view,  into  two  quite  distinct  theaters  of  operation.  It  is  the  high  ridge, 
or  rather  concatenation  of  ridges,  connecting  the  Caucasus  with  the  table 
land  of  Central  Armenia,  and  dividing the  waters  that  run toward the  Black 
Sea from  those which the Araxes leads to the Caspian Sea, or the Euphrates  20 
to  the  Persian  Gulf;  it  is  this  ridge  which  formerly  parted  Armenia  from 
Pontus,  that  now  forms  the  partition  of the two  distinct districts where  the 
war  is  to  be  waged.  This  range  of  abrupt  and  generally  barren  rocks,  is 
traversed  by  very  few  roads—the  two  principal  of  which  are  those  from 
Trebisond  and  Batum to  Erzerum.  Thus  for  all  military  purposes,  the  hills  25 
in  question may be  considered  as  nearly  impassable,  forcing both parties to 
have  distinct  corps  on  either  side,  operating  more  or  less  independently of 
each  other. 

The  country  on  the  shore  of  the  Black  Sea is  intersected by  a number  of 

462 

The  Holy  War 

rivers  and  mountain  torrents,  which  form  as  many  military  positions  for 
defense.  Both the  Russians  and  the  Turks  have  fortified  posts on important 
points.  In this generally broken country,  (the  valley  of the river Rioni is the 
only one which forms anything like a plain,) a defensive war might be carried 
5  on  with  great  success  against  a  superior  army,  (as  very  few  positions  are 
liable  to  be  turned  on  the  land  side,  on  account  of  the  mountains,)  were  it 
not  for  the  cooperation  of the  respective  fleets.  By advancing,  and,  in case 
of need, landing troops, upon the flank of the enemy, while the army engages 
him  in  front,  a  fleet  might  turn  all  these  strong  positions,  one  by  one,  and 
10  neutralize, if not destroy, fortifications which, on neither side of the frontier, 
are  very  respectable.  Thus  the  possession  of  the  Black  Sea  Coast  belongs 
to  him  who  is  master  of  the  Sea; or, in other words,  unless  the  allied  fleets 
cooperate  actively  with  the  Turks,  it  will  in  all  hkelihood  belong  to  the 
Russians. 

15 

The country in the interior, on the inland side of the mountains, comprises 
the  territory  in  which the  Euphrates,  the  Araxes  and  the  Kur  (Cyrus) take 
their  rise;  the  Turkish  province  of  Armenia  is  on  the  one,  the  Russian 
province  of  Georgia  on  the  other  side  of  the  frontier.  This  country,  too, is 
extremely  mountainous  and generally impassable to  armies.  Erzerum  on the 
20  part  of the  Turks,  Tiflis  on the  part  of the  Russians,  may  be  said to be the 
two  immediate  bases  of  operations,  with  the  loss  of  which  the  possession 
of the whole neighboring country would be inevitably lost. Thus the storming 
of  Erzerum  by  the  Russians  decided  the  Asiatic  campaign  of  1829. 

25 

30 

But  what  is  the  immediate  oasis  of  operation  for  one  party,  will  be  the 
direct object of operations to the other. Thus the roads connecting Tiflis and 
Erzeroum will be the lines of operations for both.  There are three roads; one 
by the upper Kur and Akhalzikhe, the other by the upper Araxes and Erivan, 
the  third  in  the  midst between  these  two,  across  the  mountains  by  way  of 
Kars.  All these roads are guarded on either side, by fortified towns and posts, 
and  it  would  be  difficult  to  say  which  would  be  for Turks  or Russians, the 
most eligible.  Suffice  it to  say that the  road  by Akhalzikhe  is  the one which 
would  lead  a Turkish army  most directly  upon the  insurgent districts  of  the 
Caucasus,  but that very  advance  of  the  Turks would be turned by a Russian 
corps  advancing  from  Batum  up  the  valley  of  the  Tchorokh  by  Olti  upon 
35  Erzerum; the road from Batum joins that from Tiflis only about 15  miles from 
Erzerum  which  would  enable  a  Russian  corps  advancing  in  the  direction 
alluded to,  to  cut off the communication of the Turks, and, if  strong enough, 
to  take  possession  even  of  Erzerum,  the  fortifications  of  which  are  of  a 
merely  Asiatic  character  and  not  capable  of  serious  resistance. 

40 

The key to the theater of war, in Asia, and on either side of the hills, then, 
is Batum, and considering this, as well as its commercial importance, we need 

463 

Friedrich  Engels 

not  wonder  at  the  efforts  the  Czar  has  always  been  making  to  get  hold  of 
it.  And  Batum  is  the  key  of  the  theater  of  war,  nay,  of  all  Turkey  in  Asia, 
because it commands the only passable road from the coast to the interior—a 
road  which  turns  all  the  Turkish  positions  in  advance  of  Erzerum.  And 
whichever  of  the  two  fleets  in  the  Black  Sea  drives  the  other  back into  its 
harbors,  that  fleet  commands  Batum.

The Russians are perfectly aware of the importance of this post. They have 
sent,  by  land  and  by  water,  reinforcements  to  the  Transcaucasian coast.  A 
short  time  ago  it  might  have  been  believed  that  the  Turks,  if  weaker  in 
Europe,  enjoyed a decided  superiority in Asia.  Abdi Pasha, who commands  10 
the  Asiatic  army,  was  said  to  have  collected  60,000  or  80,000,  nay 
120,000  men,  and  swarms  of  Bedouins,  Kurds  and  other  warlike  irregulars 
were  reported  to  flock  daily  to  his  standard.  Arms  and  ammunitions  were 
said  to  be  in  store  for  the  Caucasian  insurgents,  and  as  soon  as  war  was 
declared,  an  advance  was  to  be  made  into  the  very  heart  of  these  centres  15 
of  resistances  to  Russia.  It  may,  however,  be  as  well  to  observe  that Abdi 
Pasha  cannot possibly have  more  than  about  30,000 regular troops, and that 
before the Caucasus is reached, with these, and with these alone, he will have 
to  encounter the  stubborn resistance of Russian battalions. His Bedouins and 
Kurdish  horsemen  may  be  capital  for  mountain  warfare,  for  forcing  the  20 
Russians  to  detach largely  and  to  weaken  their  main  body;  they  may  do  a 
great  deal  of  damage  to  the  Georgian  and  Colonist  villages  in  the  Russian 
Territory,  and  even  open  some  sort  of  an  underhand  communication with 
the  Caucasian  mountaineers.  But  unless  Abdi  Pasha's  regulars  are  capable 
of  blocking  up  the  road  from  Batum  to  Erzerum,  and  can defeat whatever  25 
nucleus  of  an  active  army  the  Russians  may  be  enabled  to  bring  together, 
the  success  of the irregulars will be of a very ephemeral nature. The support 
of  a  regular  army  is  now-a-days  necessary  to  the  progress  of  all  in 
surrectionary  or  irregular  warfare  against  a  powerful  regular  army.  The 
position of the  Turks  on this  frontier would be  similar to  that of Wellington  30 
in Spain, and it remains to be  seen whether Abdi Pasha will know to husband 
his  resources  as  well  as  the  British general  did,  against  an enemy  decidedly 
his  superior  in  regular  warfare  and  the  means  of  carrying it on.  In  1829  the 
Russian forces  in Asia,  amounted,  before  Erzerum, to  18,000  men only, and 
considering the improvements that have since then taken place in the Turkish  35 
army,  (although  that  of  Asia  has  least  participated in them,)  we  should  say 
the  Russians  would  have  a  fair  chance  of  success  if  they  could  unite 
30,000  men  in  a  body  before  the  same  place  now. 

Whether  they  will  be  able  to  do  so  or  not, who  can decide  at the  present 
time,  when  there  is  even  less  of  real  facts  known,  and  more  idle  rumors  40 
spread  as  to  the  Russian  army  in  Asia,  than  as  to  that  in  Europe?  The 

464 

The  Holy  War 

Caucasian army is officially computed at200,000men, at its full complement; 
21,000  Cossacks  of  the  Black  Sea  have  been marched  toward  the  Turkish 
frontier;  several  divisions  are  said to  have been embarked from  Odessa for 
Redut  Kaleh,  on  the  South  Caucasian  coast.  But  every body knows  that the 
5  Caucasian  army  does  not count half its  official complement,  that the re-en 
forcement  sent beyond  the Caucasus cannot, from obvious causes, have the 
strength  reported  by  Russian  papers,  and from the  conflicting evidence  we 
receive, we  are  absolutely at a loss  to  make  anything like  an estimate of the 
Russian  forces  on  the  Asiatic  frontier.  But  that  we  may  say,  that  in  all 
10  probability the  forces  of both parties  (an immediate general insurrection of 
the  Caucasians  left  out  of the  question)  will be  pretty nearly  balanced,  that 
the  Turks  may,  perhaps,  be a little  stronger than the Russians, and therefore 
will  be,  on  this  theater  of  war,  justly  entitled  to  undertake  offensive opera 
tions. 

15 

The chances for the Turks  are, indeed, far more encouraging in Asia than 
in  Europe.  In  Asia  they  have  but  one  important  post to guard,  Batum;  and 
an advance, be it from Batum, or from Erzerum toward the Caucasus, opens 
to  them  in  case  of  success  a  direct  communication  with  their  allies,  the 
mountaineers,  and  may  at once  cut off  the  communication,  at least by land, 
20  of the Russian army  south of the  Caucasus with Russia; a result which may 
lead to the entire destruction of that army. On the other hand, if defeated, the 
Turks risk losing Batum, Trebisond and Erzerum; but even if that be the case, 
the  Russians  will  then  not  be  strong  enough  to  advance  any  further.  The 
advantages  are  far  superior  to  the  loss  to  be  undergone  in  case  of  defeat; 
and  it is therefore, for sound and satisfactory reasons, that the Turks appear 
to  have  decided  upon  offensive  warfare  in  those  regions.

Nr.3925,15. November  1853 

War—Strikes—Dearth. 

From  Our  Own  Correspondent. 

London, Tuesday, Nov. 1,  1853. 

The  news  of  the  cannonade  of  Isakchi  had  hardly  reached  London,  when 
the intelligence was  telegraphed from  Vienna to  London and Paris, that the 
Porte,  at  the  request  of  the  representatives  of  the  four  powers,  had  issued 
orders  for  the  adjournment of the hostilities, if they should not have already 
commenced,  till  the  1st  November.  Is  the  exchange  of  cannon-shots  at 
Isakchi  to  be  or  not  to  be  considered  as  a  commencement  of  hostilities? 
That is  the  question now  stirring  the  Stock Exchange and the press.  In my  10 
opinion  it  is  a  very  indifferent  one,  as  in  any  event  the  armistice  would 
have  elapsed  to-day.

It is rumored that the Turkish army had crossed the Danube at Widdin and 
Malchin,  viz.:  at  the  south-eastern  and  north-western frontiers  of  Bulgaria. 
The  accuracy  of this  dipatch appears  very doubtful.  According to the  Paris  15 
Presse of to-day,  it  was  resolved  by  a  military  council held in the  Seraskirat 
on  the  15th  or  16th  Oct.,  that  as  soon  as  the  refusal  of  Prince  Gorchakoff 
to  evacuate the  Principalities  would be officially known, the hostilities  were 
to  commence  in  Asia,  on  two  different  points:  against  the  fortress  of Poti, 
at  the  Black  Sea,  and  on the  frontier  of  Georgia.  The  same  paper  informs  20 
us,  that Gen.  Baraguay  d'Hilliers, the  newly  appointed  French Embassador 
at  Constantinople,  has  set  out  accompanied  by  a  staff composed of officers 
of  the  géme  and  of  the  artillerie.  Mr. Baraguay  is  known  as  a bad  General 
and  a good intriguer.  I  remind you  of  his  exploits  at the  famous  Club  of the 
Rue  de  Poitiers.

While  the  first  cannon  bullets  have  been  exchanged  in  the  war  of  the 
Russian  against  Europe,  the  first blood  has  been  spilt  in the war now raging 

466 

War-Strikes-Dearth 

in the manufacturing districts, of capital against labor.  On Friday night a riot 
took  place  at  Wigan,  arising  out  of the  contest between the  colliers  and the 
coal  kings;  on  Saturday the town was  stated to be perfectly quiet, but to-day 
we  are  informed  by  electric  telegraph that  at the colliery of Lord Crawford, 
5  or of the  Earl Balcarres,  an attack was  made by the  colliers;  that the armed 
force  was  called  out;  that  the  soldiers  fired,  and  that  one  of  the  workmen 
was  killed.  As  I  am  to  receive private  information from  the  spot,  I  adjourn 
my  report  on  this  event,  only  warning  your  readers  against  the  reports  of 
The Daily News  and  The  Times, the former of these papers being in the direct 
10  pay  of  the  Manchester  School,  and the  latter being,  as  The Morning Herald 
jusdy  remarks,  "the  bitter,  unforgiving,  relentless  enemy  of  the  working 
classes." 

15 

In  1842,  when  the  Manchester  School,  under  the  banner  of  free  trade, 
enticed the industrial proletariat into insurrectionary movements, and, in the 
time of peril, treacherously abandoned them, as  Sir Robert Peel plainly told 
the  Cobdens  in the House of Commons—at that epoch their watchword was: 
Cheap  food and dear  wages.  The  Corn  laws  having been  abrogated  and free 
trade,  as  they  do  understand  it,  realized,  their  battle-cry  has  been changed 
into:  Cheap  wages  and  dear  food.  With  the  adoption  of  the  Manchester 

20  Commercial system by Government, the millocracy had imposed upon them 
selves  a problem  impossible  to be  resolved under  their régime: the  securing 
of  an  uninterrupted  continuance  of  brisk  trade  and  commercial  prosperity. 
For  the  hour  of  adversity,  they  had  cut  off  any  position  to  fall  back upon. 
There  was  no  more  deluding  the  masses  with  Parliamentary  reform,  as  in 
25  1831 ;  the legislative influence,  conquered by that movement for the  middle 
classes,  having been exclusively  employed against the  working classes; and 
the  latter  having,  in  the  mean  time,  got  up  a  political  movement  of  their 
own—Chartism. There is no more charging the aristocratic protectionists with 
all  the  anomalies  of the  industrial  system  and  the  deadly conflicts  springing 
30  up from its very bowels, as free-trade has worked for about eight years under 
wonderfully fortunate  circumstances with  a California and an Australia—two 
worlds  of gold,  extemporized,  as  it  were,  by the imaginative powers  of the 
modern  demiurge.  Thus,  one  by  one,  step by step, the industrial bourgeoisie 
have  removed,  with their  own  hands,  all the  carefully  propagated  delusions 
that  could  be  conjured  up  at  the  hour  of  danger,  in  order  to  deturn  the 
indignation  of  the  working  classes  from  their  real  antagonist,  and to  direct 
it  against  the  antagonists  of  the  millocracy,  against  the  landed  aristocracy. 
In 1853, there have waned away the false pretenses on the part of the masters 
and  the  silly  illusions  on  the  part  of  the  men.  The  war  between  those  two 
40  classes  has  become  unmitigated,  undisguised,  openly  avowed  and  plainly 
understood.  "The  question,"  exclaim  the masters themselves in one of their 

35 

467 

Karl  Marx 

recent  manifestoes—"is  no  longer  one  of  w a g es but one  of  mastership."  The 
Manchester  liberals,  then,  have  at last thrown off  the  lion's  skin.  What they 
pretend  at—is  mastership  for  capital  and  slavery  for  labor. 

5 

Lock-out versus Turn-out, is the great lawsuit now pending in the industrial 
districts,  and  bayonets  are  likely  to  give  judgment  in  the  case.  A  whole 
industrial army, more than 70,000 working-men are disbanded and cast upon 
the  streets.  To the  muís  closed  at Preston  and Wigan there have been added 
those  of  the  district  of  Bacup,  which  includes  the  townships  of  Bacup, 
Newchurch,  Rawtenstall,  Sharnford,  and  Stanford.  At  Burnley  the  mills 
stopped last Friday;  at Padiham  on Saturday;  at Accrington the masters are 
contemplating  a  lock-out;  at  Bury,  where  about  1,000 men  are  already  out 
of  work,  the  masters have  given notice  to  their  hands  of  a "lock-out unless 
they  discontinued their  contributions to those out of work in their own town 
and  at  Preston;"  and  at  Hindley,  three large mills were  closed on Saturday 
afternoon,  and  more  than  a  thousand  additional  persons  thrown  out  of  15 
employment. 

10 

While  the  hypocritical  phrase-mongering,  squint-eyed  set of  Manchester 

humbugs  spoke  peace  to  the  Czar  at  Edinburgh,  they  acted  war  with then-
own  countrymen  at  Manchester.  While  they  preached  arbitration  between 
Russia and  Europe, they were rejecting  scornfully  all  appeals to  arbitration  20 
from  their  own  fellow-citizens.  The  workmen  of  Preston  had  carried  in  an 
open  air  meeting the  resolution  "that the delegates of the factory operatives 
recommed  the  Mayor  to  call  a public meeting of  the  manufacturers  and the 
operatives  to  agree to  an amicable  settlement of  the  dispute  now pending." 
But  the  masters  do  not  want  arbitration.  What they pretend  at is  dictation. 
While,  at  the  very  moment  of  a  European  struggle,  those  Russian  propa 
gandists  cry for reduction of the  army, they are  at the  same time augmenting 
the  army of civil  war,  the  police force, in  Lancashire  and Yorkshire.  To the 
workmen  we  can  only  say  with  The  People's  Paper: 

25 

"If they close all the mills of Lancashire, do  you send delegates to York-  30 

shire  and enlist the  support of the gallant men of the Westriding. If the mills 
of  the  Westriding are  closed,  appeal to  Nottingham  and Derby, to  Birming 
ham  and  Leicester,  to  Bristol  and Norwich,  to  Glasgow and Kidderminster, 
to  Edinburgh and Ipswich. Further and further, wider and wider, extend your 
appeals  and rally your class through every town and trade. If the employers  35 
choose  to  array  all  their  order  against  you,  do  you  array  your  entire  class 
against  them.  If  they  will  have  the  vast  class  struggle,  let them have it,  and 
we  will  abide  the  issue  of  that  tremendous  trial." 

While, on the one hand, we have the struggle of masters and men, we have, 
on  the  other,  the  struggle  of  commerce  with overstocked  markets,  and  of  40 
human  industry  with  the  short-comings  of  nature.

At  a  very  early  period  of  the  Chinese  revolution, I drew  the  attention of 
your readers to the disastrous influences it was likely to exercise on the social 
condition of Great Britain.  "The  Chinese  insurrection,"  we  are  now  told by 
The Examiner,  "is  rampant in the tea districts, the  result of which is that teas 
are  looking  up in  the  market  of  London,  and calicos  are looking down in the 
market  of  Shanghai."  "At  Shanghai,"  we  read  in  the  circular  of  Messrs. 
Bushby & Co., a Liverpool house, "the tea market has opened at prices about 
40 to 50 per cent,  above last  season.  Stocks  were light,  and supplies coming 
slowly." The last advices from Canton state that the "insurgents are generally 
spreading themselves  throughout the country  to the entire ruin of trade, that 
manufactures,  almost  without  exception,  have  given way  in price;  in  some 
instances,  the  fall  is  very  serious.  Stocks  are  large  and  fast  accumulating, 
and  we  fear  the prospect of amendment is rather remote. At Amoy the trade 
in imports, beyond a few chests  of opium,  appears  at an end for the present." 
15  The  following  is  described  as  the  state  of  the  markets  at  Shanghai:  "Both 
black teas and raw silks have been offering freely, but the conditions imposed 
by  holders  have  been  such  as  greatly  to  restrict  operations;  no  deste  ap 
peared  to  take  manufactures,  and  transactions  have  been  chiefly  effected 
by  means  of  opium  at  very  low  prices,  and  bullion  from  Canton.  Large 
amounts  of  treasure  have  been  removed  from  that  place,  but the  supply is 
rapidly being exhausted,  and we  must look to other quarters for silver bullion 
and coin,  without which we  shall soon be unable to purchase produce, unless 
a great improvement  should take place in the import market. Business in the 
latter has  been very  limited,  and chiefly confined to  sales of damaged goods 

20 

25  at auction." 

In the  commercial circular from  Messrs. Gibson & Co., dated Manchester, 
Oct. 21, we find noticed, as a most prominent cause of the actual depression, 
"not only present bad  advices  from  our  great  Chinese  market,  but the pros 
pect  of  such continuing to  arrive  in that  absence  of  confidence  in monetary 
30 transactions there, which must so inevitably be the result, and for a protract 
ed  period,  of  the  complete  and  radical  changes  which  appear  likely  to  be 
effected  in  the  Government  and  institutions  of  that  vast  Empire." 

As  to  the  Australian  markets,  The  Melbourne  Commercial  Ctcular states, 
that "Where goods purchased only about a month ago have been sold, if then 
35  delivered,  at  a profit of  no  less  than  100 or  150 per  cent.,  now  they would 
not  realize  enough  to  cover the  expenses."  Private letters  from Port Philip, 
received  last  week,  are  also  extremely unfavorable  with regard  to  the  state 
of  the  markets.  Goods  continue  to  pour  in  from  all  parts  of the  world,  and 
the  prices  they  could  command  were  so  low,  that  rather  than  submit  to 
immediate  sacrifices,  ships were being purchased in numbers, to be used for 
storage.

We  can  then  not  be  surprised  at  the  commercial  circulars  continuing  to 
record  dullness  and  declining prices  in the  markets  of the industrial  districts. 
Thus  we  read  in  the  circulars  of  Messrs.  Fraser,  Son  &  Co.,  dated  Man 
chester,  Oct. 21:  "The  extent  of  operations,  whether  for  the  home  trade,  or 
for  foreign parts,  has  been on  an  exceedingly limited  scale,  and  prices  have 
suffered  throughout  to  a  greater  or  lesser  extent.  The  further  decline  in 
7/8  prints  and  madapolams  may  be  stated  at  lll2d.  to  3d.  per  piece;  in  56  to 
66  reed  34  in.  to  36 in.  shirtings ^hd.  to 6d.  per piece; in 36-72 reed  slürtings, 
3d.  per piece;  in  39  in.  shirtings,  of  low  quality, weighing 574 to 6lbs., about 
472d.  per  piece;  in 39 in.  60 to 64 reed  shirtings  3d.  per piece;  in 45  to 54 in.  10 
sliirtings  4 7 a d.  to  Tl2d.  per  piece;  in  low  5  to  8  jaconets  l 7 2 d .,  and  in  14  to 
16  square jaconets  3 d. per piece; in Τ cloth  l 7 2 d ., in long cloths  3d. per piece 
and  in  domestic  of  certain  classes  about  l-16d. per yard.  In yarns, watered 
twist  has  delined  the  most  for  common  and  middling  qualities,  which  may 
be considered as 74d. to 7 i d. per lb. below lastmonth's quotations. Mule yarns 15 
have been most  affected in  No. 40's, which have been  selling  at a reduction 
of  fully  Id.  per  lb.  from  the  highest  point  of  the  year.  Other  yarns  at  20s. 
below  60  have  been  similarly  affected."  As to the food  market,  The London 
Weekly Dispatch  states:  " In  so  far  as  wheat  is  concerned,  the  opinions  of 
farmers, as they proceed to thrash their grain and count their stocks, is that  20 
the  crop  will  be  shorter  still  than  they  anticipated.  Indeed  they  call  it  a 
half-crop."  The  wetness  of  the  weather  since  about  a  fortnight,  highly 
unfavorable for wheat-sowing and seeding in the ground, evokes, too, serious 
apprehensions  for  the  harvest  of  1854. 

From  Oxfordshire  it is  reported  as  follows: 
"As  to  the  wheat  crop,  as  a  whole  it  is  a  miserable  failure;  farms  that 
usually  produce  from 40  to  44  bushels  per  acre  are  this  year yielding from 
15 to 20 bushels; and some well cultivated wheat and bean lands are yielding 
but from 8 to 10 bushels per acre. Potatoes sadly diseased, are an insignificant 
yield." 

25 

30 

A  Yorkshire  report  informs  us  that: 
"The  wet  has  caused  a  complete  cessation of  all  active  out-door  opera­
tions ; and the remains of the latter harvest, we are sorry to say—all the beans, 
the bulk of  spring wheat,  and  some oats, are, by being exposed to the action 
of  the  weather,  rendered  so  soft  as  to  prevent  the  hope  that  it can ever be  35 
fit to  thrash after the drying winds of spring. It is, moreover, sadly sprouted, 
and  a  sad waste of this last resource will doubtless inevitably take place.  We 
give  a faint idea of the extent of the loss to which we now refer. Commencing 
at the Tees,  and from thence to Catterick, at Stokesley, and embracing the 
lowlands  of  Cleveland,  and  eastward  of  Thirsk  to  the  sea,  westward  of  40 
Harrowgate  and  from  the  Humber  to  the  sea,  vast  quantities  of  corn  are 

470 

War—Strikes—Dearth 

abroad  and  spoiled  by  the  wet,  with  a  rainy  sky  overhead;  a  full  fifty  per 
cent,  of  the  potatoes  irrevocably  diseased,  and  a new  demand for  seed  has 
sprung  up,  with  small  stocks  of  old  corn.  It is  certain  that the  whole  of the 
wheat-growing  districts  of  the  country  are  deficient  and  spoiled  beyond  any 
former  period  within  our  recollection." 

A  Hertfordshire  report  states: 
"It  is  very  extraordinary  at this  period  of  the  year  not  to  have  concluded 
the  harvest  in  this  country.  Such,  however,  is  the  fact,  as  there  are  many 
fields  of  oats  not  yet  carted,  and  a considerable  portion of  the  spring-sown 
beans,  with  an  occasional  field  of  barley;  indeed,  there  are  some  fields  of 
lent-corn  not  yet  cut." 

The Economist of last Saturday publishes the following table, showing the 
quantities of wheat and grains  of all kinds, and of meal and flour of all kinds

The  Economist,  in  order  to  allay  the  apprehensions  of  the  city  merchants, 

draws  the  following  conclusions  from  the  foregoing  table: 

" In  1847,  notwithstanding  the  extraordinary  stimulus  of  high  prices,  we 
imported  of  wheat  and  flour,  in  the  whole  year,  only  4,464,000  quarters.  In 
the first nine months  of  the  present year we  have imported, without any such 
stimulus,  except  during  the  last  two  months,  4,856,848  quarters.  Now,  one 
of  two  things  must  be  true  with  regard  to  these  large  imports  as  they  affect 
our  own  home  supply—either  they  have  to  a  great  extent  been  consumed, 
and  have  thereby  saved  in  the  same  proportion  our  own home  production, 
or  they  are  warehoused,  and  they  will  be  available  hereafter." 

Now, this dilemma is utterly inadmissible.  Consequent on the prohibitions 
or  the threatened prohibitions  of the  export of corn from the continent,  the 
corn  merchants  thought  it  fit  to  warehouse  their  stores  meanwhile  in Eng­
land,  where  they  will  be  only  available  hereafter  in  case  of the  corn  prices 
ranging higher in England than on the continent. Besides, in contradistinction 
to  1847,  the  supply  of  the  countries  likely to be  affected by  a Russo-Turkish 
war  amounts  to  2,438,139  quarters  of  grain  and  43,727 cwt.  of  flour.  From

Egypt, too, exportation willbe prohibited after 30th November next. Finally, 
England  has  this  year  to  look  only  to  the  usual  annual  surplus  of  other 
nations, while, before the abrogation of the corn laws, it had at its disposition, 
in  seasons  of  want,  the  foreign  stocks  accumulated  during  the  favorable 
seasons. 

The  Weekly  Times,  from  its  point  of  view,  sums  up  the  situation  in  the 

following  terms: 

"The  quartern loaf  is  a  shüling—the  weather is worse  than it has  been for 
half  a  century,  at  this  season  of  the  year—the  operative  classes  are  in  the 
delirium  of  strikes—Asiatic  cholera  is  raging  among  us  once  more,  and  we 
have  got  a  war  mania.  We  only  want  war  taxes  and famine to  make up the 
orthodox  number  of  the  plagues  of  England."

New-York  Daily  Tribune. 
Nr. 3928,18. November  1853 

London,  Friday,  Nov. 4,  1853. 

Shaft  Khan,  the  Persian  Embassador  at  the  Court  of  St. James,  has  been 
suddenly recalled from England by the  Shah. This recall coïncides  strangely 
with the operations of Persia in Af f ghanistan, where it was said to have taken 5 
Herat,  and with the Russian expedition upon Khiva, the capital of the Khanat 
of  Khiva.  The  Persian  expedition  and  the  Russian  one  may  be  considered 
as two movements, the one from the west, the other from the north, centered 
on  the  Punjaub,  the  northern  outpost  of  the  British  dominions  in the  East. 
The  Russian  expedition  is  commanded  by  Gen. Perowski,  the  same  whose  10 
Khiva expeditionin 1839-40proved abortive. The Russians having organized, 
of  late  years,  a  flotilla  in  the  Aral  Sea,  are  now  able  to  ascend  the  river 
Djihun. 

A  large  Russian  fleet  is  cruising  in  the  Baltic,  where  it  recently  took  an 
opportunity  to  inspect  the  fortifications  of  Slite,  and  the  harbor  of  the  15 
Swedish  Island  of  Gothland,  of which Russia is covetous, in the manner she 
got  possession  of  the  Island  of  Aland,  close  to  the  coast  of  Sweden,  and 
strongly  fortified  by  Russia  in  1836.  From  Gothland  the  Russian  fleet  pro 
ceeded  to  the  Cattegat  and  the  Sound,  with  a view  to  support  the  King  of 
Denmark's intended coup d'état in the very probable case of the Copenhagen 20 
Diet not quietly accepting the  so-called Whole-State Constitution (Gesammt-
Staats-Verfassung)  octroyed  by the  magnanimous  Czar. The  state of  affairs 
at  Copenhagen  is  this:  The  Danish  Government  has  succeeded  in  carrying 
the  abolition  of  the  Lex  Regia,  and  introducing  the  new  law  of  royal  suc 
cession, by the  support they received from the peasant-leaguers. This party,  25 
under  the  leadership  of  Col. Tscherning,  aims  principally  at  the  trans 
formation  of  the  Feste  Gut,  a  sort  of  feudal  peasant-tenure,  into  free 
property;  and  the  introduction  of  municipal  laws  favorable  to  the  interests 

474 

Persian  Expedition  in  Afghanistan  . 

.—Denmark—The  Fighting  ...—Wigan  Colliers 

and  the  development  of  the  peasantry.  The  properly-called  national  and 
liberal party—the party  of  the  Eyderdanes,  who  formed the Casino Ministry 
in  1848, forced the  Constitution of  1849 upon the  King,  and carried the war 
against  Schleswig-Holstein—consisting  chiefly  of  professional  gentlemen, 
5  had  neglected,  like  the  rest  of  the  liberal  party  all  over  the  Continent,  to 
consult  the  interests  of  the  mass  of  the  people,  formed  in Denmark by the 
peasantry.  Thus  their influence  on the people was lost, and the Government 
has  succeeded  in  excluding  them  almost  altogether  from  the  present  Fol-
kething,  where  they  can  hardly  be  said  to  muster  more  than  ten  men.  The 
10  Government,  however,  having  got  rid  of  the  obnoxious  opposition  of  the 
Eyderdanes  by  the  aid  of  the  peasant-leaguers,  threw  off  the  mask,  called 
Mr. Oersted, who was odious  to both parties, to the Ministry; and so far from 
any  longer  cajoling the peasant party, a royal veto prevented the publication 
of  the  new  Municipal  law,  originally  introduced  by  the  Government  itself 
in  order  to  catch the  peasants.  The peasant-leaguers, duped and abused by 
the  Government,  have  entered  into  a  coalition  with  the  Eyderdanes,  and 
appointed  Monrad,  a clergyman,  and  one  of the leaders  of the  Eyderdanes, 
as  Vice-President  of  the  Committee  sitting  on  the  Constitutional  question. 
This  coalition  has  baffled  all  hope  of  overthrowing  the  Constitution  in  a 
constitutional  way,  and  accordingly  the  whole  plan having been formed by 
and for  the  Muscovites,  a Russian fleet  appears  in the  Danish waters  at the 
very  moment  of  the  crisis.

All  the  journals  of  Vienna  and  Berlin  confirm  the  intelligence  of  the 
passage  of  the  Danube  by  strong divisions  of the Turkish army.  According 
to  the  Oesterreichische  Correspondent:, the Turks  have been repulsed by the 
Russians  in  Little  Wallachia.  A  telegraphic  dispatch  states  that  a  serious 
engagement  took place  on the  21st ult.  between the  two  armies  in Asia. We 
must  wait  for  more  ample  and  authentic  information  to  account  for  the 
circumstances  which  may  have  induced  the  Turkish  Commander-in-Chief 
to  cross  the  Danube  at  Widdin,  a  maneuver  which,  at first  view,  must be 
regarded  as  a  gross  blunder.  The  Kölnische  Zeitung announces  that  Prince 
Gorchakoff  has  seized  upon  all  the  treasure-chests  (it  is  not  said  whether 
governmental  or  other)  of  Wallachia;  and,  according  to  another  German 
paper,  the  same  General  has  removed to the interior  all  deposits  of corn on 
the  Danube  designed  to  be  exported  to  foreign  countries. 

25 

30 

35 

The  news  of  advantages  gained  by  Shamyl  over  Prince  Woronzoff,  are 
confirmed  by  the  French  papers  of  to-day.  We  read  in  the  Agram  Gazette, 
that an important letter has been received by Prince Danilo from  Russia, and 
the  Prince  after  having  received  it,  gave  orders  to  have  all  the  corn  which 
40  had  been  gathered  in  from  the  Montenegrin  territory  removed  to  Zabliak. 
Cartridges are being made  and bullets cast. It is said that Russia has informed 

475 

Karl  Marx 

the  Vladika  that  a  collision between the  Turks  and  Russians  was  imminent, 
and that the war had a patriotic and sacred character; and that the Monteneg 
rins  ought  to  watch  their  frontiers  narrowly,  in  order  that  neighboring 
provinces  should  not  furnish  aid  to  the  Porte. 

The  Wanderer  of  Vienna,  of  the  28th  ult.,  says  that  a  letter  from  St.  Peters-  5 

burg  states, that the Emperor Nicholas has ordered the formation of an army 
of  reserve,  the  headquarters  of  which  are  to  be  in  Volhynia. 

On  last Tuesday  a riot occurred  at Blackburn  on occasion of the  election 

of  councilors  at  St. Peter's Ward, and the  soldiery was forced to interfere. 

With  regard  to  the  Wigan  riots,  Mr. Cowell,  the  leader  of  the laborers  at  10 

15 

Preston  has  declared in a public meeting that—"he very much regretted what 
had occurred in Wigan.  He was  sorry the people of Wigan had no more sense 
than to have recourse to a system of leveling. There was no sense in working 
people  collecting  together  and  destroying  the  property  they  had  produced. 
The  property  itself  never  did  them any injury—it was  the  men that held the 
property  that  were  the  tyrants.  Let  them  respect  property  and  life,  and by 
proceeding in  a peaceable,  orderly  and  quiet  manner,  they might rely on the 
struggle  terminating in their favor." Now I am far from defending the aimless 
acts  of  violence  committed  by  the  Wigan  colliers,  who  have  paid for them 
with the blood  of  seven men. But, on the other hand, I understand that there  20 
is  a  great  difficulty,  especially  for  the  inferior  elements  of  the  working 
classes, to which the colliers undoubtedly belong, in proceeding "peaceably, 
orderly  and  quietly,"  when they are driven to acts of frenzy by utter destitu 
tion  and  by  the  cool  insolence  of  their  masters.  The  riots  are  provoked by 
the  latter  in order to  enable themselves to  appeal to the  armed force  and to 
put  down,  as  they  have  done  in  Wigan,  all  meetings  of  the workingmen by 
order  of  the  magistrates.  The  riot  which occurred in the town of Wigan,  on 
Friday  afternoon,  was  occasioned  by  the  coal-kings  of  the  district meeting 
in  large  numbers  at  Whiteside's  Royal  Hotel,  in  order  to  deliberate  on  the 
demands  of  the  colliers;  and  by  their  coming to the resolution to repudiate  30 
all  compromise  with  the  men.  The  attack  on  the  saw-mills  at  Haigh,  near 
Wigan, which occurred on Monday, was directed against the foreign colliers, 
brought  over from  Wales  by  Mr. Peace,  the  Agent  for the Earl of Balcarres, 
in  order  to  replace  the  turnouts  of  the  coal  pits. 

25 

The  colliers  were  certainly  not  right  in preventing  their  fellow-laborers,  35 

by violence, from doing the work they had abandoned themselves. But when 
we  see the masters pledging each other by heavy fines, with a view to enforce 
their  lock-out,  can  we  be  astonished  at the  more  rude  and less  hypocritical 
manner  in  which  the  men  attempt  to  enforce  their  turn-out?  Mr. Joseph 
Hume  himself  says,  in  a letter  addressed  to  the  operatives  at Preston: 

40 

"I  see  on  the  list  of  advocates  for  arbitration  to  settle  the  disputes  of 

476 

Persian  Expedition  in  Afghanistan  ..  —Denmark—The  Fighting  ...—Wigan  Colliers 

nations, instead of having recourse to war,  many master-manufacturers who 
are  at  this  moment  in  strife  against  their  men." 

5 

15 

The  Manufacturers'  Association  at Preston have  published  a manifesto  in 
order  to  justify  the  general  lock-out.  Their  sincerity  may  be  inferred  from 
the  fact,  that  the  masters'  secret  league,  the  programme  of  which  I  com 
municated to your readers about two months ago, is not mentioned in a single 
word,  thus  giving  the  hue  of  a necessity, which the masters were unable  to 
escape, to the deliberate result of conspiracy. They reproach the workingmen 
with  asking for  10 per cent,  neither more  or less.  They do not tell the public 
io that, when the masters took off 10 per cent, in 1847, they promised to restore 
it  as  soon as  trade  had  revived,  and that the  men have been informed  again 
and  again  of  the  revival  of  trade  by  the  glowing  descriptions  of  Messrs. 
Bright,  Cobden & Co.,  by the declamations of the whole middle-class press, 
and by  the  royal  speech  on  the  opening  of  Parliament.  They  do  not  tell  us 
that  bread  is  more  than 40 per  cent,  dearer,  coals  15  to  20 per  cent., meat, 
candles,  potatoes,  and  all other articles,  largely  entering in the consumption 
of  the  working-classes,  about  20 per  cent,  dearer  than  before,  and  that the 
manufacturers  vanquished  their  antagonists  under  the  banner  of:  Cheap 
bread  and dear labor!  They  reproach  the  men with  continuing to  enforce  an 
equalization of wages in the same town for the müls of the same description. 
Why does  not the whole  doctrine of their masters,  of Ricardo  and  Malthus, 
proceed from  supposing  such  an equalization to  exist throughout the whole 
country?  The  men,  they  say,  are  acting  under  the  orders  of  a  Committee. 
They are instigated by  "strangers,"  "intruders,"  "traders  in agitation."  Just 
the  same thing was  contended on the part of the protectionists reproaching, 
at the time of the Anti Corn Law League, the same manufacturers with being 
directed  by  Messrs.  Bright  and  Cobden,  "two  professional traders  in agita 
tion,"  and  with blindly  acting  under  the  orders  of  the  Revolutionary Com 
mittee  at  Manchester,  levying taxes,  commanding  an  army  of lecturers  and 
30  missionaries, inundating the country with small and large prints and forming 
a  state  in  the  state.  The  most  curious  fact  is  that while  the  masters  accuse 
the  men  of  "acting under the orders  of a Committee,"  they call themselves 
the  "United  Manufacturers'  Association,"  publishing  their  very  manifesto 
through  a  Committee  and  plotting  with  the  "strangers"  of  Manchester, 
35  Bolton, Bury, etc. The  "strangers" of whom the masters' manifesto speaks, 

20 

25 

are  merely  the  men  of  the  neighboring  industrial  localities. 

1  am  far,  however,  from  supposing  that  the  work-men  will  obtain  the 
immediate end their  strikes  aim at.  On the contrary, I have  stated in a former 
letter,  that  at  no  distant  period  they  will  have  to  strike  against  a  reduction 
instead of for an  advance of wages.  Already reductions of wages are growing 
numerous,  and  producing  their'correspondent  quota  of  strikes.  The  true 

40 

477 

Karl  Marx 

result  of  this  whole  movement  will  be  as  I  stated  on  a  previous  occasion, 
that  "the  activity  of  the  working  classes  will  soon  be  carried  over  to  the 
political field, when the new organization of trades, gained in the strikes, will 
prove  of  immense  value  to  them."  Ernest  Jones,  and  the  other  Chartist 
leaders,  are  again in the  field;  and  on the  great  meeting  at  Manchester,  on 
last  Sunday,  the  following  resolution  was  passed: 

5 

"That after  witnessing the  united exertions of the master class against the 
trades  of this  country,  by  opposing  a fair  day's  wages  for  a fair  day's work, 
this  meeting is of opinion that the present struggle of labor cannot be carried 
to  a  successful  issue,  except  by  subverting  the  monopolies  of  the  master  10 
class,  through  the  representation  of  the  laboring  classes  in the  Commons's 
House  of  Parliament by  the  enactment  of the  People's  Charter,  when  alone 
they will be  enabled to  make laws  in their  own interest,  to  repeal those  that 
are  injurious,  and  to  obtain  the  command  of  means  of  work,  high  wages, 
cheap  food,  steady trade,  and  independent  self-employment."

The Progress of the Turkish War.

There is no longer a doubt that military operations have begun on the Danube. 
Omer  Pasha has crossed that river  at  Widdin, occupied Kalafat, a village on 
the  opposite  side,  and  marched  his  advanced  guard  upon  Krajova,  while 
another  attack  of  the  Turks,  from  Rustchuk,  has  been  made  upon  the  op 
posite  town  of  Giurgevo,  and  a  third  and  fourth  attack  in  the  direction  of 
Ibraila  and  Turna  are  spoken  of.  At  the  same  time  another engagement, in 
which  the  Russians  were  the  attacking  party,  has  taken place  at  Oltenitza. 
This last affair is reported by one of our dispatches to have lasted three hours 
and  to  have  ended  in  the  repulse  of  the  Russians;  while  another  dispatch, 
received  from  Vienna  on  the  evening  of the  8th  inst.,  states  that the battle 
lasted  twenty-eight  hours,  and  that even the  result was not ascertained. The 
former  account  seems  more  likely  to  be  true. 

The  results  of  the  other  rencontres  are  also  variously  stated.  That  at 
15  Giurgevo  appears  by  all  accounts  to  have  been fruitless;  of  the  effects  of 
those  near Ibraila and Turna, we are ignorant; as to the advance from Kalafat, 
some  telegraphs  report  advantages  gained by the Turks  and a repulse of the 
Russians—others,  the  Turks  to  have  been checked  at once,  and  driven back 
upon  Kalafat.  The  probabilities  remain  in  favor  of  the  first  report. 

20 

What is  certain, in the whole, is this: Omer Pasha, from reasons hereafter 
to  be  considered,  has  abandoned  what  we  have  before  this  declared  to  be 
the  natural position of  the  Turks  on this  frontier,  namely, the defensive.  He 
has  taken  offensive  steps,  and  profiting  by  the  withdrawal  of the  Russians 
from  Lesser Wallachia, he  crossed  the Danube  at the extreme left of his own 
25  position,  at Widdin, on the 28th of October; with what force, we are utterly 
at a loss to make out. However, as since then we have only heard of simulated 
or partial attacks of the Turks on other points, and as it would be agratuitous 
madness  to  pass  a  river  like  the  Danube  in  the  face  of  a  powerful  enemy, 
with  a force  of  no consequence, we may take it for granted that Omer Pasha 

479 

Friedrich  Engels 

has  with  him  the  main  portion  of  his  disposable  active  army.  For,  unless 
convinced  by  undoubtable  intelligence,  we  will  not  believe  that  he  has 
committed  himself  so  far  as  some  dispatches  maintain,  by  crossing  the 
Danube  with  7,000  men  and  having  no  nearer  supports  or  reserves  than 
8,000 men at  Sofia,  150 miles off. Yet, as the main body of the Turkish army 
has  but  very  lately  been  concentrated  at  Varna,  Shumla  and Rustchuk,  we 
find it equally difficult to  explain how  Omer Pasha should all at once succeed 
in  concentrating  the  gross  of  his  army  at Widdin,  250  miles,  on an average, 
distant  from  the  above  places. 

5 

10 

The most probable  solution is, that on seeing the advance of the Russians 
toward  Widdin,  Omer  Pasha has  shifted  the  position  of  his  army  in  a  con 
siderable  degree  to  the  left;  leaving  the  defense  of  the  direct  road  to  Con 
stantinople  to the garrisons of Rustchuk,  Silistria, Varna and Shumla, he has 
taken Rustchuk for  the  support of  his  right,  Widdin for that of his left wing, 
Nicopolis for the rallying point of his center. In this position, extending from 
Rustchuk to  Widdin, some 200 miles, he has rallied to his left wing whatever 
troops  he  could  collect  with him,  and  passed  the  Danube,  thus  apparently 
turning the right wing of the Russians. He expected to fall upon their advance 
corps and to force them to retreat behind the river Shill, the passage of which 
he  might  either  force  in  front,  or  by  sending  near  Rahova  another  corps  20 
across  the  Danube,  which  would  thus  turn  the  Shill.  The  river  Aluta,  the 
second  tributary  of  the  Danube  which runs  across  the  road  from  Widdin  to 
Bucharest,  might  be  forced  in  the  same  way,  by  throwing  another  portion 
of  the Turkish center  across  the Danube  at Nicopolis  and Turna, below  the 
junction of this river with the Aiuta.  Finally,  simulated attacks lower down,  25 
at  Giurgevo  and  Ibraila,  might  contribute  to lead  the  Russians  into  error  as 
to  the  real  points  at  which  the  Turks  were  arriving. 

15 

There  can  be  hardly  a doubt that,  leaving political  motives  for  a moment 
out  of  the  question,  such  must  have  been  the  plans  of  Omer  Pasha.  The 
London  Times  speaks  of  an  actual passage  of  the  Turks  at  Giurgevo;  but 
this  is  an  evident  falsehood.  There  is  not an ensign in  any  disciplined army 
who  would  commit  such a blunder as  to  cross  the greatest river in Europe— 
where  it is  broadest  and  most  difficult, too—with two corps,  at two  different 
points, 250 miles  asunder,  in the presence of a respectable and concentrated 
enemy. 

30 

35 

What,  then,  does  Omer  Pasha's  maneuver  amount to?  It is  an attempt to 
turn  the  flank  of  the  enemy,  and  to roll  up by  simultaneous  flank  and  front 
attacks,  his whole line of battle.  Such a maneuver is perfectly justified when 
you  can  bring,  unawares,  your  own  main  strength upon the  enemy's  flank; 
when  your  front  is  safe  from  attack; when your retreat,  in  case  of  a check,  40 
is  secured;  and when, by rolling up, from one flank to the other, the enemy's 

480 

The  Progress  of  the  Turkish  War 

position,  you  cut off  his  communications  with  his  base  of operations. Now, 
in the  present instance, the latter conviction is not fulfilled.  On the contrary, 
while  Omer  Pasha's  retreat  may  be  menaced by  the  right wing of  his  corps 
in Wallachia being outflanked, and the road to Kalaf at thus cut off, (in which 
5  case  his  only  retreat  would  be  into  Austria,)  the  attack  from  Kalaf  at  toward 
Bucharest  does  not  at  all  interfere  with  the  Russian  line  of  retreat.  It  will 
be  recollected  that,  upon  that  ground,  we  stated  some  time  ago,  the  only 
useful  line  of  attack  for  the  Turks,  to  be  that  from  the  Danube  toward the 
Sereth,  or  the  narrow  strip  of  land  which  divides  Bessarabia  from  the 
10  Austrian  frontier.  Instead  of  the  movement  which  would  at  once  have 
menaced,  if  not  interrupted  the  Russian line  of communications, the  Turks 
attack at the opposite end where, even in case of victory, no decisive success 
is  to  be  expected.  As  to  the  Turkish front being  safe from  attack, that may 
be  the  case,  in  so  far  as  the  main  operations  taking  place  between  Widdin 
and Krajova or Slatina, the Russians are not likely to cross the Danube lower 
down—unless  they  were  bolder  in their  strategy  than  we  know  them  to be. 
But  at the  same  time,  the Turkish front from  Widdin to  Rustchuk is equally 
impeded by the large river which separates it from the enemy, and there must 
be  comparative  inaction  in  that  quarter. 

15 

25 

20 

The  main  condition,  however,  is  not fulfilled  in  this  instance. 
We have a  splendid historical example of this  sort of maneuver in the battle 
of  Jena.  Napoleon  succeeded  in  bringing  the  mass  of  his  forces  unawares 
upon  the  left  flank  of  the  Prussians,  and  in  eight  hours  rolled  them  up  so 
completely, that the Prussian army was  cut off from its retreat, and annihilat-
ed,  and  has  never  been  heard  of  since  as  an  army.  But that  took place  on 
a  ground  twenty  miles  square  and  within  twenty  hours.  Here  we  have  a 
territory two hundred miles by fifty, with no roads, and the duration of every 
movement  corresponding  thereto.  The  surprise,  the  vigor  and  impetuosity 
of  attack,  to  which Napoleon at Jena owed his complete  success, must here, 
after a few efforts,  literally  stick fast in the mud. This will be more apparent 
if we look at the map. The Turks, from Kalaf at, have to march upon Krajova. 
Here  they  meet  with  the  first  of  those  rivers,  which  descending  from  the 
Transylvanian Alps  to  the  Danube,  traverse  Wallachia from  north to  south, 
and  form  as  many  lines  of  defense  to  be  forced by  an  attacking  army.  The 
35  country  is  exactly  similar  in this  respect to  Lombardy,  and  the  two  rivers 
here  in  question,  the  Shill  and  Aluta,  may  be  compared  to  the  Mincio  and 
Adige,  whose  military  importance  has  so  often  been  conspicuous. 

30 

Supposing  the  Turks  force  the  passage  of the  Shill, which they may per 
haps do, they will meet the first serious resistance on the Aluta, near Slatina. 
40  The Aluta is a much more formidable barrier by its width and depth; besides, 
with  a  little  alacrity,  the  Russians  may  there  concentrate  an  army  capable 

481 

Friedrich  Engels 

5 

not  only  of  repelling  all  Turkish  attacks,  but  of  following  up  the  victory  at 
once.  Indeed,  a  Russian  victory  at  Krajova,  unless  very  strongly  defined, 
would not be of much importance, as in three forced marches the Turks could 
reach Kalaf at and the Danube, and thus escape pursuit. But a Turkish defeat 
at  Slatina,  besides  being  more  decisive  from  the  greater  mass  of  Russian 
troops  collected  there,  would  give  the  Russians five  or  six  days  of  pursuit; 
and  everybody  knows  that  the  fruits  of  a  victory  are  not  collected  on  the 
field  of battle,  but during the pursuit, which may bring about a total disorga 
nization  of  the  discomfited  army.  It  is,  then,  not  likely  that  Omer  Pasha, 
if Gorchakof f wishes to oppose him there, will ever be able to cross the Aluta; 10 
for  taking every chance  in favor of the Turks, Omer Pasha cannot bring more 
than  25,000  men  to  the  banks  of  that  river,  while  Gorchakoff  may  easily 
collect  35,000  in  good  time.  As  to  the  flank  attacks  of  the  Turks  from  the 
southern  shore  of  the  Danube,  they  are tolerably  harmless, if the  attacking 
force  does  not  dispose  of  a  prodigious  quantity  of  pontoons  and  other  15 
materials  very  rarely  met  with  among  the  Turks.  But  supposing  that  even 
the  Aluta were forced,  and  even the Ardsish,  another important river further 
east,  who  will  imagine  that  Omer Pasha can  succeed in forcing  the  Russian 
retrenchments  at  Bucharest,  and  in putting  to  flight,  in  a pitched battle,  an 
army which must certainly out-number by about one third the troops he could 
bring  against  it? 

20 

If  the war, then, is conducted upon anything like military principles on the 
Russian  side,  Omer Pasha's  defeat  appears  certain; but if it is carried on not 
according  to  military  but  to  diplomatic  principles,  the  result  may  be  dif 
ferent. 

25 

The  voluntary retreat of the  Russians from  the  important military position 
of  Kalaf  at,  after  so  many  troops  had  been  sent  there  to  menace  Servia;  the 
unresisted  passage  of  the  Danube  by  Omer  Pasha;  his  comparatively  un 
molested  and very  slow  movements  in  Lesser  Wallachia,  (the  country  west 
of the Aluta;) the insignificance, as far as we can judge, of the Turkish attacks  30 
on all other points; lastly, the  strategical errors  implied in the advance from 
Widdin,  and  which  nobody can for  a  moment  suppose  Omer  Pasha  to  have 
overlooked—all these facts  seem to give  some ground for a conclusion which 
has  been  adopted  by  some  competent  judges,  but  which  appears  rather 
fanciful.  It  is,  that  there  is  a  sort  of  tacit  understanding  between  the  two  35 
opposing generals, by which Lesser Wallachia is to be ceded by the Russians 
to  the Turks.  The  Aluta,  say those  who  entertain this  opinion, forms  a very 
comfortable  natural  barrier,  across  which  the  two  armies  may look at each 
other the  whole  dreary  winter  long,  while the  diplomatists again busy them 
selves  to  find  out  a  solution.  The  Russians,  by  receding  as  far,  would  not  40 
only  show the generosity and peaceable feelings, but they would at the  same 

482 

w 

The  Progress  of  the  Turkish  War 

5 

time  get  a  sort  of  right  upon  the  usurped  territory,  as  a joint occupation of 
the  Principalities  by  Russians  and Turks  is  a thing  exceedingly in harmony 
with  existing  treaties.  They  would,  by  this  apparent  generosity  in  Europe, 
escape  real  dangers  in  Asia,  where  they  appear  to  be  worse  off  than  ever, 
and above all, they would at any moment be strong enough to drive the Turks 
out  of the  strip  of  territory  allowed to  them  on the  left bank of the Danube. 
Curious  but  by  no  means  satisfactory  evidence  in favor  of  this  theory may 
be found in the fact that it is openly propounded by Vienna journals enjoying 
the  confidence  of the  Court.  A  few  days will  show whether this  view of the 
10  question  is  correct,  or  whether  actual  war,  in good  earnest is  to be carried 
on.  We  shall  be  disappointed  if  the  latter  does  not  prove  to  be  the  case. 

20 

15 

In  Asia  we begin to  find  out that  both  parties are a good deal weaker than 
was  supposed.  According  to  the  Journal  de  Constantinople,  the  Turks  had, 
on  the  9th  October,  in  Erzerum  10,000 men,  as  a reserve;  in  Batum,  4,000 
regulars  and  20,000  irregulars,  intended,  evidently,  for  an  active  army;  in 
Bayazid,  on  the  Persian  frontier,  3,000  men;  in  Kars  and Ardahan,  the two 
most  important  points  on  the  Russian  frontier,  (next  to  Batum)  advanced 
guards  of,  together,  16,000  men.  These  were to  be  reënforced  in  a few  days 
by  10 or  12,000 fresh troops from Syria. This certainly is a very considerable 
reduction from  what other reports led us to suppose; they are 65,000 instead 
of  100,000!  But  on  the  other  hand,  if  the  news  by way of Constantinople  is 
to  be trusted,  the  main pass  of the  Caucasus,  connecting Tiflis  and Georgia 
with  Russia  is  in  the  hands  of  the  mountaineers;  Shamyl  has  driven  the 
Russians  back  to  within  nine  miles  of  Tiflis;  and  Gen. Woronzoff,  com-
25  mander  in Georgia,  has  declared that in case of a Turkish war he  could not 
hold that province unless reënf orced by 50,000 men. How far these accounts 
may be  correct we  cannot judge;  but the  reënforcements  sent in great haste 
by  sea to  Jerkkum Kalé, Redut Kalé and other points on the Transcaucasian 
coast  prove  that  the  star  of  Russia  does  not  shine  very  brilliantly  in  that 
30  quarter.  As  to  the  strength  of these  reënforcements,  reports  differ;  it  was 
first said 24,000 men had been sent, but where were the Russians  to get ships 
for  such  an  army?  It  now  turns  out  that  the  13th  Division,  the  first  of  the 
5th  corps  (General  Lüders)  has  been  sent  thither;  that  would  be  some 
14,000 men,  which  is  more  than  likely.  As  to  the  story  of the  Cossacks  of 
the  Black  Sea having rounded  by land,  the  western point of the Caucasus, 
and  succeeded  in  passing  undisturbed  along  the  rocky  and  narrow  shore 
toward Redut Kalé, to the strength of 24,000 men, (this seems to be a favorite 
number  with  the  Russians)  the  longer  we  look  at it,  the  more  incredible  it 
seems.  The Tchornomorski Cossacks  have plenty to do to guard the line of 
the  Kuban  and  the  Terek,  and  as  to  cavalry  passing,  single-handed  and 
unattacked,  in  such  force,  a  defile  of  one  hundred  and  fifty miles,  through 

35 

40 

483 

Friedrich  Engels 

a  hostile  population,  where  a few  men  might  stop  them or  cut their column 
in two—these  things  are  only heard of in Russia, where up to the present day 
it  is  affirmed  that  Suwaroff  beat  Masséna  at  Zurich. 

Here,  then,  is  the  best  ground  for  the  Turks  to  act.  Rapid,  concentrated 
attacks  of  the regulars  on one  main road to Tiflis—along  shore,  if the Turks 
can  hold  out  at  sea;  by  Kars  or  Ardahan,  in  the  interior,  if  they  cannot— 
accompanied  by  an  indefatigable,  energetic,  sudden  warfare,  according  to 
their  own  fashion,  by  the  irregulars, would  soon put Woronzoff in an inex 
tricable  position,  open a communication with  Shamyl,  and  ensure  a general 
insurrection  of  the  whole  Caucasus.  But  here  more  than  on  the  Danube 
boldness, rapidity,  and  ensemble of  action is  required.  It remains to be  seen 
whether  these  qualities  belong to  the  Turkish commanders  in that region.

The Russian Defeats.

We  have  carefully examined  the  European journals  brought by  the  Canada 
in  order  to  gather  all  possible  light  as  to the fighting which has taken place 
between the Turks  and  the Russians  in Wallachia,  and  are  able  to add some 
important facts to those reported by the  Washington, which we commented 
upon on Friday last. We knew then that several engagements had taken place, 
and  with  regard  to  their  details  we  know  little  more  now.  Our  reports  are 
still  incoherent,  contradictory  and  scanty,  and  so  will  probably  remain  till 
we  receive  the  official  dispatches  of  the  Turkish  Generals.  So  much  is, 
1 o however, clear, namely, that the Turks have been maneuvered with a degree 
of  skill  and  have  fought  with  a  steady  enthusiasm  sufficient  to  justify  the 
laudations  of  their  warmest  admirers,—laudations  that  by  the  mass  of  cool 
and impartial men have been regarded as exaggerated. The result is a general 
surprise. Of Omer Pasha's talents as a commander, all persons were prepared 
to  receive  very  brilliant  proofs,  but  the  merit  of  his  army  has  not  been 
recognized  by  western  journalists  or  statesmen  at  its  true  value.  It  is  true 
its  ranks  are  filled  by  Turks,  but  they  are  a  very  different  sort  of  soldiers 
from those  Diebitch drove before him in 1829. They have beaten the Russians 
with  heavy  odds  and under  unfavorable  circumstances.  We  trust  this  may 

15 

20  prove  but the  augury  and  beginning  of  far  more  conclusive  defeats. 

25 

We  now  learn for  the  first time  that the Council of War at Constantinople 
had  concentrated  at  Sofia  an  army  of  some  25,000  men in  order  to  operate 
in  Servia  in  case  of  need.  Of  this  force  and  its  destination,  strange  to  say, 
no  previous  information  seems  to  have  reached  Western  Europe,  but  it is 
clear  that  Omer  Pasha has  made  the  best use  of  it.  Its  disposition at  Sofia 
was a blunder since if the Servians should not revolt and make common cause 
with  the  Russians—which  under  the  reigning  prince  they  are  not  likely  to 
do,—there is no occasion for an army in that quarter; while in case of arevolt 
the Turks must either march into the country and  suppress it, for which, with 

485 

Friedrich  Engels 

the  Russians  in  Wallachia,  25,000 men would not  suffice,  or else they  must 
occupy the passes  of the frontier and confine the Servians at home, for which 
a  quarter  of  that  force  would  be  ample.  Omer  Pasha  evidently  viewed  the 
matter  in  this  light,  for  he  has  marched  the  corps  straight  to  Widdin,  and 
added  it  to  the  force  he  had  there  previously.  This  reenforcement  has,  no 
doubt, essentially contributed to the victory he has now gained over the right 
wing of the Russians under General Dannenberg,  a victory of which we have 
no  particulars  beyond  the  number  of  Russian  officers  killed  and  captured; 
but  which must have been quite complete, and will prove morally even more 
beneficial to  the Turks  than it was  materially. 

5 

10 

We  now  learn,  also,  that  the  Turkish  force  which crossed from  Turtukai 
(a  point  between  Rustshuk  and  Silistria),  to  Oltenitza,  was  led  by  Ismael 
Pasha or General Guyon (he has not renounced Christianity though he holds 
a high rank in the Sultan's army,) whose gallantry in the Hungarian war gave 
him  a  high  reputation  as  a  bold,  energetic  and  rapid  executive  officer.  15 
Without  remarkable  strategic  talent,  there  are  few  men  who  will  carry  out 
orders  with  such  effect,  as  he  has  proved  on  the  present  occasion,  where 
he  repelled  his  assailant  with  the  bayonet.  The  defeat  of  Gen. Pawloff  at 
Oltenitza,  must  substantially  open  the  country  behind  the  Aluta,  and  clear 
the  way  to  Bucharest,  since  it  is  proved  that  Prince  Gorchakoff  has  not  20 
advanced  to  Slatina,  as  was  reported,  but  remains  at  the  Capital  of  the 
Principahties,  wisely  preferring  not  to  divide  his  forces,  which  is  again  an 
indication that he  does  not think himself  entirely  secure.  No doubt a decisive 
battle has been fought long ere this in the vicinity of that place. If Gorchakoff 
is  not  a  humbug,  and  if  he  can  concentrate  there  from  seventy  to  eighty  25 
thousand  men—a  number  which  all  reasonable  deductions  from the  official 
force  of  the  Russians  still  leave  to  him—the  advantage  is  decidedly  on  his 
side.  But  seeing how false and exaggerated are the figures reported from the 
Russian  camp;  seeing  how  much  more  powerful  and  effective  is  Omer 
Pasha's  army  than  has  been  supposed,  the  conditions  of  the  campaign  be-  30 
come  more  equal  than  has  been  imagined,  and  the  defeat  of  Gorchakoff 
comes within the probabilities of the case. Certainly, if the Turkish General 
issimo  can  concentrate  for  the  decisive  struggle  fifty  or  sixty  thousand 
troops  already  flushed  with  victory—and  we  now  see  nothing  to  prevent 
it—his  chance  of  success  is  decidedly favorable.  In saying this we desire to  35 
speak with moderation,  for there is  no use in  making the Turks  seem better 
off  than  they  are  because  our  sympathies  are  with  them. 

It is impossible to study the geographical structure of Wallachia, especially 
in  a  military point  of  view  without being reminded  of  Lombardy. In the one 
the Danube  and in the other the Po and its confluents form the southern and  40 
western  boundaries.  The  Turks  have  also  adopted  a  similar  plan  of  action 

486 

The  Russian  Defeats 

with that pursued by  the Piedmontese in the campaign of  1849, ending in the 
disastrous  battle  of  Novara.  If  the  Turks  prove  victorious,  the  greater will 
be  their  claim  on  our  admiration,  and  the  more  palpable  the  bullying  in 
capacity  of  the  Muscovite.  At  all  events  Gorchakòff  is  no  Radetzky  and 
Omer  Pasha  no  Ramorino.

The  Labor Question. 

From  Our  Own  Correspondent. 

London, Friday, Nov. 11,  1853. 

Golden  opportunities,  and  the  use  made  of  them,  is  the  title  of  one  of  the 
most  tragi-comical  effusions  of  the  grave  and  profound  Economist.  The 
"golden  opportunities"  were,  of  course,  afforded  by  Free  Trade,  and  the 
" u s e"  or  rather  "abuse"  made  of  them  refers  to  the  working  classes. 

5 

"The working classes, for the first time, had their future in their own hands ! 
The  population  of  the  United  Kingdom  began  actually  to  diminish,  the 
emigration carrying off  more than its  natural increase.  How  have the work-  10 
ingmen  used  their  opportunity?  What have  they  done?  Just  what they  used 
to  do  formerly,  on  every  recurrence  of  temporary  sunshine,  married  and 
multiplied as fast as possible. At this rate of increase it will not be long before 
emigration  is  effectually  counterbalanced,  and  the  golden  opportunity 
thrown  away."  The  golden opportunity of not marrying and not multiplying,  15 
except  at  the  orthodox  rate  allowed  by  Malthus  and  his  disciples!  Golden 
morality  this!  But,  till  now,  according  to  The  Economist itself,  population 
has  diminished,  and  has  not  yet  counterbalanced emigration.  Over-popula 
tion,  then,  will  not  account  for  the  disasters  of  the  times. 

"The next use the laboring classes should have made of their rare occasion  20 

ought to have been to accumulate savings and become capitalists. In scarcely 
one  instance  do  they  seem  to  have  risen,  or  begun  to  rise,  into  the rank of 
capitalists.  They  have  thrown  away their  opportunity."  The  opportunity  of 
becoming  capitalists !  At the  same  time  The Economistteils  the workingmen 
that,  after  they  had  at  last  obtained ten  per  cent,  on  their former earnings,  25 
they were able to pocket 16s. 6d. aweekinstead of 15s. Now,the mean wages 
are too highly calculated at  15s.  per week.  But never  mind.  How to become 

488 

The  Labor  Question 

5 

10 

a  capitalist  out  of  15  shillings  a  week!  That  is  a problem  worthy  of  study. 
The  workingmen had the false idea that in order to  ameliorate their  situation 
they  must  try  to  ameliorate  their  incomes.  "They  have  struck,"  says  TTie 
Economist,  "for  more  than  would  have  done  them  any  service."  With 
15  shillings  a week  they  had  the  very  opportunity  of  becoming  capitalists, 
but with  16s.  6d.  this  opportunity would be gone.  On the one hand working-
men must keep hands  scarce and capital abundant, in order to be able to force 
on the  capitalists a rise of wages.  But if capital turns out to be abundant, and 
labor  to  be  scarce,  they  must  by  no  means  avail  themselves  of  that  power 
for  the  acquisition  of  which  they  were  to  stop  marrying  and  multiplying. 
"They  have  lived  more  luxuriously."  Under  the  corn  laws,  we  are  told  by 
the  same  Economist,  they  were  but  half  fed,  half  clothed,  and  more  or  less 
starved.  If  they were  then to  live  at all,  how  could  they contrive  to  live less 
luxuriously  than  before?  The  tables  of  importation  were  again  and  again 
unfolded  by  The  Economist,  to  prove  the  growing prosperity  of  the  people 
and the  soundness  of the business done.  What was thus proclaimed as  a test 
of  the  unspeakable  blessings  of  free-trade,  is  now  denounced  as  a proof  of 
the  foolish  extravagance  of  the  working classes.  We remain, however,  at a 
loss  to  understand  how  importation  can go  on increasing with a decreasing 
20  population  and  a  declining  consumption;  how  exportation can continue  to 
rise  with  diminisldng  importation,  and  how  industry  and  commerce  can 
expand  themselves  with  imports  and  exports  contracted.

"The third use made of the golden opportunity should have been to procure 
the  best  possible  education  for  themselves  and  their  children,  so  as  to  fit 
themselves  for  the  improvement  in  their  circumstances,  and  to  learn  how 
to  turn it to the best account.  Unhappily, we  are obliged to  state that schools 
have  seldom been so ill attended, or school fees so ill paid." Is there anything 
marvelous  in this  fact?  Brisk trade was  synonimous with enlarged factories, 
with  increased  application  of  machinery,  with  more  adult  laborers  being 
replaced by  women  and  children,  with prolonged hours of work. The more 
the  mill was  attended by the mother  and the  child, the  less  could the  school 
be frequented.  And,  after all, of what  sort of education would you have given 
the  opportunity to  the  parents  and  their  children?  The  opportunity of learn 
ing  how  to  keep  population  at  the  pace  described  by  Malthus,  says  The 
35  Economist.  Education,  says  Mr. Cobden,  would  show  the  men  that  filthy, 
badly ventilated, overstocked lodgings, are not the best means of conserving 
health and  vigor.  As  well  might you  save  a man from  starving by telling him 
that  the  laws  of  Nature  demand  a  perpetual  supply  of  food  for  the  human 
body.  Education,  says  The Daily News,  would  have  informed  our  working-
classes  how  to  extract nutritive  substance  out of  dry  bones—how to  make 
tea  cakes  of  starch,  and  how  to  boil  soup  with  devil's  dust.

If we  sum  up  then,  the golden opportunities which have thus been thrown 
away  by  the  working  classes,  they  consist  of  the golden  opportunity  of  not 
marrying,  of  the  opportunity  of  living  less  luxuriously,  of  not  asking  for 
higher wages, of becoming capitalists  at  15  shillings  a week, and of learning 
how  to  keep  the  body  together  with  coarser  food,  and  how  to  degrade  the 
soul  with  the  pestiferous  doctrines  of  Malthus.

On  Friday  last  Ernest  Jones  visited  the  town  of  Preston to  address  the 
factory-hands  locked out of the mills, on the labor question. By the appointed 
time  at  least  15,000  persons  (The  Preston  Pilot  estimates  the  number  at 
12,000)  had  assembled  on the  ground,  and  Mr. Jones,  on proceeding to  the  10 
spot,  was  received  with an enthusiastic  welcome.  I give some extracts from 
his  speech: 

"Why  have  these  struggles  been?  Why  are  they  now?  Why  will  they 
return?  Because  the  fountains  of  your  life  are  sealed  by the hand of capital, 
that quaffs its golden goblet to the lees  and gives the dregs to you. Why are  15 
you  locked  out of  life  when you  are  locked  out of the factory? Because you 
have  no  other  factory  to  go  to—no  other  means  of working for  your  bread. 
What gives the capitalist this tremendous power? That he holds all the means 
of  employment...  The means  of work is, therefore,  the hinge  on which the 
future of the  people  turns  . ..  It  is  a  mass-movement  of all trades, a national  20 
movement  of  the  working-classes,  that  can  alone  achieve  a  triumphant 
r e s u l t . ..  Sectionalize  and  localize  your  struggle and you may fail—national 
ize  it  and  you  are  sure  to  win." 

Mr. George  Cowell  in  very  complimentary  terms  moved,  and  Mr. John 
Matthews  seconded,  a vote of thanks to Ernest Jones for his visit to Preston 
and  the  services  he  was  rendering  to  the  cause  of  labor. 

25 

Great exertions had been made on the part of the manufacturers to prevent 
Ernest Jones visiting the town; no hall could be had for the purpose, and bills 
were accordingly printed in Manchester convening an open-air meeting. The 
report had been industriously circulated by some self-interested parties, that 
Mr. Jones was  going to  oppose  the  strike,  and  sow  division among the  men, 
and  letters  had  been  sent that it would not be personally safe for him to visit 
Preston.

Prosperity—The  Labor Question. 

From  Our  Own  Correspondent. 

London,  Tuesday,  Nov. 15,1853. 

"The  Trade  Returns  and  the  Money  Market"  is  the  title  under  which  The 
5  Economist publishes  an  article  intended  to prove the general  prosperity and 
the  fair  prospects  of  trade,  although  we  are  told  in  the  same  number  that 
"provisions  are  high  and  are  still  rising  in  price,"  that  "a  quarter  of  wheat 
will  sell  at  80  shillings,"  and  that  "the  state  of the  Cotton trade is  not  such 
as  to  make  the  mill-owners  at all anxious to  recommence work."  "There  is 
10  much  of  instruction,"  says  The  Economist,  speaking  of  the  tables  of  im 
portations,  "conveyed  in  these  long  columns  of figures—so  much that goes 
to  confirm  great  principles  which  have  been  the  subject  of  strong political 
contest—so  much  that  explains  the  recent events,  with regard to  the  money 
market,  and  casts  light  upon  the  future—so  much  that  is  highly  instructive 
to the  statesman, the financier, the banker,  and the trader, in enabling them 
to  take  an accurate view of the  state  of things  at present, and to make a just 
estimate  of  their position  hereafter—that we feel we cannot perform a better 
service  than  to  call  attention  to  some  of  the  main facts  developed  by these 
returns,  and trace their connection with other most important features of the 
time."

Let  us  then  sit  down  at  the  feet  of  this  prophet  and  hearken  to  his  very 
circumlocutory  oracles.  This  time  the  tables  of  importation  are  referred  to 
in  order to prove,  not the lavish expenditure  of the working classes, but the 
unspeakable  blessings  these  very  classes  are  reaping from free trade. These 
tables  are  as follows:

One  glance over this  table  shows us  the fallacy of  TTje Economist.  All we 
know  of  the  enumerated  commodities  is,  not that they  have  been  consumed, 
as is stated, but that they have been entered tor consumption, which is quite 
a  different  thing.  There  is  no  shop-keeper  so  ignorant  as  not  to  be  able  to 
distinguish  between  the  stock  of  commodities  that  may  have  entered  his 
premises,  and  the  stock  that  has  been  really  sold  and  consumed  by  the  15 
public. 

10 

"This  list may be  regarded  as  including the  chief  articles  of  luxury  of  the 
operative  classes,"  and  down  The  Economist puts  it  to the  account of these 
classes.  Now, one of these articles, viz., coffee, enters but sparingly into the 
consumption  of  the  English  operative,  and  wine  does  not enter it at all.  Or  20 
does  The  Economistthink  the  operative  classes  must  be  better  off  because 
their  masters  are  consuming more  wine  and coffee in  1853  than in  1852? As 
to  tea,  it  is  generally  known  that,  consequent  upon  the  Chinese  revolution 
and  the  commercial  disturbances  connected  with  it,  a  speculative  demand 
has sprung up based on the apprehensions for the future, but not on the wants 25 
of the  present.  As to  sugar, the whole difference between October,  1852 and 
1853,  amounts  but  to  324,261 c w t;  and  I  don't  pretend  to  the  omniscience 
of  The  Economist,  which  knows,  of  course,  that  not  one  cwt.  out  of these 
324,261  has  entered the  stocks  of  the  shop-keeper or the  sweetmeats  of the 
upper  classes,  but that  all  of  them  must have inevitably found their  way to  30 
the  tea of the operative.  Bread being dear, he will have fed his  children upon 
sugar, as Marie Antoinette, during the famine of 1788, told the French people 
to  Uve  upon macaroons.  As  to  the  rise  in the import of tobacco, the demand 
for  this  article  on  the  part  of the  operatives  regularly  increases in the  same 
proportion as  they  are thrown out of work, and their regular course of living  35 
is  interrupted. 

Above  aU,  we  must  not  forget  that  the  amount of  commodities  imported 
in  October,  1853,  was  determined  not by  the  actual demand of that month, 
but  by  a  conjectural  demand  calculated  on  an  altogether  different  state  of 
the home  market.  So  much for the first table  and its "connection with other  40 
most  important  features  of  the  times."

To  The  Economist  the  glorious  discovery  was  certainly  reserved  that,  in 
years  of  dearth  and  imminent  famine,  the  relative  excess  of  imports  above 
those  of common years, of provisions, rather proves the sudden development 
of  consumption  than  the  unusual  falling  off  of  production.  The  sudden  rise 
in  the  price  of  an  article  is  no  doubt a premium  on its  importation.  But has 
any  one  ever  contended  that  the  dearer  an  article  the  more  eagerly  it  will 
be  consumed?  We  come  now  to  a  third  class  of  importations,  constituting 
the  raw  materials  of  manufactures:

As  the  production  of  1853  has  largely  surpassed  that  of  1852,  more  raw 
materials  were  wanted,  imported,  and  worked  up.  The  Economist,  however, 
does  not  pretend  that  the  surplus  of  manufactures  produced  in  1853  has 
entered  the  home  consumption.  He  puts  it  to  the  account of  exports.  "The 
most  important  fact  is  the  enormous  increase  in  our  exports.  The  increase 
upon  the  single  months  ending  the  10th  October  is  no  less  than £1,446,708, 
completing  an  aggregate 
increase  of  £12,596,291;  the  amount  being 
£66,987,729 in the present year, against £54,391,438 in the corresponding year 

493 

Karl  Marx 

of  1852  . ..  Taking  only  our  exports  of  British produce,  the  increase  is  no 
less  than  23  per  cent,  in  the  year." 

But how  does  it  stand with these  additional £12,596,291.  "A large portion 
of these  exports  are  only  on the  way to their ultimate markets," where they 
will  arrive  just  at  the  proper  moment  to  completely  undo  them.  "A  con- 
siderable part of the increase is to Australia," which is glutted; "to the United 
States,"  which  are  overdone;  "to  India,"  which  is  depressed;  "to  South 
America,"  which  is  altogether  unable  to  absorb  the  over-imports  repelled 
from  the  other  markets. 

5 

"The  enormous  increase  of  articles  imported  and  consumed,  is  already  10 

paid by this  country,  or the bills  drawn for them are ninning and will be paid 
in  a  very  short  period  . ..  When  shall  we  be  paid  for  the  exports?  In  six 
months,  nine  months,  twelve  months,  and  for  some  in  eighteen  months  or 
two  years'  time."  It  "is  but  a  question of  time,"  says  The Economist.  What 
an error! 

15 

If you throw  this enormous  surplus of manufactures upon markets already 
inundated  by  your  exports,  the  time  you  wait  for,  may  never arrive.  What 
appears  in your tables as an enormous list of imaginary wealth, may turn out 
an  enormous  list  of real  losses,  a list of bankruptcies on a world-wide  scale. 
What then do table No. III.  and the boasted figures of exports prove? What  20 
all  of  us  were  long  since  aware  of,  that  the  industrial  production  of  Great 
Britain has  enormously increased in  1853, that it has overshot the mark, and 
that its  movement of expansion is becoming accelerated at the very moment 
when  markets  are  contracting. 

25 

The Economist arrives,  of  course,  at an opposite result.  "The pressure on 
the  Money  Market,  and the  rise in the  rate  of interest,"  he tells us,  "are but 
the  transitory  consequence  of  the  large  imports  being  immediately  paid, 
while  the  enormous  surplus  of  exports  is  advanced on credit." In his eyes, 
then,  the  tightness  of  the  Money  Market  is  but  the  result of  the  additional 
amount of exports.  But we  may as justly  say that in these latter months the  30 
increase  of  exports  has  been but the  necessary  result of  the pressure on the 
Money  Market.  That  pressure  was  attended  by  an  influx  of  bullion and  an 
adverse  exchange—but is  an adverse exchange not a premium on bills drawn 
on  foreign  countries,  or  in  other  words,  a  premium  on  exportation?  It  is 
precisely by virtue of this  law  that England, in times of pressure on her own  35 
Money Market,  deranges all the other markets of the world, and periodically 
destroys  the  industry of foreign countries, by bombarding them with British 
manufactures  at  reduced  prices. 

The  Economisthas  now  found  out  the  "two  points"  in which  the  working-
men are decidedly wrong, decidedly blameable and foolish. "In the first place 
they  are  at  issue,  in  most  cases,  on  the  merest  fraction of  a  coin."  Why  is 

40 

494 

Prosperity—The  Labor Question 

this?  Let  The  Economist  answer  himself:  "The  dispute  has  been  changed 
from  being a question of contract to being a  struggle for power."  "Secpndly, 
the  operatives  have  not  managed their  own business, but have  submitted to 
the  dictation  of  irresponsible,  if  not  self-styled leaders  . ..  They have  acted 
in combination,  and through a body  of insolent clubs  . ..  We  do not fear the 
political  opinions  of  the  working  classes  themselves;  but  we  do  fear  and 
deprecate  those  of  the  men  whom  they  allow to  prey upon them  and  speak 
for  them." 

To  the  class-organization of  their  masters  the  operatives  have responded 
by  a  class-organization  of  their  own;  and  The  Economist teils  them  that  he 
will  discontinue  "to  fear"  them,  if  they  dismiss  their  generals  and  then-
officers  and  resolve  to  fight  single-handed.  Thus  the  mouth-pieces  of  the 
allied  despots  of  the  north  assured  the  world  again  and  again,  during  the 
period of the first  struggles of the  French revolution, that they did "not fear" 
the  French  people  itself,  but  only  the  political  opinions  and  the  political 
actions  of  the  savage  Comité  du  Salut  Public,  the  insolent  clubs,  and  the 
troublesome  generals.

In  my  last  letter  I  told  The  Economist that  it  was  not  to  be  wondered  at 
if the  working  classes  had  not used the  period of prosperity to educate their 
children  and  themselves.  I  am  now  enabled  to  forward  you  the  following 
statement,  the  names  and particulars  of which have been given  me,  and  are 
about  to  be  sent  to  Parliament:  In  the  last week of  September,  1852,  in the

Boys of nine and ten working 60 hours consecutively, with the exception of 
three  hours'  rest!  Let  the  masters  say  nothing  about  neglecting education 
now.  One  of  the  above,  Ann  B.,  a  little  girl  only  nine  years  of  age,  fell  on 

495 

Karl Marx 

the  floor  asleep  with  exhaustion,  during  the  60  hours;  she  was roused and 
cried,  but  was  forced  to  resume  work!! 

The factory operatives  seem resolved to take the  education movement out 
of  the  hands  of the  Manchester humbugs.  At a meeting held in the  Orchard 
by the  unemployed  operatives  at Preston,  as  we  hear: 

5 

"Mrs. Margaret  Fletcher  addressed  the  assembly  on  the  impropriety  of 
married  females  working  in  factories  and  neglecting  their  children  and 
household duties. Every man was entitled to a f ah day's wages for a fair day's 
work,  by  which  she  meant,  that  he  ought  to  have  such remuneration  for his 
labor  as  would  afford  him  the  means  of  maintaining  himself  and  family  in  10 
comfort;  of  keeping  his  wife  at  home  to  attend  to  domestic  duties,  and  of 
educating  his  children.  (Cheers.)  The  speaker  concluded  by  moving  the 
annexed  resolution: 

Resolved,  That  the  married  portion  of  the  females  in  this  town  do  not 
intend  to  go  to  work  again  until  their  husbands  are  fairly  and  fully  re-  15 
numerated  for  their  labor. 

Mrs. Ann  Fletcher  (sister  of  the  last speaker)  seconded the resolution and 

it  was  carried  unanimously. 

The  Chairman announced that when the  10 per cent,  question was  settled, 
there would be such an agitation raised respecting the employment of married  20 
women  in  factories  as  the  mill  owners  of  the  country  little  expected." 

Ernest Jones,  in  his  tour  through the  manufacturing districts,  is  agitating 
for  a  "Parliament  of  Labor."  He  proposes  that "a delegation from all trades 
shall  assemble  in  the  center  of  action,  in  Lancashire,  in  Manchester,  and 
remain  sitting  until the  victory  is  obtained. This would be an expression of  25 
opinion  so  authoritative  and comprehensive  as  would fill the world with its 
voice,  and  divide  with  St. Stephen's the  columns  of the  press  . ..  At  a crisis 
like  this  the  ear  of  the world would hang more on the words of the humblest 
of  those  delegates  than  on  those  of  the  coroneted  senators  of  the  loftiest 
House."  The  organ  of  Lord  Palmerston  is  of  a  quite  different  opinion:  30' 
"Among  ourselves,"  exclaims  The  Morning Post,  "the  boasted progress has 
been effectually checked, and  since the wretched failure of the  10th of April 
no  further  attempt  has  been  made  to  convert  laborers  into  legislators,  or 
tailors  into  tribunes  of  the  people."

Progress  of  the  Turkish  War

Progress  of the Turkish War.

The  news  from  the  seat  of war, brought by the  steamer Humboldt, confirms 
the  report  previously  received  by  the  Europa  that  the  Turks,  after  having 
again  and  again  made  good  their  position  at  Oltenitza,  against heavy odds, 
and with hard fighting,  finally retired across the river about the  14th ult. and 
took up their position in their former entrenchments at Turtukai. We presume 
that  when  we  receive  our  letters  and  journals  this  will be  explained, but  at 
present  we  do  not altogether  understand  the  reason for the  movement.  It is 
stated  in  the  dispatch  that  it  was  accomplished  without  molestation,  which 
10  precludes  the  supposition  that  it  was  the  result  of  any  decided  advantage 
gained  by  Prince  Gorchakoff,  unless  indeed,  we  are  to  believe  that  the 
Russian  commander  had  succeeded  in  mustering  for  his  second  attack  on 
that place twice the force that he  had brought against it on the first.  But the 
truth is, that he  had no  such corps  of 45,000 men for  such a purpose, as will 
appear on a careful review of  all the facts in our possession. It is also  stated 
that  the  Turks  return  to  Turtukai,  in  order  not to  expose  themselves  to  the 
danger  of  a  surprize  at  Oltenitza  in  winter,  when  retreat  across  the  river 
would be difficult; but this  statement contradicts  the fact that they are acting 
on the offensive without a check hitherto and with undeniable preponderance 
20  of  forces.  Besides,  their  left wing  is  not  only  maintained  at Widdin, on the 
Wallachian  side  of  the  Danube,  but  is  even  strengthened,  which  indicates 
anything  but  a  general  retrograde  movement  on  their  part.  And,  taking the 
hypothesis  of  a  projected  movement,  with  a large  force,  across  the  river  at 
Ibraila or  Galatz, which is  probably true,  we  are at a loss to understand why 
25  Omer Pasha should withdraw his troops from the strong position at Oltenitza 
simply because  he  was  about, with another body of men, to move decisively 
against the  Russian left  flank.  But the  perplexities  of  the  case  will be better 
understood  by referring  to  the  events of the campaign since its beginning. 

It is certain first of all that the Turks were allowed to cross the river without 

497 

Friedrich  Engels 

serious  opposition,  both at Widdin and Turtukai.  There was nothing surpris­
ing in this, as military experience has established the impossibility of prevent­
ing  an  active  enemy from  crossing  a  river,  however large;  and  also, that it is 
always  most  advantageous  to  attack  him  after  he  has  got part  of  his  troops 
across—thus  falling  upon  them  with  a  superior  force,  and  while  they  have 
only  one  line  of  retreat  and  that  encumbered.  But  that  the  Turks  should 
establish themselves  upon the  left bank of  the  Danube;  that in  every  action 
fought  they  should  come  off  victorous;  that  they  should keep possession of 
Oltenitza,  not  more  than  forty  miles  from  Bucharest,  for  ten  days  without 
the  Russians  being  able  to  dislodge  them from that important position;  and 
that they  should finally retire from  it unmolested and of their own accord—all 
this  shows that the proportionate  strength of the Turkish and Russian forces 
opposed  to  each  other  in  that  quarter  has  been  greatly  mistaken.

We  know  pretty  accurately  what  forces  the  Turks  had  to  dispose  of;  but 
as  to  the  forces  of  the  Russians,  we  have  always  been  obliged  to  grope  in 
the  dark.  Two  Army-Corps,  it  was  stated,  had  crossed  the  Prath,  and  part 
of  a third followed  them  shortly afterward.  Supposing this  to be correct, the 
Russians  could  not  have  less  than  150,000  men  in  the  Principalities.  Now, 
however,  when  events  have  already  shown  that  there  is  no  such  Russian 
force  in  Wallachia—now  at last we  receive  an  authentic  account,  by way of 
Vienna,  of  what  they  really  have  there.  Their  forces  consist  of: 

15 

20 

1. The  Fourth Army-Corps,  under Gen. Dannenberg, consisting 

of  the  following  3  Divisions  of  infantry: 
A The  10th Division,  (Gen. Soimonoff) 
(Gen. 
Β

2.  One  brigade  of  the '14th  Division,  belonging  to 

the  Fifth  Army-Corps,  and  commanded  by  Gen. 
Engelhardt 
Total,  Infantry 

3.  Two  Divisions  of  light  horse,  commanded  by  Gen. Nirod 

and  Gen. Fischbach,  together  8,000 men, 
and  10  regiments  of  Cossacks,  6,000  men, 
making  in  all 

16,000  men

16,000  men 
1,000  men 

8,000 men  30 

57,000  men 

14,000  men  35 

4.  One Division of  Artillery,  of about one battery (12 guns) for every Infantry 

regiment,  or  altogether  170  to  180  guns. 

It also  appears, that the Fifth Army-Corps, that of Gen. Lüders, is not even 
concentrated  at  Odessa,  but  has  part  of  its  troops  at  Sevastopol,  and  part 

498 

Progress  of  the  Turkish  War.  About  November  17,  1853 

in the Caucasus; that the third Army-Corps under Gen. Osten-Sacken, is still 
in Volhynia, or at least has but just crossed the Pruth,  and cannot be brought 
down  to  the  theater  of  war  in  less  than  three  or  four  weeks;  and  that  the 
Russian cavalry of reserve—mostly heavy horse—are behind the Dnieper, and 
5  will  require  five  or  six weeks  to  march to  the  place where  they are wanted. 
This  information is  no  doubt correct;  and if  it had been before us  six weeks 
ago we should have said that Omer Pasha ought to pass the Danube, no matter 
where  or  how,  but  the  sooner  the  better. 

There  is,  in  fact,  nothing  which  can  rationally  explain  the  foolhardiness 
10  of the Russians.  To  march with  something like  80,000  men into  a cul-de-sac 
like  Wallachia,  to  stop  there  a  couple  of  months,  to  have,  as  the  Russians 
themselves  have  confessed,  about  15,000  men  sick  in hospital,  and to trust 
to good luck, without getting further reënf orcements, is a thing that has never 
been  done,  and  that  nobody  had  any  right  to  suspect  in  people  like  the 
15  Russians, who  are generally so  very cautious, and always take care to be on 
the  safe  side.  Why,  this  whole  available  army in  Wallachia,  after deducting 
for  detachments, would  only come to  some 46,000 men, who might, besides, 
be  wanted  at  different  points! 

But  such is  the  fact,  and we  can only explain it by  an absolute confidence 
20  on the part of the  Russians  in the  diplomatic intrigues  of their friends in the 
British  Government;  by  an unwarranted  contempt for  their  opponents,  and 
by the  difficulties  which the Russians  must find in concentrating large bodies 
of  troops  and  large  masses  of  stores  at  a  point  so  remote  from  the  center 
of  their  Empire. 

25 

30 

35 

40 

The  Turks,  on  the  other  hand,  are  25,000  strong  at  Kalafat,  in  Lesser 
Wallachia,  and  are  strengthening  that  force.  As  to  the  ulterior  movements 
of  this  corps  we  know  little.  They  seem  not  to  have  advanced  even  as  far 
as  Krajova, and indeed, to have done nothing more than occupy the neighbor 
ing  villages.  The  reason  for  this  is  also  doubtful,  and  we  can only  suppose 
that Omer Pasha is in some way controlled in his movements by the Council 
at  Constantinople, which originally  stationed those  25,000 men at Sophia. At 
any  rate,  as  far  as  it  is  possible  to judge  at this  distance, this corps is  quite 
useless  where  it is,  and its  presence  there  is  a mistake,  since even for hypo 
thetical  and improbable  use  against the  Servians, it is  as  we have  shown on 
a  former  occasion,  either  too  large  or  too  small.  It would  apparently  have 
been  far better  to  move  it lower  down the Danube; for it crossed on Oct. 28, 
and up to Nov.  15 it had not advanced much, or in any way operated actively. 
These  fifteen  days  might have been better  employed in  moving it  150  miles 
lower  down  the  Danube,  as  far  as  Sistova,  where  it  would  have  been  in 
immediate  connection  with the  left  wing  of  the  Turkish  grand  army,  and a 
couple  of  marches  more  would  have  brought  it  down  upon  Rustchuk,  the 

499 

Friedrich  Engels 

headquarters of the Turkish left. That these 25,000 men united with the main 
body  would  have  been  worth  twice  their  number  at  Kalaf  at  nobody  can 
doubt;  and  events  support this  opinion,  for,  as  before  stated,  we  have  not 
yet heard  that  during the  nineteen days  since  they crossed the Danube,  they 
have  given any  active  support to  Omer Pasha. 

5 

The attacks of the Turks at Nicopolis and Rustchuk were mere feints. They 
appear to have been well executed, with no  more troops than was necessary, 
and  yet  with  that  vigor  which  is  apt  to  lead  an  enemy  into  error  as  to  the 
ulterior  objects  of  the  attacking  party.  The  main  attack  was  at  Oltenitza. 
What force they brought there is even now uncertain. Some reports say that  10 
as  early  as the  11th the  Turks  had 24,000 men at Oltenitza, and the Russians 
35,000  to  oppose  them.  But  this  is  evidently  false.  If  the  Russians  were 
stronger  than  the'Turks  in  the  proportion of three to two, they  would have 
very  soon  sent  them  back to  the  other  side  of the  Danube, when the fact is 
that the  11th  saw  a Russian  defeat. 

15 

It  would  seem  now  as  much  as  ever  that  nothing  but  exceedingly  bad 
generalship  can prevent the Turks from driving Gorchakoff out of Wallachia. 
It  is  certain,  however,  that  there  have  been  some  singular  specimens  of 
generalship  on  both  sides.  On  the  2d  of  November  the  Turks  crossed  at 
Oltenitza—evidently their main point of passage.  In the  3d, 4th and 5th they  20 
successfully  repulsed  the  attacks  of the  Russians, thereby  estabh^liing then-
superiority  upon the  left bank of  the  Danube.  During these  three  days  their 
reenforcements  ought to  have  arrived,  and  they  ought to have been  at  once 
in  a  position  to  march  upon  Bucharest.  This  was  the  way  Napoleon acted, 
and  every  general  since  his  time  has  known that rapidity  of  movement can  25 
in  itself  make  up  for  deficiency  of  strength,  inasmuch  as  you fall upon your 
opponent  before he  has time  to  concentrate his forces.  Thus,  as  men  say in 
trade,  Time  is  money;  so  we  may  say  in  war,  Time  is  troops.  But  here  in 
Wallachia,  this  maxim  is  neglected.  The  Turks  quietly  keep  possession  of 
Oltenitza  during  nine  days,  from  the  6th  to  the  15th,  and  excepting  petty  30 
skirmishes,  nothing  at  all  is  done,  so  that  the  Russians  have  time  to  con 
centrate  their  forces,  to  dispose  them  as  maturely  as  possible,  and  if  their 
line  of retreat is menaced, to restore and secure it. Or are we to suppose that 
Omer Pasha intended merely to keep the Russians near Oltenitza till his main 
army  had  crossed  lower  down  and  entirely  intercepted their  retreat?  Pos-  35 
sibly, though this is an operation which, with 25,000 men at Kalaf at and 24,000 
at  Oltenitza,  presupposes  some  50,000  more  lower  down  toward  Hirsova. 
Now, if  he  had  such a force there, as very possibly he may, they might have 
passed the time much better than in all these artificial and subtle maneuvers. 
In  that  case,  why  not  throw  70,000  or  80,000  men  in one  mass  across  the  40 
Danube  at  Ibraila,  and  cut the  Russians  in  Wallachia off  at  once  from their 

500 

Progress of the Turkish War. About November 17, 1853 

communications?  As we  have  said, it is  probable that this movement is now 
to  be  made,  but  why  this  long  delay,  and  why  these  complicated  pre 
liminaries, does not appear. With so great a preponderance of force  all ready 
on the  line  of operations,  there  was  no  particular  advantage to  be gained by 
5  deceiving  Prince  Gorchakoff.  He  should  rather  have  been  cut  off  and 

crushed  at  once. 

As to the Turkish soldiers themselves, in the few engagements where they 
have  acted,  they  have  so  far  come  out  in  capital  style.  The  artillery  has 
everywhere  proved  that  the  Emperor  Nicholas  did  not exaggerate  when  he 
10  pronounced it among the best in Europe.  A battalion of riflemen, organized 
only  ten  weeks  before  the  beginning  of  hostilities,  and  armed  with  Minié 
rifles,  then just  arrived from  France, has,  during this  short time, gained high 
proficiency  in  the  skkmishing  service,  and  furnished  first-rate  marksmen, 
who  well  know  how  to  use  that  formidable  weapon;  at  Oltenitza  they  had 
an opportunity of showing this by picking off almost all the superior officers 
of the Russians. The infantry in general must be quite capable of the ordinary 
line  and  column  movements,  and  besides,  must  have  attacked  at  Oltenitza 
with  great  courage  and  steadiness,  as  at least on two  days  out of three,  the 
charge  of the  Turkish  infantry  decided  the battle, and that at close  quarters; 
20  and  with  the  bayonet,  the  Russian  infantry,  it  is  well-known,  are  no  con 

15 

temptible  opponents. 

25 

The  news  from  Asia  is  even  more  decisively  in favor  of  the  Turks  than 
that  from  Europe.  It  appears  certain  that  there  has  been  a  general  and 
combined rising of  the  Circassian  tribes against the Russians; that they hold 
the  Gates  of  the  Caucasus,  and  that  Prince  Woronzoff  has  his  com 
munications  cut  off  in  the  rear,  while  he  is  pressed  by  the  Turkish forces 
in front.  Thus  the  war  everywhere  opens  with  disasters  for the Czar.  Let us 
hope that such may be its history to the end, and that the Russian Government 
and  people  may be  taught by it to restrain their ambition and arrogance, and 

30  mind  their  own business  hereafter.

Der  Ritter vom  edelmütigen  Bewußtsein 

|2|  Der  Mann  des  kleinen  Kriegs  (siehe  Deckers  Theorie  des kleinen Kriegs) 
braucht  kein  edler  Mann  zu  sein,  aber  er  muß  doch  ein  edelmüthiges  Be 
wußtsein haben.  Das  edelmüthige  Bewußtsein  schlägt nach Hegel nothwen-
dig  in  das  niederträchtige um.  Diesen  Umschlag werde  ich  erläutern  an  den 
5  Ergüssen  des  Herrn Willich — Peter der Einsiedler und Walther von Habe 
nichts in einer Person. Ich beschränke mich auf den Cavaliere della Ventura; 
seine hinter ihm stehenden Cavalieri del dente überlasse ich ihrer Mission. 

10 

Um  von  vorne  herein  einzuprägen,  daß  das  edelmüthige  Bewußtsein die 
Wahrheit  im  „höheren"  Sinn  durch die Lüge im  „gewöhnlichen"  Sinn aus-
zudrücken  pflegt,  beginnt  Herr  Willich  seine  Antwort  auf  meine  „Enthül 
lungen"  mit  den  Worten:  „Dr. Carl  Marx  gab  in  der  Neu-England-  und 
Criminal-Zeitung  einen  Bericht  über  den  Kölner  Communistenprozeß." 
Nie  habe  ich  der  Criminal-Zeitung  einen Bericht über  den Kölner  Commu 
nistenprozeß  gegeben.  Es  ist  bekannt,  daß  ich  der  Neu-England-Zeitung 
15  die  „Enthüllungen" und Herr Willich der Criminal-Zeitung Hirsch's Selbst 

bekenntnisse  gab. 

Pag. 11  der  „Enthüllungen"  heißt es:  „Aus  der Aufzählung der der Partei 
Willich-Schapper  entwandten  Documente  und  aus  den Daten  dieser  Docu 
mente  folgt,  daß  diese  Partei,  obgleich  durch  den  Einbruch  des  Reuter ge-
20  warnt,  noch  fortwährend  Mittel  fand,  sich  Documente  stehlen  und  sie  an 
die preußische Polizei gelangen zu lassen."  Pag. 64 wird diese Stelle rekapi-
tulirt. 

„Herr  Marx",  antwortete  Herr Willich, „weiß sehr wohl, daß diese Doku 

mente  selbst  meistens  gefälscht,  theilweise  erfunden waren." 

25 

Meistens  gefälscht;  also  nicht  ganz gefälscht.  Theilweise  erfunden;  also 

nicht  ganz  erfunden.  Herr  Willich  gesteht  also:  Nach  wie  vor  dem  Reu-
ter'schen  Diebstahl  fanden  seiner  Fraktion  angehörige  Documente  ihren 
Weg  zur  Polizei.  Wie  ich behaupte. 

Der  Edelmuth  des  Herrn  Willich  besteht  nun  darin,  hinter  der  richtigen 
falsches  Bewußtsein  auszuwittern.  „Herr  Marx  weiß." 
Thatsache  ein

Karl Marx 

Woher  weiß  Herr Willich,  was  Herr  Marx weiß? Von einigen der fraglichen 
Dokumente  weiß  ich,  daß  sie  echt  sind.  Von  keinem  derselben  weiß  ich, 
daß  es  sich  während  der  Prozeßverhandlungen  als verfälscht oder erfunden 
auswies.  Aber  ich  hätte  „mehr"  wissen  sollen,  da  „ein  gewisser  Blum  der 
in  Willich's  nächster  Umgebung  befindliche  Berichterstatter  von  Marx" 
war.  Blum blühte  also  in der nächsten Umgebung von Willich. Desto weiter 
ab  hielt er  sich mir vom Leibe.  Was  ich von Blum weiß,  den ich nie gespro 
chen,  selbst  nicht  durch  die  Blume,  beschränkt  sich  darauf,  daß  Blum  ein 
Russe  von  Geburt und ein  Schuster von Handwerk sein soll, daß er auch als 
Morisson figurirt,  auf  Wilhch'sche  Morrison-Pillen  schwört,  und  sich jetzt 
wahrscheinhch  in  Australien  befindet.  Ueber  die  Wirksamkeit  des  Willich-
Kinkel'schen  Missionärs  wurde  ich  von  Magdeburg  aus  benachrichtigt, 
nicht in London.  Das  edelmüthige Bewußtsein konnte  sich daher die jeden 
falls  schmerzliche  Operation  ersparen,  einen  seiner  Söhne  im  Glauben auf 
bloßen Verdacht hin  öffentlich zu verunglimpfen. |

15 

|3|  Erst lügt mir  das  edelmüthige Bewußtsein einen eingebildeten Bericht 
erstatter  an;  dann lügt es  nur einen wirklichen Brief  ab.  Es  citirt:  „Seite 69, 
der  Enthüllungen,  Bemerkung  A,  aus  dem  vorgeschützten Briefe  Beckers." 
Herr  Willich ist zu  edelmüthig vorauszusetzen,  daß  „ein  Mann von Geist 
und  Charakter",  wie  Becker  den  Geist  und  Charakter  in einem  Manne wie  20 
Willich  verkennen  darf.  Er  verwandelt  daher  Becker's  Brief  in  einen  vor 
geschützten und  mich in  einen  Falsclimünzer.  Aus  Edelmuth, versteht sich. 
Der  vorgeschützte  Brief  existirt  noch  immer  im  Besitze  des  Advokaten 
Schneider  II.  Ich  schickte  ihn  der  Vertheidigung  zur  Zeit  des  Processes 
nach  Köln,  weil  er  jede  Theilnahme  Beckers  an  den  Willich'sehen  Narr-  25 
heiten  widerlegt.  Nicht  nur  ist  der  Brief  von  Becker  geschrieben,  Kölner 
und  Londoner  Poststempel  constatiren  sein  Datum  der  Absendung  und 
des  Empfangs. 

„Vorher  aber  schrieb  Frau  Kinkel  einen  längeren  berichtigenden  Brief 
an  mich  (Willich);  Becker  in  Köln übernahm  die  Besorgung.  Er  theilte  ihr  30 
mit,  der  Brief  sei  besorgt,  — ich  habe  ihn  nie  gesehen.  Hat  ihn  Herr Marx, 
Becker,  oder  die  Post  bewahrt?}" 

Nicht  die  Post,  demonstrirte  Willich.  Vielleicht  Becker?  So  lange  er  in 
Freiheit,  fragte  kein  Willich  bei  ihm  an.  Also  „Herr  Marx".  Herr  Willich 
läßt  mich,  in  seiner  stillen Weise,  die Briefe,  die  Becker  mir  nicht schreibt,  35 
veröffentlichen  und  die  Briefe,  die  er  mir  zur  Besorgung anvertraut, unter 
schlagen.  Leider  war  Becker  so  freundlich,  mich  niemals  mit  Commission 
von Episteln,  sei es  der  Frau Johann,  sei es  des  Herrn Johann Gottfried, zu 
behelligen.  Anfragen an Becker von  so gleichgültigem Inhalt steht weder das 
Gef ängniß im Wege, noch das schwarze Cabinet. Herr Willich verlügt sich in 40 
die  schmutzige  Insinuation,  aus  der  reinen Absicht zur Tugend  anzufeuern 

508 

Der  Ritter vom  edelmütigen  Bewußtsein 

und  die  Wahlverwandtschaft  zwischen  den  Guten,  zwischen  den  Kinkels

stellen.

„Die  Parteistellung  innerhalb  des  Proletariats  zwischen  der  Partei  Marx 
und  Willich-Schapper,  nach  der  Bezeichnung  des  Herrn  Marx,  nicht  der 
meinigen." 

Das  edelmüthige  Bewußtsein  muß  die  eigene  Bescheidenheit  durch  die 
fremde  Ueberhebung  beweisen.  Es  verwandelt  daher  die  „Bezeichnung des 
Kölner  Anklageakts"  (siehe  pag.  6  der  Enthüllungen)  in  „Bezeichnungen  des 

10  Herrn  Marx".  Aus  Bescheidenheit  verwandelt  es  gleichfalls  die  Partei 
stellung  innerhalb  einer  bestimmten  geheimen deutschen Gesellschaft,  von 
der  ich  spreche  (siehe  1. c ),  in  die  „Parteistellung  innerhalb  des  Proleta 
riats". 

„Als  Techow  im  Herbst  1850  nach  London  kam,  —  ließ Marx  sich  von 
15  Dronke  schreiben,  Techow  habe  über  mich  die  wegwerfendsten  Aeußerun-
gen  gemacht;  der  Brief  wurde  verlesen.  Techow  kam  an,  wir  sprachen uns 
als  Männer  gegen  einander  aus,  die  im  Briefe  gemachten  Mittheilungen 
waren  erfunden!!" 

Als Techow  nach London kam, ließich mir von Dronke  schreiben,  empfing 
20  den  Brief,  verlas  ihn,  und  dann  kam  Techow.  Die  falsche  consecutio  tem-
porum  spiegelt die Verlegenheit des edelmüthigen Bewußtseins ab, das einen 
falschen Causalnexuß  zwischen mir, Dronke's  Brief und Techow's Kommen 
hervorzubringen  sucht.  In Dronke's  Brief,  der  übrigens  an Engels und nicht 
an  mich  addressirt  ist,  lautet  die  verbrecherische  Stelle  wörtlich:  „Heute 
25  habe ich Techow etwas umgestimmt, obwohl ich dabei mit ihm und Schily" 
—  Schily  befindet  sich  in  diesem  Augenblicke  in  London  —  „in einen heftigen 
Disput  gerieth und  er wiederholt die  Angriffe auf Sigel als persönlichen Ulk 
von  Wülich,  dem  er  beiläufig  auch  das  allergeringste  militärische  Talent 
abspricht,  erklärte."  Dronke  spricht  also  nicht  von  den  wegwerfendsten 
30  Aeußerungen  Techow's  im  Allgemeinen,  sondern  seinen  wegwerfenden 
Aeußerungen  über  Herrn  Wilhch's  militärisches  Talent.  Hat Techow  daher 
etwas  für  erfunden  erklärt,  so  waren  es  nicht  die  in  Dronke's  Briefe  ge 
machten  Mittheilungen,  sondern  die  Mittheilungen  des  edlen  Bewußtseins 
über  Dronke's  Mittheilungen.  Techow  hat  in  London  seine  Schweizer 
35  Auffassung  von ||4| Herrn  Wilhch's  militärischem  Talent  nicht  modificirt, 
wenn  auch  vielleicht  andere  Anschauungen,  die  er  vom  falschen  Asceten 
besaß.  Mein  Zusammenhang  mit  Dronke's  Brief  und  Techow's  Kommen 
beschränkt  sich  also  darauf,  daß ich Dronke's  Brief verlas,  wie ich  als Prä 
sident  der  Centraibehörde  alle  Briefe  zu  verlesen  hatte.  So  unter  andern 
einen Brief von Karl Brunn, worin auch der sich über Wilhch's militärisches 
Talent  erlustigte.  Herr  Willich  war  damals  überzeugt,  daß  ich  Bruhn  den 

40 

509 

Karl Marx 

Brief  schreiben ließ.  Da  Bruhn aber noch nicht wie Techow nach Australien 
abgereist  ist,  unterdrückt  Herr  Willich  vorsichtig  „diese  Probe  meiner 
Taktik".  So  hatte  ich  einen  Brief  zu  verlesen,  worin  Rothacker  schreibt: 
,  Jeder  andern  Gemeinde,  —  aber  dieser  (nämlich  Willich's)  niemals  —  will 
ich angehören." Er erzählt, wie er durch einfache Opposition gegen Willich's 
Ansichten  über  „die  auffallenden  Rüstungen  Preußens"  das  Schicksal  sich 
zuzog,  daß  einer  der  Trabanten  Willich's  seine  „sofortige  Ausstoßung  aus 
dem  Bunde  verlangte,  — und  ein anderer  eine  Commission ernannt wissen 
wollte,  zu  prüfen,  wie  denn  dieser Rothacker in  den Bund gekommen wäre, 
das  sei  verdächtig". Herr Willich war überzeugt, daß ich Rothacker den Brief 
schreiben tieß. Da aber  Rothacker  statt  Gold bei  Melbourne zu graben, eine 
Zeitung in Cincinnati herausgiebt,  fand  Herr Wilhch es  wieder passend,  die 
Welt um  diese  andere  „Probe  meiner  Taktik"  zu  prellen.

Das  edelmüthige  Bewußtsein  muß  seiner  Natur  nach  überall  Freude  an 
sich  erleben und  sich überall  anerkannt finden.  Findet es daher seine glück-  15 
liehe  Ansicht  von  sich verneint,  spricht Techow  ihm das militärische Talent 
ab oder Rothacker die politische Befähigung oder erklärt Becker es geradezu 
für  „dumm",  so  sind  diese  unnatürlichen  Erfahrungen  aus  dem  taktischen 
Gegensatz  von  Ahriman — Marx und Engels gegen Ormuzd — Wilhch prag 
matisch  zu  erklären,  und  der  Edelmuth  bethätigt  sich  demgemäß  in  der  20 
niederträchtigsten  Beschäftigung,  die  Geheimnisse  dieser  eingebildeten 
Taktik  auszuhecken,  auszubrüten,  auszulugen.  Wir  sehen,  sagt  Hegel,  wie 
dieses  Bewußtsein,  statt  mit  dem  Höchsten,  mit  dem  Niedrigsten,  nämlich 
mit  sich  selbst,  beschäftigt  ist. 

„Dies", ruft Herr Wilhch triumphirend aus, „sind einige Proben der Taktik  25 

des  Herrn  Marx." 

„Der  erste  Widerspruch  zwischen  Marx,  Engels und  mir  stellte  sich her 
aus,  als  von  den in  London  anwesenden  Männern  der  Revolution, die einen 
größern oder geringeren Wirkungskreis gehabt haben, die Einladung zu einer 
Versammlung  an uns  gerichtet wurde.  Ich  wollte  darauf eingehen; ich ver-  30 
langte,  daß  unsere  Parteistellung und  Organisation gesichert,  aber  der  éclat 
innerer  Zerwürfnisse  in  der  Emigration  nach  außen  hin  nicht  verbreitet 
werden  sollte.  Ich wurde  niedergestimmt,  die  Einladung abgelehnt,  und von 
dem  Tage  an  datiren  die  ekelhaften  Zerwürfnisse  in  der  Londoner  Emigra 
tion,  deren  Folgen  noch  heute  da  sind,  indeß  jetzt wohl  für die  öffentliche 
Meinung  alle  Bedeutung  verloren  haben." 

35 

Herr Wilhch als „Parteigänger" im Kriege, findet es auch im Frieden seiner 
Mission gemäß,  von  einer  Partei  zur  anderen  zu gehen,  und  es  ist völlig der 
Wahrheit  gemäß,  daß  seine  edelmüthigen Coahtionsgelüste  niedergestimmt 
wurden.  Das  Bekenntniß  ist  um  so  naiver,  als  Herr  Willich  später  zu  ver-  40 
breiten  suchte,  die  Emigration  habe  uns  von  ihrer  Zunftorganisation  aus-

510 

Der  Ritter  vom  edelmütigen  Bewußtsein 

geschlossen.  Hier  gesteht  er,  daß  wir  die  Emigrationszunft  von  uns  aus 
schlossen.  So  weit  die  Thatsache.  Nun  ihre  Verklärung.  Das  edelmüthige 
Bewußtsein  muß  nachzuweisen  suchen,  daß  es  nur durch Ahriman an dem 
edlen  Werk  verhindert  wurde,  allem  Bösen,  das  über  die  Emigration  ge-
5 kommen ist, vorzubeugen. Zu diesem Behuf e muß es sich wieder dem Lügen 
ergeben  mit  evangelistengemäßer  Verdrehung  der  profanen  Chronologie 
(siehe  Bruno  Bauer  „Synoptiker").  Ahriman—Marx, Engels erklärten ihren 
Austritt  aus  dem  Arbeitervereine  der  Great  Windmill  Street,  und  ihre 
Scheidung von Willich in der Sitzung der Centraibehörde vom 15. September 
10  1850.  Seit diesem  Tage  zogen  sie  sich  zurück von  allen öffentlichen Orga 
nisationen, Demon||5|strationen und Manifestationen. Also seit dem 15. Sept. 
1850.  Am  14. Juli  1851  wurden  „die  namhaften  Männer  aller  Fraktionen" 
zu  Bürger  Fickler  geladen,  am  20. Juli  1851  wurde  der  „Agitationsverein" 
gestiftet und  am 27. Juli  1851  der deutsche  „Emigrations-Club". Von diesem 
15  Tage  an,  wo  die  geheimen  Wünsche  des  edelmüthigen  Bewußtseins  sich 
erfüllten,  datiren  die  ekelhaften  Zerwürfnisse  der  „Londoner  Emigration", 
der  auf  beiden  Seiten  des  Ozeans  geführte  Kampf  zwischen  „Emigration" 
und  „Agitation",  der  große  Froschmäuslerkrieg  begann. 

20 

25 

„Wer  giebt  die  Worte  mir,  und  wer  die  Stimme 
Das  Größte  groß  und  würdig  zu  berichten? 
Denn  stolzerer  Kampf,  geführt  mit  wilderem  Grimme, 
Ward  seit  der  Welt  Beginn  gesehen  mit  Nichten; 
Die  andern  Schlachten,  wenn  auch noch  so  schlimme, 
Sind  Veilchen  nur  und  Rosen,  und  mein  Dichten 
Versagt  mir,  wo  Bravour  und  Ehrenglorie 
Gleich  herrlich  strahlt  in  dieses  K a m p fs  Historie." 

(Nach  Bojardo.  Orlando  Innam.  canto  27.) 

Die  „Bedeutung  dieser  ekelhaften  Zerwürfnisse"  hat in der  „öffentlichen 
Meinung"  nie  existirt,  sondern stets nur in der eigenen Meinung der Frosch-
30  mäusler.  Aber  „die  Folgen  sind noch  da".  Selbst Herrn WiHich's Dasein in 
Amerika  ist  eine  Folge.  Das  in  der  Form  der  Anleihe  von  Amerika  nach 
Europa  gewanderte  Geld  reiste  in  der  Form  Wiliich  von  Europa  nach 
Amerika  zurück.  Eins  seiner  ersten  Geschäfte  dort  war  die  Bildung  eines 
geheimen Committee's i n . . ., um den heiligen Gral, das demokratische Gold, 
35  dem  Gottfried  von  Bouillon  zu  sichern  und  Peter  dem  Einsiedler  gegen 

Arnold  Winkelried  Ruge  und  Melanchthon  Ronge. 

Obgleich die  „Edlen"  sich selbst überlassen, und nach dem Ausdrucke von 
Eduard  Meyen  Alle  vereinigt  waren  „bis  hinauf  zu  Bucher",  ging  der 
Scheidungsprozeß  nicht  nur  der  Hauptheere  unter  einander,  sondern  im 
Innern jedes Lagers  selbst so flott voran, daß der Agitationsverein bald auf 

40 

511 

Karl Marx 

ein  halbvollzähliges  Siebengestirn  reduzirt  war,  der  Emigrationsklub  aber, 
trotz  der  Bindekraft  des  edelmüthigen  Bewußtseins,  auf  die  Dreieinigkeit, 
Willich,  Kinkel und den Gastwirth Schärttner zusammenschmolz.  Selbst die 
dreieinige  Anleihe-Regentschaft  —  so  attraktiv  war  das  edelmüthige  Be 
wußtsein — verfiel in etwas, was nicht einmal ein Dualismus genannt werden 
kann,  nämlich  in  Kinkel-Wilhch.  Herr Reichenbach  war  zu  respektabel, um 
lange  der  Dritte  in  solchem  Bunde  bleiben  zu  können.  Er  hat  den  „per 
sönlichen  Charakter"  des  edelmüthigen  Bewußtseins  praktisch  kennen 
gelernt. 

5 

Unter  den Proben,  die  das  edelmüthige Bewußtsein von der  „Taktik von  10 

Marx"  gjebt,  befinden  sich  auch  seine  Erlebnisse  mit  Engels.  Ich  lege  an 
dieser  Stehe  einen  Brief  von  Engels  selbst  ein. 

„Manchester,  den  23. Nov.  1853.  In  dem  Roman,  den  Herr  August  Willich 
in  der  New-Yorker  Criminalzeitung  (d. d.  28. Oct.  und  4. Nov.)  zu  seiner 
Rechtfertigung  veröffentlicht  hat,  habe  auch  ich  die  Ehre  zu  figuriren.  Ich 
bin  genöthigt,  ein  Paar  Worte  über  diese  Angelegenheit,  so  weit  sie  mich 
betrifft,  zu  Protokoll  zu  geben. 

15 

20 

Daß  Freund  Wilhch,  der  den reinen  Müßiggang  mit  der  reinen Thätigkeit 
verwechselt,  und  sich  daher  ausschließlich  mit  Freund  Wilhch beschäftigt, 
für Alles, was  seine Person betrifft, ein vortreffliches Gedächtniß hatte, daß 
er eine Art Register führte über jede Bemerkung, die  selbst im Schoppenste 
chen  der  Gesellschaft  in  Beziehung  auf  ihn  fiel,  das  war  denen längst kein 
Geheimniß  mehr,  die  sich  seines  Umgangs  erfreuten.  Freund Wilhch wußte 
aber  von jeher  sein Gedächtniß und  sein Register sehr gut zu benutzen.  Eine 
kleine Verdrehung, einige scheinbar unbeabsichtigte Auslassungen machten  25 
ihn, wenn  dergleichen Bagatellen wieder  zur  Sprache  kamen, jedesmal zum 
Helden  des  dramatischen  Ereignisses,  zum  Mittelpunkt  einer Gruppe, eines 
lebenden Bildes.  Im  Detail, wie  im  Ganzen  des Wülich'schen Romans dreht 
sich  der  Kampf  überall  und  immer  um  den  unbeleckten  und  deshalb  an 
gefeindeten  Wilhch.  In  jeder  einzelnen  Episode  finden  wir  am  Schluß  den  30 
braven  Wilhch  eine  Rede  haltend,  und  die  verruchten  Gegner  geknickt, 
gebrochen, zertreten, zurücksinkend in das Bewußtsein ihrer Nichtigkeit. Et 
cependant  on  vous  connaît,  ô  chevaliers  sans  peur  et  sans  reproche! 

In  dem  Wilhch'sehen  Roman  ist  also  die  Leidensepoche,  während  deren 
der  Edele||6|so  viel  Unbill  zu  erdulden  hatte  von  Marx,  Engels  und  den  35 
übrigen  Gottlosen,  zu  gleicher  Zeit  eine  Epoche  des  Triumphs,  worin  er 
jedesmal  seine  Gegner  siegreich  niedertritt,  und  jeder  neue  Triumph  alle 
früheren  übergipfelt.  Freund  Willich  schildert  sich  einerseits  als  leidenden 
Christus,  der  die  Sünden  von  Marx,  Engels  &  Comp,  auf  sich  nahm,  an 
dererseits  aber  als  den Christus,  der da kam, zu richten die Lebendigen und  40 

512 

Der  Ritter vom  edelmütigen  Bewußtsein 

die  Todten.  Es  war  Freund  Wülich  vorbehalten,  zwei  so  widersprechende 
Rollen  gleichzeitig in  Einer  Person  zu  vereinigen.  Wer  diese  beiden  Phasen 
gleichzeitig  repräsentirt,  dem  muß  man  doch  wahrlich  glauben. 

Für  uns,  die  wir  diese  selbstgefälligen  Phantasieen,  womit  ein  ältlicher 
5  Hagestolz  seine  schlaflosen Nächte  ausfüllt,  längst  auswendig konnten,  für 
uns  ist  nur  das  erstaunlich,  daß  alle  die  Idiosynkrasien  heute  noch  in  der 
selben  unveränderten  Form  auftauchen,  wie  Anno  1850.  Nun  zu  den  De 
tails. 

Freund  Willich,  der  die  Herren  Stieber  und  Consorten  in  Agenten  einer 
10  deutschen  ,Bundescentralpolizei'  verwandelt,  die  seit den uralten Demago 
gengeschichten  nicht  mehr  existirt  hat,  der  eine  Menge  anderer  ebenso 
wundersamer  ,Fakta'  erzählt,  behauptet  auch  mit üblicher  Genauigkeit,  ich 
habe  eine  ,Broschüre'  über  die  badische  Campagne  von  1849  geschrieben. 
Freund Wülich, der den Theil meiner Arbeit, worin er vorkommt, mit seltener 
15  Gründlichkeit  studirt  hat,  weiß  sehr  wohl,  daß  ich  nie  eine  derartige  ,Bro-
schüre'  vom  Stapel ließ.  Was ich  schrieb,  war eine Reihe  von Artikeln über 
die  Reichsverfassungs-Campagne  in  der  Revue  ,Neue  Rheinische  Zeitung, 
Hamburg  und  New-York  1850',  in  deren  einem  ich  meine  Erfahrungen 
während  der  pfälzisch-badischen  Campagne  veröffentlichte.  In  diesem 
20  Artikel  figurili  natürlich  auch  Freund  Willich,  und  wie  er  sagt,  war  dieser 
Artikel für ihn ,sehr anerkennend', brachte ihn aber  sogleich in Conflikte mit 
seiner  habituellen  Bescheidenheit,  indem  er  ihn  gleichsam  zum  Konkur 
renten der  andern so  vielen großen Staatsmänner, Diktatoren und Feldherrn' 
machte. 

25 

Und  worin  bestand  die  große  ,Anerkennung'  meinerseits,  die  jetzt  dem 
edlen  Herzen  Willich's  so  wohlthut?  Darin,  daß  ich  den  Herrn  Willich  als 
einen  unter  Umständen  recht brauchbaren Bataillonschef  ,anerkannte',  der 
in  den 20 Jahren,  wo  er preußischer Lieutenant war,  sich  die  dazu nöthigen 
Kenntnisse  erworben;  der  für  den  kleinen  und  speziell  für  den  Parteigän-
30  gerkrieg  nicht  ohne  Anlagen  war,  und  der  endlich  den  Vortheil  hatte,  daß 
er  als  Führer  eines  Freicorps  von  6—700  Mann  sich  ganz  an  seinem  Platze 
befand,  während die  Mehrzahl der höheren Offiziere in jener Campagne  aus 
Subjekten  bestand,  die  entweder  gar  keine,  oder  doch  eine  ihrer  Stellung 
durchaus unangemessene militairische Büdung besaßen.  Zu sagen, daß Herr 
35  Willich 700  Mann besser führen konnte, als  der erste beste  Student,  Unter 

offizier,  Schulmeister  und  Schuster,  ist  allerdings  ,sehr  anerkennend'  für 
einen preußischen Lieutenant, der 20 Jahre Zeit zur Vorbereitung hatte ! Dans 
le  royaume  des  aveugles le borgne  est  roi.  Und daß  er in  seiner untergeord 
neten Position weniger Verantwortlichkeit trug,  also  weniger Fehler machen 
40  konnte,  als  ,seine  Conkurrenten',  die Divisionäre oder Obergenerale waren, 
versteht sich doch von selbst. Wer weiß, ob Sigel, der als ,ObergeneraP nicht 

513 

Karl Marx 

am  Platze  war,  als  einfacher  Bataillonschef  nicht  auch  etwas  geleistet 
hätte? 

Und  nun die wehmüthige Klage des bescheidenen Wilhch, der inzwischen 
kraft  einiger  amerikanischer  Zeitungen  auf  dem  Anciennitätswege  zum 
,General' avancirt ist, wahrscheinlich durch meine Schuld — als hätte meine 
»Anerkennung'  ihn  in  Gefahr  gebracht  auch  General in partibus  zu  werden, 
und  nicht nur  General,  sondern  Feldherr,  Staatsmann,  ja — Diktator] Freund 
Wilhch  muß  sich  sonderbare Vorstellungen von den brillanten Belohnungen 
gemacht  haben,  die  die  communistische  Partei  in  petto  habe für einen pas 
sablen  Bataillons-  und  Freischaaren-Chef,  der  sich ihr  anschließt. 

5 

10 

In  dem  angeführten  Artikel  sprach  ich  von Wilhch  nur  als  Militair,  weil 
er  nur  als  solcher  das  Publikum  interessiren  konnte,  denn  Staatsmann' ist 
er  ja  erst  seitdem  geworden.  Hätte  ich  die  Malice  gegen  ihn besessen,  von 
der  er  glaubt,  sie  besitze  mich  und  meine  Freunde,  hätte  ich  ein  Interesse 
daran  gehabt,  ein  persönliches  Charakterbild  von  ihm  zu  geben,  was  für  15 
Geschichten  wären  zu  erzählen!  Hätte  ich  mich  selbst  auf  die  nur  heitere 
Seite  beschränkt,  wie  würde  ich  die  Geschichte  mit  dem  Apfelbaum  weg 
gelassen  haben,  unter  dem  heber  zu  sterben  während  Absingung  eines 
Liedes, als den deutschen Boden nochmals zu verlassen, er und seine Besan-
çons einen leiblichen Eid geschworen hatten. Wie hätte ich nicht die Comödie 20 
an  der Grenze erzählt, wo  Freund Willich that, als sollte dies nun in Erfüllung 
gehen;  wo  einige  Biedermänner  zu  mir  kamen,  um  mich  ganz  ernsthaft  zu 
bewegen, den braven Willich von seinem Entschluß abzubringen; wo ||7| end 
lich  Willich  dem  vereinigten  Corps  die  Frage  stellt,  ob  sie  nicht  lieber  auf 
deutschem Boden sterben, als ins Exil zurückgehen wollten, wo nach langem 25 
allgemeinen  Schweigen  ein  einziger  todesverachtender  Besançon  ausrief: 
,Hierbleiben!'  und  wo  zum  Schluß  die  ganze  Gesellschaft  mit großem  Ver 
gnügen  und  mit  Waffen  und  Bagage  nach  der  Schweiz  übertrat.  Welche 
Episode  hätte  nicht die  spätere Geschichte der Bagage  selbst gebildet, heute 
nicht  ohne  Werth,  wo  Willich  selbst die halbe  Welt auffordert, über  seinen  30 
,Charakter'  sich  zu  erklären.  Wer  übrigens  weitere  Details  über  diese  und 
andere  Abenteuer  wünscht,  braucht  sich  nur  an einen  seiner  300  Spartaner 
zu  wenden,  die  damals  kein  Thermopylä  finden  konnten.  Sie  waren  stets 
bereit, hinter dem Rücken des persönlichen Charakters die größten Skandale 
zu erzählen.  Ich habe  Zeugen in Menge. 

35 

Ueber  die  Geschichte  wegen  meiner  ,Courage'  werde  ich kein Wort ver 
lieren.  Ich habe zu meiner damaligen Verwunderung in Baden gefunden, daß 
die  Courage  eine  der  allerordinärsten  Eigenschaften  ist,  nicht  der  Mühe 
werth  davon  zu  reden;  daß  aber  die  bloße  rohe  Courage  nicht  mehr  werth 
ist, als der bloße gute  Wille, und es deßhalb sehr häufig vorkommt, daß jeder  40 
Einzelne ein Held an Courage ist, und das ganze Bataillon doch ausreißt, wie 

514 

Der  Ritter vom  edelmütigen  Bewußtsein 

Ein Mann.  Ein Exempel bietet die Expedition, des Willich'schen Corps nach 
Karlsdorf,  die  in  meiner  Erzählung  der  Reichsverfassungs-Campagne  des 
Breiteren  mitgetheilt  ist. 

Bei  dieser  Gelegenheit,  nämlich  in  der  Neujahrsnacht  1850,  behauptet 
5  Willich mir eine siegreiche moralische Predigt gehalten zu haben. Da ich nicht 
gewohnt bin,  Buch darüber  zu führen,  wie  ich aus  einem  Jahr  in das  andere 
komme,  kann  ich  für  das  Datum  nicht  einstehen.  Die  Predigt,  die  Willich 
abdrucken  läßt,  hat  er  so  nie  gehalten. 

10 

15 

Im  Hüchtlings-Committee,  heißt es, habe  ich mit mehreren Anderen mich 
.unwürdig'  gegen  den großen  Mann benommen.  Shocking!  Aber  wo waren 
die  siegreichen  sittlichen  Argumente  denn  damals,  wenn Willich,  der  Zer 
treter  der  Gottlosen,  sich  plötzlich  machtlos  gegen  bloßes  ,unwürdiges 
Benehmen' fand. Man wird nicht verlangen, daß ich ernsthaft auf dergleichen 
Albernheiten  eingehen  soll. 

In der  Sitzung der Centraibehörde, wo  es zwischen Schramm und Willich 
zur  Forderung  kam,  soll ich  das  Verbrechen begangen haben,  mit Schramm 
kurz  vor der Scene das  ,Zimmer verlassen', also die ganze Scene vorbereitet 
zu  haben. 

Früher  war  es  Marx,  der  Schramm  ,gehetzt'  haben  sollte,  jetzt,  zur  Ab-
20  wechselung  bin  ich  es.  Ein  Duell  zwischen  einem  alten  auf  Pistolen  ein 

geschossenen preußischen Lieutenant und  einem  commerçant, der vielleicht 
nie  eine  Pistole in der Hand gehabt, war wahrlich eine famose  Maßregel, um 
den  Lieutenant  ,aus  dem  Wege  zu  räumen'.  Trotzdem  erzählte  Freund 
Willich  überall,  mündüch  und  schriftlich,  wir  hätten  ihn  erschießen  lassen 

25  wollen. 

30 

Es  ist  wohl  möglich  —  ich  führe  kein  Buch  darüber,  wenn  gewisse  Be 
dürfnisse  mich nöthigen,  das Zimmer zu verlassen, — daß ich mit Schramm 
zugleich das Zimmer verließ; aber es ist nicht wahrscheinlich, da ich aus den 
bei  mir  deponirten  Sitzungsprotokollen  der  damaligen  Centralbehörde  er-
sehe,  daß  Schramm  und  ich  an  jenem  Abend  abwechselnd  das  Protokoll 
führten.  Schramm  war  einfach  wüthend  über  Willich's  schamloses  Auftre 
ten,  und  uns  Allen  zur  größten  Ueberraschung,  zwang  er  ihn  zum  Duell. 
Schramm  selbst  hatte  einige  Minuten  vorher  keine  Ahnung,  daß  es  dazu 
kommen  werde.  Nie  war  eine  Handlung  spontaner.  Willich  erzählt  hier 
35  wieder,  er habe eine  Rede gehalten,  ,Du,  Schramm, verläßt das Zimmer!' In 
der  Wirklichkeit  appellirte  Willich  an  die  Centraibehörde,  Schramm  aus 
zuweisen.  Die  Centraibehörde  ignorirte  sein  Begehren,  und  Schramm  ent 
fernte  sich  nur  auf  persönliches  Zureden  von  Marx,  der  weiteren  Skandal 
vermeiden  wollte.  Auf  meiner  Seite  steht  das  Protokollbuch,  auf  der  des 

40  Herrn  Willich  sein  persönlicher  Charakter. 

Friedrich  Engels." 

515 

Karl Marx 

Herr  Willich  erzählt  weiter,  wie  er  das,  „unwürdige  Benehmen"  des 
Flüchtlings-Kommittee's  im  Arbeiterverein erzählt und  einen Antrag darauf 
begründet hat.  Als, berichtet das edle Bewußtsein,  „als die Entrüstung gegen 
Marx  und  Clique  auf  das  höchste  stieg,  summte ich für  die  Behandlung  der 
Sache  in  der  Centraibehörde.  Dies fand  statt". 

Was 

in  der 
fand  statt?  Willich's  Stimmen  oder  die  Behandlung 
Centraibehörde?  Welche  Großmuth!  Seine  Gebieter  stimme  entreißt  seine 
Feinde  der  auf's  Höchste  gestiegenen  Entrüstung  des  Volks.  Herr  Wilhch 
vergißt  den  Umstand,  daß  die  Centraibehörde  die  geheime  Behörde  einer 
geheimen  Gesellschaft,  der  Arbei||8|terverein  aber  eine  öffentliche  exoteri- 
sehe  Gesellschaft  war.  Er  vergißt,  daß  die  Behandlung  der  Sache  in  der 
Centraibehörde  im  Arbeiterverein  daher  nicht  zum  Stimmen  gebracht 
werden und  so  die  Samariterscene,  als  deren Held er figurirt, nicht vorfallen 
konnte.  Freund  Schapper  wird  ihm  sein  Gedächtniß  erfrischen  helfen. 

5 

10 

Von dem öffentlichen Arbeiterverein führt uns Herr Wilhch in die geheime 
Centraibehörde  und  aus  der  Centraibehörde  nach  Antwerpen  zum  Duell, 
seinem  Duelle  mit  Schramm: 

15 

„Schramm  kam  nach  Ostende  in  Begleitung  eines  ehemaligen  russischen 
Offiziers,  der  in  der  ungarischen  Revolution  nach  seiner  Aussage  zu  den 
Ungarn  übergegangen  war  und  nach  dem  Duell  spurlos  verschwand." 

20 

Dieser  „ehemalige  russische  Offizier"  ist  niemand  anders  als  Heinrich 

Ludwig  Miskowsky. 

„This  is",  heißt  es  in  einem  der  Zeugnisse  des  ehemaligen  russischen 
Offiziers,  „This is to testify, that the bearer Henri Lewis Miskowsky, a Polish 
gentleman,  has  served  during  the  late  Hungarian  war  1848—1849 as  officer 
in the 46th.  bataillon of the  Hungarian  Honveds,  and that he behaved as  such 
praiseworthy  and  gallantly. 
London,  Nov.  12,  1853. 

L. Kossuth,  late  governor  of  Hungary." 

25 

Verlogenes  edelmüthiges  Bewußtsein!  Aber  der  Zweck  ist  ede7.  Der 
Gegensatz  des  Guten  und  Bösen muß im  stechenden Contrast als lebendes  30 
Bild  vorgeführt  werden.  Welch'  künstlerische  Gruppe!  Auf  der  einen  Seite 
der  Edle,  umgeben  „von  Techow,  jetzt  in  Australien,  Vidil, französischem 
Husarenrittmeister,  der  damals  im  Exil,  jetzt  Gefangener  in  Algier,  und 
Barthélémy,  durch  die  französischen  Blätter  als  einer  der  entschiedensten 
Revolutionäre bekannt".  Kurz, Wilhch in eigener Person, umgeben von den  35 
Blüthen zweier  Revolutionen,  auf der einen Seite.  Auf der andern Schramm, 
das  Laster,  verwais't  auf  einen  „ehemaligen  russischen  Offizier",  dessen 
Theilnahme  an der ungarischen Revolution nicht wirklich, sondern nur „nach 
seiner  Aussage"  stattfindet,  und  der  gar  nach  dem  Duell  „spurlos  ver 
schwindet", also am Ende der Teufel selber war. In malerischer Ausführung  40 
steigt die Tugend in  dem  „ersten Hotel"  Ostende's  ab,  wo  ein  „preußischer

ir 

Der  Ritter vom  edelmütigen  Bewußtsein 

Prinz"  logirt,  während  das  Laster  mit  dem  russischen  Offizier  „in  einem 
Privathause  wohnte".  Ganz  scheint  der russische  Offizier  nicht  „nach  dem 
Duelle  verschwunden"  zu  sein,  da  nach Herrn Willich's  fernerer Erzählung 
„Schramm  mit  dem  russischen  Offizier  an  dem  Bach  zurückblieb".  Der 
russische  Offizier  ist  auch  nicht,  wie  der  Edelmuth  hofft,  aus  der  Welt 
verschwunden,  wie  nachstehende  Erklärung  beweis't: 

5 

London,  den  24.  Nov.  1853. 

15 

„Unter  dem  28. Oct.  befindet  sich  ein  Artikel  in  der  Criminalzeitung  von 
Herrn  Willich,  in  welchem  er  unter  andern das  mit  Schramm  in Antwerpen 
10  gehabte Duell 1850 beschreibt. Ich bedaure, daß die Beschreibung desselben 
nicht  in  allen  Punkten  wahrhaft  der  Oeffentlichkeit  übergeben  worden  ist. 
Es heißt: ,es wurde das Duell arrangirt etc. ; Schramm kam in Begleitung eines 
ehemaligen  russischen  Offiziers  etc.,  der  etc.  verschwand'.  Dieses  ist  eine 
Unwahrheit.  Ich  diente  niemals  Rußland,  und  so  wie  ich,  könnten  alle  an-
deren  polnischen  Offiziere  in  Ungarn's  Freiheitskampf  russische  genannt 
werden.  Ich  diente  in  Ungarn  von  Anfang  des  Krieges  von  1848,  bis  1849 
das  Ende  bei  Villagos  erfolgte.  Ich  bin  auch  nicht  spurlos  verschwunden. 
Nachdem  Schramm's  Schuß  fehlte,  den  er  aus  dem  Lager  mit 
ll2  Schritt 
Position auf Willich abschoß,  Willich auf Schramm von  seinem Standpunkte 
20  aus  feuerte  und  seine  Kugel Schramm's  Kopf unbedeutend verletzte, blieb 
ich  bei  Schramm  zurück,  weil  wir keinen  Doktor hatten  (Herr  Willich  hatte 
das  Duell  arrangirt),  wusch  ihm  seine  Wunde  und  verband  dieselbe  ohne 
Rücksicht  auf  sieben Menschen,  die in unserer Nähe Heu machten, das Duell 
mit  ansahen  und  für  mich  gefährlich  werden  konnten.  Willich  und  seine 
25  genannten Begleiter  entfernten  sich eiligst vom Platze, und Schramm sowie 
ich  blieben  ruhig  stehen,  denselben  nachsehend.  Bald  waren  sie  aus  den 
Augen.  Noch  muß  ich  bemerken,  daß  Willich  mit  seinen Begleitern bereits 
auf  dem  Kampfplatz  war,  als  wir  daselbst  ankamen,  daß  sie  die  Mensur 
abgesteckt hatten,  in welcher Willich  seine  Stellung  so  eingenommen hatte, 
30 daß er im Dunkeln stand. Ich machte Schramm darauf aufmerksam, er sagte : 
Laß  es  gehen.  Schramm  war  muthig,  unerschrocken  und ganz gleichgültig. 
Daß  ich  gezwungen  in  Belgien  zurückblieb,  ist  den  betreffenden  Personen 
nicht unbekannt geblieben.  Auf die weitern Umstände  dieses in  seiner Form 
so  eigenthümlichen  Duells  will  ich  nicht  weiter  eingehen.

Karl Marx 

|9|  „Andern  Morgens  früh  (nach  Hrn. Willich's  Eintreffen  in  Ostende) 
zeigte  er  (ein  befreundeter  französischer  Bürger)  uns  den  Précurseur  de 
Bruxelles,  in  welchem  Blatte  sich eine  Privat-Correspondenz mit folgender 
,Mehrere  deutsche  Flüchtlinge  sind  in  Brighton  angekommen. 
Stelle  fand: 
Man  schreibt  uns  aus  dieser  Stadt:  Ledru  Rollin  und  die  französischen 
Flüchtlinge  aus  London  werden  in  diesen Tagen  einen  Congreß  in  Ostende 
mit  den  belgischen Demokraten abhalten.' Wer kann auf die  Ehre  Anspruch 
machen,  diese  Idee  seine  eigene  zu  nennen?  Von  einem  Franzosen war  sie 
nicht, dafür war sie zu apropos. Diese Ehre bleibt ungeschmälert Hrn. Marx; 
denn  wenn  es  auch  einer  seiner  Freunde besorgt haben  mag—  der  Kopf  ist 
der  Ideenfinder,  nicht  die  Hand." 

5 

10 

„Ein  befreundeter  französischer  Bürger"  zeigt  Herrn Wilhch  und  Comp, 
den  Précurseur  de  Bruxelles.  Er  zeigt ihnen,  was  nicht existirt.  Ein Précur 
seur  d'Anvers  existirt  allerdings.  Das  systematische  Verfälschen  und  Um-
lügen der Topographie und Chronologie bildet eine wesentliche Funktion des 15 
edelmüthigen  Bewußtseins.  Ideale  Zeit  und  idealer  Raum  sind  der  ent 
sprechende  Rahmen  seiner  idealen  Erzeugnisse. 

Um  zu  beweisen,  daß  diese  Idee,  nämlich  der  Artikel in dem Précurseur 
de  Bruxelles,  „von"  Marx  „war",  versichert  Hr. Wilhch:  „von einem Fran 
zosen war sie nicht". Diese Idee  warnicht  von!  „Dafür war sie zu à propos." 
Mon dieu, eine Idee, die Hr. Wilhch selbst nur französisch ausdrücken kann, 
sollte  nicht  von  einem  Franzosen  sein?  Aber  wie  kommt  der  Franzose 
überhaupt hereingeschneit, edelmüthiges Bewußtsein? Was hat der Franzose 
zu  thun  mit  Willich  und  Schramm  und  dem  ehemaligen  russischen  Offizier 
und  dem Précurseur  de Bruxelles? 

20 

25 

Der  Gedankensprecher  des  edelmüthigen Bewußtseins  wird  unzeitig laut 
und  verräth,  daß  es  à  propos  findet,  ein  nothwendiges  Zwischenglied weg-
zueskamotiren.  Flicken wir  das  Glied  wieder  an. 

Bevor Schramm  Hrn. Willich  zum  Duell  provozirt  hatte,  hatte  der  Fran 

zose  Barthélémy  ein Duell  mit  dem  Franzosen  Songeon verabredet, das in  30 
Belgien  stattfinden  sollte.  Barthélémy  erkor  sich  Willich  und  Vidil  zu  Se 
kundanten.  Songeon war nach Belgien abgereis't.  Der Incident mit Schramm 
kam  dazwischen.  Beide  Duelle  sollten  nun  an  einem  Tage  stattfinden. 
Songeon  stellte  sich  nicht.  Barthélémy,  bei  seiner  Rückkehr nach  London, 
behauptete  öffentlich:  Songeon  habe  den  Artikel  im  Précurseur  d'Anvers 
veranlaßt. 

35 

Lange  schwankte  das  edelmüthige  Bewußtsein,  bis  es  die  Idee  von  Bar 
thélémy  auf  sich  und  von  Songeon  auf  mich  übertrug.  Ursprünglich,  wie 
Techow  selbst nach  seiner Rückkunft nach London mir und Engels erzählte, 
war  es  fest überzeugt,  daß  ich  durch  Schramm's  Vermittlung  das  Edle  aus  40 
der  Welt  zu  schaffen  beabsichtigte,  und  es  schrieb  diese  Idee  in  alle  Welt. 

518 

Der  Ritter vom  edelmütigen  Bewußtsein 

Bei  näherem  Nachdenken  fand  es  indeß,  daß  ein  diabolischer  Taktiker 
unmöglich  auf  den  Einfall  kommen  konnte,  Herrn  Willich  durch  ein  Duell 
mit  Schramm  zu  beseitigen.  Also  griff  es  nach  der  Idee,  „die  von  einem 
Franzosen  war". 

5 

These:  „Diese  Ehre  bleibt  ungeschmälert  Herrn  Marx."  Beweis:  „Denn 
wenn  es  (die  Idee  ist  natürlich  dem  Sittenreinen  nicht  weiblich,  sondern 
geschlechtslos)  auch  einer  seiner  Freunde  besorgt  haben  mag  (eine  Idee 
besorgen)  —  der  Kopf  ist  der  Ideenfinder,  nicht  die  Hand."  Denn  wenn! 
Großes  denn  wenn .'Um zu beweisen, daß Marx „es"  erfunden hat, unterstellt 

10  Hr. Wülich,  daß  ein  Freund  von Marx  „es"  besorgt hat,  oder  vielmehr be 

sorgt  haben  mag.  Quod  erat  demonstrandum. 

„Wenn",  sagt  das  edelmüthige  Bewußtsein,  „wenn  es  feststeht,  daß 
Szemere,  der  Freund  von  Marx,  die  Krone  Ungarns  an  die  östreichische 
Regierung  verrathen,  so  würde  das  ein  treffender  Beleg  etc.  sein." 

15 

Es  steht nun  zwar  das  Gegentheü fest.  Doch das gehört nicht zur  Sache. 
Wenn Szemere  einen Verrath begangen hätte,  so  würde das für Herrn Wülich 
ein „treffender" Beleg sein, daß Marx den Artikel im Précurseur de BruxeUes 
besorgt  hat.  Wenn  aber  auch  der  Vordersatz  nicht feststeht,  so  steht  doch 
der  Nachsatz  fest,  und ||10| es  steht  fest,  daß  wenn  Szemere  die  Krone  des

Nachdem  der  russische  Offizier  spurlos  verschwunden 

20  heiligen  Stephan,  Marx  den  heiligen  Stephan  selbst verrathen hat. 
ist, 

taucht 
Hr. Willich  wieder  auf;  und  zwar  im  „Arbeiterverein  in  London",  wo  „die 
Arbeiter  Herrn  Marx  einstimmig  verurtheüten"  und  „am  Tage  nach  dem 
Austritt  aus  dem Verein in einer Generalversammlung des Londoner Kreises 
einstimmig  aus  dem  Bund  ausschlossen".  Vorher aber  „faßte  Marx mit der 
Majorität  der  Centraibehörde  den  Entschluß,  dieselbe  von  London  zu ver 
legen",  und  trotz  Schappers  wohlgemeinten  Remonstrationen  einen  Kreis 
für  sich  zu  büden.  Nach  den  Statuten  der  geheimen  GeseUschaft  hatte  die 
Majorität  das  Recht,  die  Centraibehörde  nach  Köln  zu  verlegen  und  pro-
30  visorisch den ganzen Wülich'sehen Kreis auszuschließen, der ihr gegenüber 
beschlußunfähig^/ar.  Auffallend  bleibt,  daß  das  edelmüthige  Bewußtsein mit 
seiner Vorhebe für kleine dramatische Scenen, worin Herr Wülich eine große 
rhetorische  Rone  spielt,  diesmal  die  Katastrophe  selbst,  die  Scheidungs-
scene,  unbenutzt  vorübergehen  läßt.  Die  Versuchung war groß,  aber leider 
35  existirt  das  trockene  Protokoll  und  weis't  nach,  daß  der  triumphirende 
Christus  stundenlang  den  Anklagen  der  Bösen  stumm  und verlegen gegen 
über  saß,  dann  plötzlich  ausriß,  Freund  Schapper  im  Stiche  ließ  und  die 
Sprache  erst wieder  fand im  „Kreise"  der  Gläubigen.  En passant.  Während 
Herr  W.  in  Amerika die  Herrlichkeiten  des  „durch Achtung und  Vertrauen 
40  mit ihm verbundenen Arbeitervereins" verkündet, hat selbst Herr Schapper 
es  für  nöthig  erachtet,  vorläufig  aus  dem  Verein  des  Herrn Wülich  zurück 
zutreten.

Das  edelmüthige Bewußtsein erhebt sich für einen Moment aus der Sphäre 
des ihm eigentümlichen „taktischen"  Prozesses zur Theorie. Indeß nur zum 
Schein.  In  der  That fährt es  fort,  „Proben von der  Taktik des  Herrn Marx" 
zu  geben.  Pag. 8  der  Enthüllungen  heißt  es:  „Die  Partei  Schapper-Wülich 
(Hr. Wülich citirt Willich-Schapper) hat nie auf die Ehre Anspruch gemacht, 
eigne Ideen zu besitzen.  Was ihr gehört, ist das eigenthümliche Mißverständ-
niß  fremder  Ideen."  Um  dem  Publikum  seinen  Vorrath  an  eignen Ideen  zu 
beweisen,  theüt  Hr. W.  als  seine neueste Entdeckung  mit und zwar  als  eine 
Widerlegung  der  Ansichten  von Engels  und  mir,  „welche  Institutionen"  das 
Kleinbürgerthum,  käme  es  zur  Herrschaft,  „treffen"  würde.  In  einem  von  10 
Engels  und  mir  verfaßten  Rundschreiben,  das  die  sächsische  Polizei  bei 
Bürgers  abfaßte,  das  in  den  gelesensten  deutschen  Zeitungen  erschien und 
die  Grundlage  des  Kölner  Anklageakts  büdet,  befindet  sich  eine  längere 
Ausführung  über  die  frommen  Wünsche  des  deutschen  Kleinbürgerthums. 
Dies  der  Text  der Wülich'sehen Predigt.  Der Leser vergleiche  Original und  15 
Copie.  Wie  human  von  der  Tugend,  das  Laster  abzuschreiben,  wenn  auch 
mit  dem  „eigenthümlichen Mißverständniß".  Für  den verschlechterten  Styl 
entschädigt  die  verbesserte  Gesinnung. 

Pag. 64  der  Enthüllungen  heißt  es,  daß  der  Bund  der  Communisten  in 
meiner  Ansicht  „die Büdung nicht der  Regierungs- sondern der  Oppositions- 
partei  der Zukunft bezweckt".  Hr. Wülich  ist  edel,  den  vordem Theü  „nicht 
der  Regierungs-"  wegzuschwindeln,  um  sich  an  das  Hintertheü der Opposi 
tionspartei  der  Zukunft festzuklammern.  Aus  dieser  sinnigen Halbirung des 
Satzes  beweis't  er,  daß  die  Partei  der  Stellenjäger  die  wahre  Partei  der 
Revolution ist. 

20 

25 

Die  sonstige  „eigene"  Idee,  die  Herr Wülich produzirt, besteht darin, daß 
der  praktische  Gegensatz  zwischen  dem  edelmüthigen  Bewußtsein  und 
seinen  Gegnern  auch 
theoretisch  ausgedrückt  werden  kann  als  „eine 
Scheidung  der  Menschheit  in  zwei  Gattungen",  die  Willichs  und  die  Anti-
Wülichs,  die  Gattung  der  Edlen  und  die  Gattung  der  Unedlen.  Von  der  30 
Gattung  der  Edlen  erfahren  wir,  daß  ihr  Hauptkennzeichen  darin  besteht, 
„daß  sie  sich  anerkennen".  Langweüig  sein  ist  das  Privüegjum  des  edelmü 
thigen  Bewußtseins,  wo  es  aufhört,  durch  Proben  von  der  Taktik  zu  kurz-
weüen. 

Wir haben gesehen, wie das edelmüthige Bewußtsein Thatsachen umlügt,  35 

oder zurechtlügt oder lächerlichen Hypothesen den Rang von ernsten Thesen 
anweis't,  —  Alles  um  den  Gegensatz  gegen  es  selbst  thatsächlich  als  das 
Unedle,  das  Niederträchtige  zu  konstatiren.  Wir  haben gesehen,  wie  daher 
seine  ganze  Thätigkeit ||l l| ausschließlich  in  der  Erfindung des Niederträch 
tigen besteht. Die umgekehrte Seite dieser Thätigkeit ist, daß es die thatsäch-  40 
liehen  Verwickelungen,  worin es  selbst mit der Welt geräth, mögen sie noch

so  compromittirend  erscheinen, 
in  thatsächliche  Beweise  des  eignen 
Edelmuths  verwandelt.  Dem  Reinen ist Alles  rein,  und  der Gegner,  der  den 
Edelmuth  an seinen Thaten mißt, beweis't eben dadurch, daß er der Unreine 
ist.  Das  edelmüthige  Bewußtsein  hat  sich  daher  nicht  zu  rechtfertigen, 
sondern nur  seine  sittliche  Entrüstung und  sein  Erstaunen über  den Gegner 
kundzugeben,  der  es  zur  Rechtfertigung  zwingt.  Die  Episode  daher,  worin 
Herr  Wilhch  sich  zu  rechtfertigen  vorgiebt,  hätte  ebensogut  ganz  wegfallen 
können,  wie  Jeder  sich überzeugen wird,  der meine Enthüllungen,  Hirsch's 
Selbst-Bekenntnisse und Herrn Willich's Antwort vergleicht.  Ich hebe daher 
nur  an  einigen  Beispielen  die  Männer des  edelmüthigen  Bewußtseins  her 
vor. 

Herr  Willich war weniger kompromittirt durch meine  „Enthüllungen", als 
durch  Hirsch's  Selbstbekenntnisse,  obgleich  sie  ursprünglich  bestimmt 
waren,  ihn  als  den Erlöser der eignen Feinde zu verherrlichen.  Er vermeidet 
es  daher  sorgfältig,  auf  Hirsch's  Selbstbekenntnisse  einzugehen.  Er  ver 
meidet  sie  auch  nur  zu  erwähnen.  Hirsch  ist  das  notorische  Werkzeug  der 
preußischen Polizei gegen die  Partei,  der ich angehöre.  Der Thatsache steht 
Herr  Willich  die  Vermuthung  gegenüber,  daß  Hirsch  eigentlich  von  mir 
bestimmt  war,  die  Partei  Wilhch  zu  „sprengen". 

„Sehr  bald  intriguirte  er  (Hirsch)  mit  einigen  Anhängern  von Marx,  na 
mentlich  einem  gewissen  Lochner,  um  den  Verein  zu  sprengen.  In  Folge 
dessen  wurde  er  beobachtet.  Er  wurde  ertappt  etc.  Er  wurde  auf  meinen 
Antrag  ausgestoßen;  Lochner  trat  für  ihn  auf  und  wurde  ebenfalls  aus 
Hirsch intriguhte nun namentlich gegen O. D i e t z . .. die Intrigue 
gestoßen 

25  wurde  augenblicklich  wieder  aufgedeckt." 

Daß Hirsch auf Antrag des Herrn Willich als Spion aus dem Arbeiterverein 
der  Great  Windmill  Street  ausgestoßen  wurde,  berichte  ich  selbst  in  den 
„Enthüllungen" pag. 67. Diese Ausstoßung war ohne alles Gewicht für mich, 
da  ich  erfuhr,  was  Herr  Wilhch  jetzt  selbst  bestätigt,  daß  sie  nicht  auf  den 
30  Grund  erwiesener  Thatsachen  erfolgte,  sondern  auf  den  Verdacht  ein 
gebildeter  Intriguen  Hirsch's  mit  mir.  Von  diesem  Verbrechen  wußte  ich 
Hirsch  frei.  Was  Lochner  betrifft,  so  verlangte  er  Beweise  für  Hirsch's 
Schuld.  Herr  Wilhch antwortete, daß Hirsch's  Subsistenzquellen unbekannt 
seien.  Und  die  Subsistenzquellen des  Herrn Wilhch? fragte Lochner. Wegen 
dieser  „unwürdigen"  Aeußerung  ward  LochneF  vor  ein  Ehrengericht citirt, 
und  da  er  die  Sünde  trotz  allen geistlichen  Zuspruch's  nicht bereuen wollte, 
„ausgestoßen".  Nachdem Hirsch ausgestoßen, nachdem  Lochner ihm nach 
gesandt  war,  intriguht  Hirsch  „nun  namentlich  gegen  O. Dietz  mit  einem 
sehr  verdächtigen  ehemaligen  Polizeidiener,  der  Dietz  bei  uns  denun-

35 

40  zirte". 

Stechan,  einem  hannover'schen  Gefängnisse  entsprungen,  kam  nach 

521 

Karl Marx 

London,  trat  in  den  Willich'schen  Arbeiterverein  und  denunzirte  den 
O.Dietz.  Stechan  war  weder  „verdächtig",  noch  „ehemaliger  sächsischer 
Polizeidiener".  Was  ihn  zur  Denunziation  des  O. Dietz  bestimmte,  war  der 
Umstand,  daß  der  Instruktionsrichter  ihm  mehrere  seiner  an  Dietz,  den 
Sekretär  des  Willich'schen  Committees,  nach  London  gerichteten  Briefe in 
Hannover  vorzeigte.  Ungefähr  gleichzeitig  mit  Stechan  hatte  Lochner  sich 
eingefunden,  Eccarius II,  eben aus  der Gefängnißhaft in Hannover entlassen 
und  ausgewiesen,  Gümpel,  wegen  seiner  Betheiligung  an  den  Schleswig-
Holstein'schen  Angelegenheiten  steckbrieflich  verfolgt,  und  Hirsch,  der 
1848  wegen  eines  revolutionären  Gedichts  in  Hamburg  gesessen  hatte  und 
sich  für  abermals  verfolgt  ausgab.  Sie  bildeten  mit  Stechan zusammen eine 
Art  Opposition  und  begingen die  Sünde  gegen den heiligen Geist,  die  Glau 
benslehre  des  Herrn  Wülich  in  den  öffentüchen  Diskussionen  des  Vereins 
zu  bekämpfen.  Ihnen  allen fiel auf, daß Stechan's Denunziation gegen Dietz 
mit  der  Ausstoßung  Hirsch's  durch  Wülich beantwortet  wurde.  Bald  waren 
sie  sämmtlich aus dem Arbeiterverein ausgetreten und büdeten eine Zeitlang 
mit  Stechan  einen  Verein für  sich.  Mit  mir  traten sie erst in Berührung nach 
ihrem  Austritt  aus  dem  Vereine  des  Herrn  Wülich.  Das  edel||l2|müthige 
Bewußtsein  verräth  seine  Lüge  durch  die  Verkehrung  der  Zeitverhältnisse 
und  das  Weglassen  Stechan's,  des  nothwendigen,  aber  lästigen Mittelglie 
des. 

Ich  sage  pag.66  der  Enthüllungen:  „Nicht  lange  vor  den  Kölner Assisen 
verhandlungen  schickten  Kinkel  und  Wülich  einen  SchneidergeseUen  als 
Emissair nach Deutschland etc." „Warum" ruft das edelmüthige Bewußtsein 
entrüstet  aus,  „warum  hebt  Herr  Marx  den  Schneidergesellen  hervor?"  Ich 
hebe  den  SchneidergeseUen  nicht  „hervor",  wie  z.B.  der  Edle  bei  Pieper 
„den  Privatlehrer  bei  Rothschüd"  hervorhebt,  obgleich  Pieper  seine  Stelle 
bei Rothschüd  in  Folge  des  Kölner  Communistenprozesses  verlor und  statt 
dessen  die  Mitredaktion  am  Organ  der  englischen  Chartisten gewann.  Ich 
nenne  den  SchneidergeseUen  einen  SchneidergeseUen.  Warum?  Weü  ich 
seinen  Namen  verschweigen  und  doch  Herrn  Kinkel-Wülich  beweisen 
mußte,  daß  ich genau mit  den Personalien  ihres  Emissairs bekannt war. Der 
Edelmuth  bezüchtigt  mich  daher  eines  Hochverraths  an  sämmtlichen 
SchneidergeseUen  und  sucht  ihre  Stimmen  durch  eine  pindarische  Ode  auf 
die  SchneidergeseUen  zu  sichern.  Aus  Schonung  für  den  guten  Ruf  der 
SchneidergeseUen verschweigt er großmüthig, daß Eccarius, den er als einen 
der  ausgestoßenen  Böcke  bezeichnet,  ein  SchneidergeseUe  ist,  was  den 
Eccarius  bisher  nicht  daran  verhindert  hat,  einer  der  größten  Denker  des 
deutschen  Proletariats  zu  sein  und  durch  seine  englischen  Artikel  im  Red 
Republican,  in  den  Notes  to  the  People  und  in  den  People's  Paper  sich  eine 
Autorität  unter  den  Chartisten  selbst zu  erobern.  In  dieser  Weise  widerlegt 

522 

Der  Ritter vom  edelmütigen  Bewußtsein 

Herr Willich meine  Enthüllungen über die Thätigkeit des von ihm und Kinkel 
nach  Deutschland  gesandten  Schneidergesellen. 

Nun  zum  Casus  Herne.  Das  edelmüthige  Bewußtsein  sucht  durch  einen 
Ausfall  auf  mich  seine  eigene  Position  zu  decken.  „Unter  andern  hat  er 

5 

(Henze)  Marx  300Rth.  geborgt. " 
Im Mai 1849 setzte ich Herrn Rempel die f inanziellen Schwierigkeiten der 
Neuen  Rheinischen  Zeitung  auseinander,  die  mit  der  Zunahme  der  Abon 
nentenzahl  zunahmen,  da  die  Auslagen  baar,  die  Einnahmen  aber  nur 
nachträglich  zu  erheben  waren,  und  zudem  bedeutende  Ausfälle  veranlaßt 
10  wurden durch die Desertion fast sämmtlicher Aktionäre in Folge der Artikel 
für  die  Pariser  Junünsurgenten  und  gegen  die  Frankfurter  Parlamentler,  die 
Berliner  Vereinbarer  und  die  Märzvereinler.  Herr  Rempel  wieß  mich  an 
Henze, und Herr Henze  schoß der Neuen Rheinischen Zeitung, gegen meine 
schriftliche  Obligation,  300 Thaler vor.  Henze, damals  selbst von der Polizei 
15  verfolgt,  fand es  nöthig,  Hamm zu verlassen und reis'te mit nur nach Köln, 
wo  mich die  Nachricht  von meiner Expulsion aus Preußen empfing.  Die 300 
nur von Henze geborgten Thaler,  1500 Thaler Abonnentengelder, die ich von 
der  preußischen  Post  erhielt,  die  mir  gehörige  Schnellpresse  etc.  wurden 
sämmtlich zur Liquidation  der  Schulden  der  Neuen Rheinischen Zeitung an 
20  Setzer,  Drucker,  Papierhändler,  Comptoiristen,  Correspondenten,  Redak 
tionspersonal etc.  verwandt.  Niemand weiß  dieß besser,  als Herr Henze, da 
er  selbst  meiner  Frau  eine  Reisetasche borgte, um  ihr  Silber  zu verpacken, 
nach  Frankfurt  in's  Pfandhaus  zu  bringen,  und  so  die  Mittel  für  unsere 
Privatbedürfnisse  zu  beschaffen.  Die  Rechnungsbücher  der  Neuen  Rhei-
25  nischen  Zeitung  hegen  zu  Köln  bei  dem  Kaufmann  Stephan  Naut,  und ich 
ermächtige  das  edelmüthige  Bewußtsein,  sich dort einen  amtlich beglaubig 
ten  Auszug  ausfertigen  zu  lassen. 

Nach  dieser  Abschweifung  zur  Sache. 
Die  Enthüllungen finden es  keineswegs  unklar,  daß  Herr Wilhch Henze's 
30  Freund  war  und  Unterstützungen  von  ihm  empfing.  Sie  finden  es  unklar 
(pag. 65.), daß Henze, bei dem selbst eine Haussuchung stattfand und Papiere 
saisirt wurden, der überwiesen war, den Schimmelpf ennig in Berlin auf einer 
geheimen  Mission beherbergt  zu  haben, und der Mitwissenschaft am  Bunde 
„geständig"  war,  daß  dieser  Henze  während  der  Epoche,  wo  der  Kölner 
35  Prozeß  zur  Entscheidung drängte, wo  die  Aufmerksamkeit der preußischen 
Polizei  auf's  höchste  gespannt,  und  jeder  halbverdächtige  Deutsche  in 
Deutschland  und  in  England  auf's  strengste  überwacht  war,  die  obrigkeit 
liche  Erlaubniß  erhielt,  nach  London  zu  reisen  und  dort  ungenirt 
mit I| l 3| Willich  zu  verkehren,  dann  aber  in  Köln  eintraf,  um  gegen Becker 
„falsche  Aussagen"  zu  machen.  Die  bestimmte  Zeitepoche giebt dem Ver-
hältniß  des  Herrn  Henze  und  Willich  den  bestimmten  Charakter,  und  die 

40 

523 

Karl Marx 

erwähnten  Umstände  mußten  Herrn  Willich  selbst  befremden,  obwohl  er 
nicht  wußte,  daß  Henze  von  London  aus  mit  der  preußischen  Polizei  tele-
graphirte.  Es  handelt  sich  um  die  Zeitepoche.  Hr. Willich  fühlt  dies  richtig 
heraus und erklärt daher in seiner edlen Art:  „er{Henze) kam vor dem Prozeß 
nach  London"  (dies  behaupte  ich  auch);  „nicht  zu  mir,  sondern  zur  Indu- 
strieausstellung."  Das  edelmüthige  Bewußtsein  hat  seine  eigene  Industrie 
ausstellung,  wie  seinen  eigenen  Précurseur  de  Bruxelles.  Die  wirkliche 
Londoner  Industrieausstellung  wurde  Oktober  1851  geschlossen;  Herr 
Willich  läßt  den  Henze  im  August  1852  „zu  ihr"  reisen.  Diesen  Umstand 
können  Schily,  Heise  und  die  übrigen  Garanten  der  Kinkel-Wülich'schen  10 
Anleihe  bezeugen,  denen Herr Henze einzeln  seine Aufwartung machte, um 
ihre  Stimmen für die  Uebersiedlung der  amerikanischen Gelder  von London 
nach  Berlin  zu  gewinnen. 

5 

Als Herr Henze bei Herrn Willich verweilte, war er längst als  Zeuge, nicht 
von  der  Vertheidigung,  sondern  von  der  Anklage,  zu den Kölner Gerichts-  15 
Verhandlungen  vorgeladen.  Sobald wir  erfuhren,  Herr Willich habe  Henze 
instruirt,  vor  den  Kölner  Assisen  gegen  Becker,  „den  Mann von  Geist und 
Charakter"  auszusagen  (pag.68  der  Enthüllungen),  wurde  sofort  an  Ad 
vokaten  Schneider  II,  Becker's  Vertheidiger  die  nöthige  Mittheüung  ge 
macht;  der  Brief  traf  ein  am  Tage  des  Zeugenverhörs  von  Henze,  die  Art  20 
seiner  Aussage  stimmte  mit unsrer  Vorhersage,  Becker und  Schneider inter-
pellirten ihn daher öffentlich über sein Verhältniß zu Herrn Willich. Der Brief 
befindet  sich  in  den Vertheidigungsakten zu  Köln,  der Bericht über Henze's 
Verhör  in  der  Kölnischen  Zeitung. 

Ich raisonire nicht: „ Wenn es feststeht, daß Herr Henze das und das gethan  25 

hat,  so  würde das ein schlagender Beweis für die Thätigkeit des Herrn Willich 
sein;  denn  wenn  es  auch  Freund  Henze  besorgt  haben  mag  —  der  Kopf ist 
der  Ideenfinder,  nicht  die  Hand."  Diese  Dialektik  überlasse  ich  dem 
edelmüthigen  Bewußtsein. 

Kehren wir zum eigentlichen Gebiet des Herrn Willich zurück: „zur vollen 30 

Würdigung  der  (von  Marx  befolgten)  Taktik  noch  einige  Proben". 

Zur  Zeit  des  passiven  Widerstandes  in  Hessen,  des  Landwehraufgebots 
in Preußen, und  des  simulirten Conflikts  zwischen Preußen und Oesterreich, 
stand  das  edelmüthige  Bewußtsein  grade  auf  dem  Sprung,  eine  Mi 
litärinsurrektion  in  Deutschland  zu  vollbringen,  und  zwar  durch  Sendung  35 
eines  „kurzen  Entwurfs  zur  Bildung  von  Landwehrausschüssen  an  einige 
Personen  in  Preußen"  und  durch  den  Willen  des  Herrn Wülich „selbst  nach 
Preußen zu gehen" . .. „Herr Marx, benachrichtigt von einem der Seinen war 
es,  der  meine  beabsichtigte  Abreise  weiter  wissen  ließ  und  später  sich 
rühmte,  mich  mit  falschen  Briefen  aus  Deutschland  mystif  izirt  zu  haben."  40 
Indeed!  Becker  schickte  mir  mit  drolligen  Randglossen  die  tollen  Briefe 

524 

Der  Ritter vom  edelmütigen  Bewußtsein 

Willich's, die er in Köln öffentlich zum Besten gab. Ich war nicht so grausam, 
meinen  Freunden  den  Genuß  dieser  Lektüre  vorzuenthalten.  Schramm  und 
Pieper  ergötzten  sich  daran,  Herrn  Wilhch  mit  Antworten,  nicht  „aus 
Deutschland",  sondern  vermittelst  der  Londoner  Stadtpost  zu  mystif  iziren. 
5  Der  Edle  wird  sich  hüten,  die  Poststempel  der  Briefe  zu  produziren.  Er 
behauptet,  „einen  Brief  mit  nachgemachter  Handschrift  erhalten  und  als 
falsch erkannt zu haben".  Unmöglich. Diese Briefe waren alle von derselben 
Hand  geschrieben.  Während  Herr  Wilhch  sich  daher  „rühmt",  eine  nicht 
existirende  nachgemachte  Handschrift entdeckt und unter einer Anzahl von 
10  Briefen, von denen der eine in seiner Weise so echt war wie der andere, einen 
als  falsch  erkannt zu  haben,  war  er  viel  zu  edelmüthig,  die  Mystifikation zu 
erkennen, aus der in asiatischen Hyperbolen gehaltnen Verherrhchung seiner 
eignen  Person,  aus  dem  grobkomischen  Eingehen in  seine  fixen Ideen,  und 
aus  der  romantischen  Uebertreibung  seiner  eignen  Anmaßungen.  Wäre 
15  Herrn Willich's Abreise  auch ernst gemeint gewesen, so wurde sie vereitelt, 
nicht  durch  mein  „Weiter  wissen ||14| lassen  an  dritte  Personen",  sondern 
durch  das  Wissen  lassen  an  Herrn  Willich  selbst.  Der  letzte  Brief,  den  er 
erhielt,  warf  nämlich  den  ohnehin  durchsichtigen  Schleier  weg.  Seine  Ei 
telkeit  zwingt  ihn  bis  auf  diesen Augenblick,  den  Brief  der  ihn  enttäuschte, 
für  falsch und  die  Briefe,  die  ihn  narrten,  für  echt  zu  erklären.  Glaubt  das 
edelmüthige  Bewußtsein, weil es  tugendhaft sei, solle es wohl sect and cakes, 
aber  keinen Humor  mehr in  der  Welt geben?  Es war unedel von dem Edlen, 
das  Publikum  von  dem  Genuß  dieser  Briefe  auszuschließen. 

20 

„Was  die  von  Marx  angegebene  Correspondenz  mit Becker anbetrifft,  so 

25 

ist  das  darüber  gesagte  falsch." 

Was  diese  falsche  Correspondenz  anbetrifft und  Herrn Willich's  Absicht, 
in  eigner  Person  nach  Preußen  zu  reisen,  und  mein  Weiter  wissen lassen  an 
dritte Personen,  so  fand  ich es  angemessen,  eine  Copie  der Criminalzeitung 
an den ehemaligen Lieutenant Steffen zu schicken.  Steffen war Schutzzeuge 
30  Beckers,  der  ihm  seine  sämmtlichen Papiere  zur Aufbewahrung anvertraut 
hat.  Durch  die  Polizei  gezwungen,  Köln  zu  verlassen,  hält  er  sich  jetzt  in 
Chester  als  Lehrer  auf, da er zur unedlen Gattung von Menschen gehört, die 
ihr  Leben  verdienen  müssen,  selbst  im  Exil.  Das  edelmüthige  Bewußtsein, 
seinem  aetherischen Wesen gemäß,  lebt nicht von dem Kapital, das es nicht 
35  besitzt; auch nicht von der Arbeit, die es nicht thut; es lebt—von dem Manna 
der  öffentlichen  Meinung,  von  der, Achtung  der  Anderen.  Es  streitet  daher 
um  sie,  als  sein  einziges  Kapital. 

Steffen  schreibt  mir:

als  vorgeschützt.  Dieser  plumpen  Behauptung  stelle  ich  Thatsachen  ent 
gegen, um Beckers Ansicht über Willich zu dokumentiren. Eines Abends gab 
mir  Becker  mit  herzlichem  Lachen  zwei  Briefe  und  bat  mich,  dieselben 
durchzulesen, wenn ich übler Laune  sei;  der  Inhalt würde mich um so mehr 
erheitern, als ich durch meine früheren Verhältnisse im Stande sei, denselben 
vom mihtairischen Standpunkt zu beurtheilen.  In der That, beim Durchlesen 
dieser  Briefe,  von  August  Wilhch  an  Becker  gerichtet,  fand  ich  höchst 
komische  und  merkwürdige  Parolebefehle  (um  mich  eines  passenden  kö 
niglich  preußischen  Ausdrucks  zu  bedienen),  in  welchen  der  große  Feld 
marschall und  sociale  Messias  von  England  aus  den  Befehl  giebt,  Köln  zu  10 
nehmen,  das  Privatvermögen  zu  konfischen,  eine  künstlich  konstruirte 
militärische  Dictatur  zu  etabliren,  einen  militärisch-socialen  Codex  ein 
zuführen,  alle  Zeitungen bis  auf  eine zu  verbieten,  welche  die  Befehle  über 
die  vorschriftsmäßige  Denk-  und  Handlungsweise  täglich  zu  bringen habe, 
und  eine  Menge Details mehr.  Wilhch war gütig genug zu versprechen,  daß  15 
wenn  in  Köln  und  der  preußischen  Rheinprovinz  das  Stück  Arbeit  gethan 
sei,  er  selbst  kommen  werde,  zu  sondern  die  Böcke  von  den  Schafen  und 
zu richten die  Lebendigen und  die Todten. Wilhch giebt an, daß sein ,kurzer 
Entwurf leicht  ausführbar gewesen wäre,  wenn einige Personen die Initiative 
ergriffen  hätten'  und  ,daß  er  die  bedeutendsten  Folgen  (für  wen?)  gehabt  20 
haben  würde'.  Ich  möchte  zu  meiner  Belehrung  wohl  wissen,  welche  tief 
sinnigen  ,Landwehroffiziere'  Herrn  Willich  das  ,später  erklärten',  und  ob 
diese  Herren,  die  an  ,die  bedeutendsten  Folgen  des  kurzen  Entwurfs'  zu 
glauben  vorschützten,  sich während  der  Zusammenziehung  der  preußischen 
Landwehr  in  England  aufhielten  oder  in  Preußen,  wo  das  Kind  der  Welt  25 
produzirt werden  sollte?  Es  ist  sehr  hübsch von Willich gewesen, daß er die 
Geburtsanzeige  und  die  Beschreibung  des  Kindes 
,einigen'  Personen 
zugeschickt hat.  Keine dieser Personen  scheint jedoch mehr Neigung gehabt 
zu  haben,  Gevatter  bei  der  Taufe  zu  stehen,  als  Becker  ,der  Mann  von 
Verstand  und  Charakter'.  Willich  hat  einmal  einen  Adjudanten  hinüber-  30 
geschickt,  Namens 
Dieser  erzeigte  nur  die  Ehre,  mich  rufen  zu  lassen, 
und  war  sehr  fest überzeugt,  daß  er  alle Verhältnisse von vornherein besser 
beurtheilen  könne,  als  irgend  jemand,  der  Tag  für Tag  den Thatsachen in's 
Auge  sah.  Er  bekam  daher  eine  sehr  geringe  Meinung  von  mir,  als  ich ihm 
mittheilte,  die  Offiziere  der preußischen Armee würden sich nicht glücklich  35 
schätzen,  unter  seinem  und  Willich's  Banner  zu  fechten,  wären  gar  nicht 
geneigt, die Willich'sehe Republik citissime zu erklären. Noch mehr erzürnte 
er,  als  kein  Mensch  unsinnig  genug  war,  seine  fertig  mitgebrachte  Auffor 
derung  an  die  Offiziere,  sofort  offen  zu  ,das'  sich  zu  erklären,  was  er  die 
Demokratie  nannte,  vervielfältigen  zu wollen. Wüthend verließ er  ,das von  40 
Marx  geknechtete  Köln'  (wie  er  nur  schrieb),  und  bewirkte  die  Verviel-

526 

Der  Ritter vom  edelmütigen  Bewußtsein 

f  ältigung  dieses  Blödsinns  in  einem  andern  Orte,  sandte  ihn  an  eine  Menge 
Offiziere  und  so  kam  es,  daß  das  keusche  Geheimniß  dieser  schlauen 
Methode,  die  preußischen Offiziere  zu Republikanern  zu machen,  von  dem 
,Zuschauer'  der  Kreuzzeitung  prostituirt  wurde. 

Wülich  erklärt  seinen  absoluten  Unglauben,  daß  Personen  von  dem 
,Charakter  und  Geist  Becker's'  über  sein  Projekt lachen konnten.  Er erklärt 
das  Aussprechen  dieser  Thatsache  für  eine  plumpe  Unwahrheit.  Wenn  er 
den  Kölner Prozeß gelesen hätte,  und  er  hatte doch wahrlich Ursache dazu, 
so  hätte  er  gefunden,  daß  Becker  sowohl  als  ich  das  in  dem  von  Ihnen 
veröffentlichten  Brief  enthaltne  Urtheü  über  seine Projecte  öffentlich  aus 
gesprochen  haben.  Wünschte  Wülich  eine  richtige  militärische  Schüderung 
der  damaligen  Verhältnisse,  die  er  nach  seiner  Phantasie  modelte,  so  kann 
ich  damit  dienen.

10 

Ich  bedaure,  daß  Wülich  nicht  allein  in  Weydemeyer  und  Techow  ehe-
15  malige Cameraden findet, die seiner militärischen Genialität und praktischen 
Auffassung  der  Verhältnisse  die  gewünschte  Bewunderung  versagen. 

W.  Steffen."  \ 

|15|  Nun  zur  Schluß-„Probe  von  der  Taktik  von  Marx". 

Herr  Wülich  giebt  eine  phantastische  Beschreibung  eines  im  Jahre  1851 
20  abgehaltenen Februarbanquets,  das  von Louis Blanc als  eine Gegendemon 
stration  gegen  das  Banquet  von  Ledru  Rollin  und  gegen  den  Einfluß  von 
Blanqui  veranstaltet  war.  „Herr  Marx  war  natürlich  nicht  zugezogen." 
Natürlich  nicht.  Es  konnte  sich  Jeder  für  sh. 2  zuziehen,  und  Louis  Blanc 
fragte  Marx  einige  Tage  später  mit  großem  Nachdruck,  warum  er  nicht 
erschienen  sei?  „Es  wurde  darauf  (worauf?  auf  dem  Banquet?)  ein  nicht 
gehaltner  Toast  Blanqui's  mit  einer  das  Fest  schmähenden  Einleitung,  in 
welcher  Schapper  und  Wülich  als  Volksverführer  bezeichnet  wurden,  als 
Flugschrift  in  Deutschland  unter  den  Arbeitern  verbreitet." 

25 

Der  „nicht  gehaltene  Toast  Blanqui's"  gehört wesentlich  zur  Geschichte 
30  des  edelmüthigen  Bewußtseins,  das  im  Glauben  an  den höhern Sinn  seiner 

Worte  mit  Entschiedenheit  zu  äußern  pflegt:  „Ich  lüge  nie!" 

Einige Tage nach dem Banquet brachte  die Pariser Patrie einen Toast, den 
Blanqui  auf  Verlangen  den  Festordnern  von  Belle  Isle  eingesandt  hatte, 
worin er  in  seiner gewohnten prägnanten Form  die gesammte provisorische 
35  Regierung von 1848 und spezieU den Vater des Banquets, Herrn Louis Blanc, 
geißelte.  Die  Patrie  stente  sich  verwundert,  daß  dieser  Toast  während  des 
Banquets  unterschlagen  worden  sei.  Sofort  erklärt  Louis  Blanc  in  der 
Londoner  Times,  Blanqui  sei  ein  abominabler  Intriguant  und  habe  dem 
Festcommittee  einen  solchen  Toast  nie zugeschickt.  Die  Hrn. Louis  Blanc, 
40  Landolphe,  Barthélémy,  Vidü,  Schapper  und  Willich  selbst  erklärten  im 

527 

Karl Marx 

Namen  des  Festkomittees  in  der  Patrie  den  fraglichen  Toast nie erhalten zu 
haben.  Die Patrie jedoch, bevor sie die Erklärung abdrucken ließ, erkundigte 
sich  bei  Herrn  Antoine,  Blanqui's  Schwager,  der  ihr  den  Toast  zur  Ver 
öffentlichung  mitgetheilt  hatte.  Unter  die  Erklärung  der  obengenannten 
Herren  druckte  sie  Antoine's  Antwort  ab:  er  habe  den  Toast  allerdings 
Barthélémy  zugeschickt und  von ihm  auch Empfangsanzeige erhalten.  Herr 
Barthélémy  erklärte  „darauf",  er  habe  den Toast zwar erhalten, ihn aber als 
unpassend  zurückgelegt,  ohne  dem  Committee  davon  Anzeige  zu  machen. 
Aber  leider  hatte  schon  vorher  der  ebenfalls  mitunterzeichnete  Exkapitain 
Vidil  der  Patrie  geschrieben,  sein  militärisches  Ehrgefühl  und  sein  Wahr-  10 
heitsinstinkt  drängen  ihm  das  Geständniß  ab,  daß  er  selbst,  Louis  Blanc, 
Willich  und  alle  die  anderen  in  der  ersten  Erklärung  gelogen  hätten.  Das 
Committe  habe  nicht  aus  den  genannten  sechs,  es  habe  aus  13  Mitgliedern 
bestanden.  Ihnen allen  sei der  Toast Blanqui's vorgelegt, von ihnen allen sei 
er  diskutirt  und  nach  längerer  Debatte  durch  eine  Majorität  von 7  gegen  6  15 
unterdrückt  worden.  Er  habe  sich  unter  den  6  befunden,  die  für seine  Ver 
lesung  gestimmt. 

5 

Man begreift den Jubel der Patrie, als sie, nach dem VidiT sehen Brief, die 
Erklärung  des  Herrn  Barthélémy  erhielt.  Sie  ließ  ihn  mit  folgendem  „Vor 
wort"  abdrucken:  „Wir  haben uns  oft  gefragt,  und  die Frage ist schwer  zu  20 
beantworten,  was  bei  den  Demagogen  größer  sei,  ihre  Ruhmredigkeit oder 
ihre  Dummheit:  Ein  vierter  Brief  von  London  vermehrt  noch  unsre  Ver 
legenheit.  Da  sind  ihrer,  wir  wissen  nicht  wie  viele  arme  Teufel,  in  einem 
solchen Grade gemartert von der Wuth zu schreiben und ihren Namen in den 
reaktionären Blättern genannt zu sehen, daß sie selbst vor einer grenzenlosen 
Beschämung  und  Selbstherabsetzung  nicht  zurückschrecken.  Was  liegt 
ihnen  am  Gelächter  und  der  Indignation  des  Publikums  —  das  Journal  des 
Débats,  die  Assemblée  Nationale,  die  Patrie  werden ihre  Stylübungen  ab 
drucken;  um  dies  Glück  zu  erreichen,  ist  kein  Preis  der  kosmopolitischen 
Demokratie  zu h o c h . ..  Im Namen der literarischen Commisération nehmen  30 
wir  daher  den  folgenden  Brief  des  Bürgers  Barthélémy  auf;  er ist ein neuer, 
und  wir  hoffen  der  letzte  Beweis  für  die  Aechtheit  des  nur  zu  berühmten 
Toastes  Blanqui's,  den  sie  erst  Alle geläugnet,  und für  dessen  Betheuerung 
sie  sich  jetzt  untereinander  in  die  Haare  gerathen."  Soweit  die  Geschichte 
des  Blanqui-Toastes.  Die  société  des  proscrits  démocrates  socialistesbrach 
in  Folge  des  „nicht  gehaltnen  Toastes  Blanqui's"  ihr  Kartell  mit  dem  Ver

Manteuffel's  Speech—Religious  Movement  in  Prussia-

From  Our  Own  Correspondent. 

New-York Daily Tribune. 
Nr. 3948,12. Dezember 1853 

London,  Tuesday,  Nov. 29,  1853.

Yesterday morning the  Prussian Chambers  were  opened by  a  speech of  the 
Prime  Minister,  Mr. Manteuffel.  The  passage  relative  to  the  eastern  com 
plication,  as  communicated  to  us  by electric telegraph, is  couched in terms 
clearly  intended  to  allay  the  suspicions  afloat  with  respect  to  a conspiracy 
between  the  courts  of  St. Petersburg,  Berlin,  and  Vienna.  It  is  the  more 
remarkable  as it is generally known that Frederick William IV, by the organ 
of  the  same  Manteuffel,  has  condescended  at  various  previous  occasions, 
to solemnly communicate to his loyal people, that the Chambers have no call 1 o 
to  intermeddle  with  matters  of  foreign  policy,  since  the  external  relations 
of  the  state  f  ah  as  much  under  the  exclusive  control  of  the  crown,  as  the 
king's  own  demesne  lands.  The  above  mentioned  passage,  involving  as  it 
does,  something like an appeal to the people, betrays the extreme difficulties 
the  Prussian government finds  itself placed in, menaced on the one hand by  15 
Russia  and  France,  and  on the  other  by  its  own  subjects,  at the  same time 
that  it  is  stimulated  by  the  high  price  of  provisions,  a  deeply  depressed 
commerce,  and  the  remembrance  of  an  atrocious  breach of  faith  still to  be 
expiated.  The  Prussian government  itself  has  cast  off  the refuge of working 
on public opinion through the means of the Chambers, which are dehberately  20 
constituted by the king as  a mere  sham, intentionally treated by the ministers 
as  a  mere  sham,  and  accepted  by  the  people  as  a  mere  sham,  in  a  manner 
not  to  be  misunderstood.  It  will  not  do  to  tell  them  now  that  these  mock 
institutions are,  all of a sudden, to be looked upon as the bulwarks of "Father 
Land."  "The Prussians,"  says  The Times of to-day, "have hardly shown the  25 
sense  and  sagacity  for  which  they  once  had credit,  by  the  undeserved  con 
tempt into which they have allowed the  Chambers, elected under the present 
constitution,  to  fall."  On the  contrary,  the  Prussians  have fully  shown their 
good  sense,  by  allowing  the  men  who  betrayed  the  revolution in  the  hope 

530 

Mariteuffel's  Speech—Religious  Movement  in  Prussia—Mazzini's  Address—Labor  Parliament 

of  reaping  its  fruits,  to  enjoy  not  even  the  appearance  of influence,  and to 
prove  to  the  government  that  they  are  not  the  dupes  of its  juggle,  and that 
the  Chambers,  in  their  opinion,  if  they  are  anything  at  all,  are  but  a  new 
bureaucratic  institution,  added  to  the  old  bureaucratic  institutions  of  the

Every  one  not  thoroughly  acquainted  with  the  past  history  of  Germany 
will be at a loss to understand the religious quarrels  again and again troubling 
the  otherwise  dull  surface  of German society. There are the remnants of the 
so-called  German  Church,  persecuted  now,  as  eagerly  as  in  1847,  by  the 
10  established governments. There is the question of marriages between Catho 
lics  and Protestants,  setting the Catholic clergy and the Prussian Government 
by  the  ears,  as  in  1847.  There  is,  above  all,  the  fierce  combat between  the 
Archbishop  of  Friburg,  excommunicating  the  Baden  Government,  and hav 
ing  his  letter  publicly  read  from  the  pulpits,  and  the  Grand  Duke  ordering 
the recreant churches to be closed, and the parish priests to be arrested; and 
there  are  the  peasants  assembling  and  arming  themselves,  protecting  their 
priests  and  driving  back  the  Gendarmes,  which  they  have  done  at  Bishof  s-
heim,  Königshofen,  Grünsfeld,  Gerlachsheim,  where  the  Mayor  of  the 
village  was  forced  to  fly,  and  at many  other villages.  It would be  a  mistake 
to  consider  the  religious  conflict  in  Baden  as  possessed  of  a  purely  local 
character.  Baden is only the battle-ground the Catholic party has deliberately 
chosen  for  attacking  the  Protestant  princes.  The  Archbishop  of. Friburg 
represents  in  this  conflict  the  whole  Catholic  clergy  of  Germany,  as  the 
Grand Duke of Baden represents all the great and small potentates confessing 
the  reformed  creed.  What  then  are  we  to  think  of  a  country  renowned  on 
the  one  hand  for  the  profound,  bold  and  unparalleled  criticism  to  which  it 
has  subjected all religious traditions, and surprising, on the other, all Europe, 
at periodically recurring  epochs,  with the  resurrection of the religious quar 
rels  of  the  17th  century?  The  secret  is  simply  this,  that  all  popular  com-
30  motions,  lurking  in  the  back-ground,  are  forced  by  the  governments  to 
assume  at  first  the  mystical  and  almost  uncontrollable  form  of  religious 
movements.  The  clergy,  on  their  part,  allow  themselves  to  be  deceived  by 
appearances,  and,  while  they  fancy  they  direct the  popular passions  for  the 
exclusive  benefit  of  their  corporation,  against  the government, they  are, in 
truth,  the  unconscious  and  unwilling  tools  of  the  revolution itself.

The  daily  London  press  exhibits  a  great  show  of  horror  and  moral  in 
dignation  at  an  address  issued  by  Mazzini,  and  found  in  the  possession  of 
Felice  Orsini,  leader  of  the  National  Band  No. 2,  destined  to  rise  in  the 
province  of  Lunigiana,  which contains  portions  of  Modena, Parma,  and the 
40  Kingdom  of  Piedmont.  In  this  address  the  people  are  exhorted  to  "act  by 
surprise, as the people of Milan tried to do, and will again." The address then 

531 

Karl Marx 

5 

says:  "The  dagger, if it strikes unexpectedly, does good service and supplies 
the place of muskets."  This  the  London press represents  as  an open appeal 
to  "secret,  cowardly  assassination.  "  Now  I  want  only  to  know  how,  in  a 
country like Italy, where public means of resistance are nowhere, and pohce 
spies are everywhere, an insurrectionary movement could expect any chance 
of  success  if  surprise be  not  resorted  to?  I  want  to  know,  if  the  people  of 
Italy  are  to  fight with the troops  of Austria at all, with what kind of weapons 
they  are  to fight except with those left to them—with the  daggers Austria has 
not  succeeded  in  taking  away?  Mazzini  is  far  from  telling  them  to  use  the 
dagger  for  cowardly  assassination  of the  unarmed foe—exhorts  them to  use 
it  "by  surprise,"  it  is  true,  but  in  the  broad light of  day,  as  at Milan, where 
a  few  patriots,  armed  only  with  knives,  rushed  on  the  guard-houses  of the 
armed  Austrian  garrisons.  But,  says  The  Times,  "constitutional  Piedmont 
is  to  undergo  the  same  fate  as  Rome,  Naples,  and  Lombardy!"  Why  not? 
Was  it  not  the  King of  Sardinia who betrayed the  Italian revolution in  1848  15 
and  in  1849,  and  can  Italy  be  transformed  into  a  Republic  with  a  King  of 
Piedmont  any  more  than  Germany  with  a  King  of  Prussia?  So  much  as  to 
the  morahty of Mazzini's address. As to its political value, it is quite another 
question.  I,  for  my  part,  think Mazzini to  be  mistaken,  both in his  opinions 
about  the  Piedmontese  people  and  in  his  dreams  of  an  Italian  revolution,  20 
which he supposes is not to be effected by the favorable chances of European 
complications,  but  by  the  private  action  of  Italian  conspirators  acting  by 
surprise.

You will  have  seen by the London papers that Government has  appointed 

a commission for inquiring into the corrupt practices and the whole organiza-  25 
tion of  that most venerable  body  known  as  the  Corporation of the  City.  The 
following  are  some  of the  facts  contained  in the  reports  of the  commission, 
whose  labors  are  still  far  from  having  arrived  at  a  close: 

The  revenue  of  the  Corporation  of  London  is  estimated  at  £400,000, 
without  taking  all  items  into  account,  and  the  gross  amount  paid  away  in  30 
salaries reaches  the  very  considerable  sum  of £107,000, or more than 25 per 
cent, of the whole income. The legal salaries are set down at £14,700, of which 
the  Recorder  receives  £3,000, the  Common Sergeant, £1,500,  and  the Judge 
of the Sheriff's Court, £1,200. The Town Clerkreceives £1,892; the Secretary, 
£1,249,  and  the  Remembrancer,  £1,765.  The  Chief  Clerks  at  the  Mansion-  35 
House  and  Guildhall receive between them £1,250  a year.  The Mace-bearer 
receives £550,  and  the  Sword-bearer  £550;  the  Upper  Marshal £450 or £500, 
the  Under  Marshal  £200  or  £300.  These  Bumbles  draw  besides,  £70  for 
uniforms, £14 for boots,  and £20 for  cocked  hats.  Mr. Bennoch  stated in his 
evidence  that  "the  whole  expense  of the  estabhshments  in the  Corporation  40 
of  London  is  much  greater  than the  whole  expense  of  the  Federal  Govern-

532 

Manteuffel's  Speech—Religious  Movement  in  Prussia—Mazzini's  Address—Labor  Parliament 

ment  of  the  United  States,  or,  what  is  perhaps  a  more  startling  statement, 
its  expenditure  upon  itself,  in  administering  the  funds  of  the  Corporation, 
is  larger  than  the  whole  amount  of  revenue  from  rents,  tolls  and fees  from 
brokers  which  it  receives."

The  great  secret  of  the  Reform  pills  Lord  John  Russell  intends  to  ad 
minister  to  the  British public  has  at last come  out.  He proposes:  1,  a repeal 
of  the  property  qualification  for  members  of  Parliament,  a  qualification 
which  has  long  since  become  a  nominal  one;  2,  a  readjustment of the con 
stituencies  by doing away with  some  small boroughs  and  adding more large 
10  ones;  3,  a  reduction  of  the  county  constituencies  from  the  £20  to  the  £10 
borough qualification.  A  fourth proposition to  lower  the  franchise  to £5 has 
been  abandoned,  as  by  this  means,  says  The  Times,  "the  present  electors 
would  be  virtually  disenfranchised,  because  the  class  to  be  admitted  will 
greatly  outnumber  all  others  put together,  and has  only to be unanimous  to 
15  be  supreme."  In other  words,  enfranchising  the  majority even of the  small 
trading  class  would  disenfranchise  the  minority.  A very ingenious  argument 
this.  The most important feature  of  the  Reform  bill looming in the future is, 
however, not this point, or all its points taken together. This important feature 
is the general and  absolute indifference its announcement meets with. Every 
20  Police  report  attracts  a  great  deal  more  of  public  attention  than  the  "great 
measure, " the  new  Reform  bill,  the  common  work  of  the  "Ministry  of  all 
the  talents." 

Ernest Jones was  quite  right in anticipating that the  first note  sounded  of 
the  mass  movement  of  the  people  and  a  national  organization headed by  a 
25  Labor  Parliament  would  strike  alarm  into  the  moneyed  classes,  and force 
the London class papers to take notice of it. The Times has immediately seen 
the importance of this new movement, and has given for the first time a report 
of  the  Chartist  meeting  held  in  the People's Institute  at Manchester.  All its 
cotemporaries  are  filled with leading articles on the labor movement and the 
30  Labor Parliament proposed by the  Chartists, who were long since supposed 
to  have  died  of  exhaustion.  The  Economist has  no  less  than four  articles  on 
the  question.  The  reports,  however,  of  the  highly  important  meeting  at 
Manchester cannot be  said to  afford any idea of its  character or the business 
there  transacted.  I  think  fit,  therefore,  to  give  a  report  of  my  own.  The 
following  resolutions  were  proposed  and  adopted: 

35 

" 1.  That  this  meeting,  after  witnessing the  futility  of  sectional  struggles 
on  the  part  of  isolated bodies  of  workingmen to  maintain  a just  standard  of 
wages  and  to  achieve  the  emancipation  of  labor,  is  of  the  opinion  that  the 
time  has  now  arrived  when  a  united  and  mass  movement  of  the  working 
40  classes, based on a national organization,  and guided by one directing body, 
can alone insure adequate  support to the men now locked out of employment 

533 

Karl Marx 

and on strike, and enable workingmen in the future to emancipate labor from 
the  thraldom  of  capital.  The  mass  movement  of  the  people  and  national 
organization  be  not  intended  to,  and  shall  not,  interfere  with  the  present 
Trade  Unions  and  combinations  of  workingmen,  but  that  its  action  be  to 
centralize,  concentrate  and  confederate  the  strength of  all, and of the entire 
body  of  workingmen. 

5 

2. That  to  carry  the  foregoing resolution it will  be  imperatively necessary 
that  a  Labor  Parliament  should  meet  as  soon  as  possible; that Parliament to 
consist  of  delegates  elected  by  the  workingmen  of  each  town  in  public 
meeting  assembled.  That the  duties  of  that  Parliament  shall be  to organize  10 
machinery whereby  support may be rendered to the people now out on strike, 
or  locked  out by  the manufacturers, by raising a national subscription of the 
most  extensive  character  to  lay  down  a  specific  plan of  action for  the  guid 
ance  of  the  working  classes  in  their  contest  with  the  employers,  and  to 
propound  the  means  by  which  labor  may  be  emancipated  from  the  undue 
influence  of  capital  and  become  independent,  self-employing  and  re 
munerative,  without  the  necessity  of  strikes. 

15 

3. That this meeting elect a Committee to correspond for the above purpose 
with the  various  towns  and  districts  to  make all necessary arrangements for 
the calling of the Labor Parliament, and to arrange and publish the necessary 20 
details for the  sitting of the delegates,  as well as  a programme of the business 
to  be  brought  before  the  delegation." 

By  far  the  most remarkable  speech was  that of  Mr. Jones, of which I give 

some  extracts: 

"The  employer  says,  in  The London  Times,  you  have  nothing  to  do  with  25 

his  profits.  You  must  only  count  your  own  heads,  not  his  profits.  If  there 
are  many heads, although you want more, you will get less. And that he calls 
the  law  of  supply  and  demand.  That  alone,  he  says,  should  regulate  your 
wages.  But does  it?  No!  If you've  no business to claim a rise of wages when 
his  profits  are  high,  he  should not pull  you  down when his  profits become  30 
low.  But  then  he'll  tell  you,  though  not  one  hand  less  may  be  employed— 
'trade's  bad,  times  are  hard,  my  profits  have  grown  smaller—I  can't  afford 
to  pay  you  the  same  wages.'  It  is  not  the  law  of  supply  and demand, then, 
but  the  law  of  dear  cotton  and  small  profits  that  regulates  your  labor.  The 
law  of  supply  may be  true,  but the  law  of  life  is  truer.  The  law of demand  35 
may be  strong, but the law of  starvation will be  stronger  still! We say, if the 
one  capital, money, has a right to profits, so has the other capital, labor, too ; 
and  labor  has  the  greater right, because  labor  made  money,  and not  money 
labor. What is profit? The  capital that remains  after deduction of all working 
charges.  The  wages  you  have  hitherto  received  are  merely a portion of the  40 
working charges. That which only keeps  soul and body together is no reward 

534 

Manteuffel's  Speech—Religious  Movement  in  Prussia—Mazzini's  Address—Labor  Parliament 

15 

for  toil.  It  is  merely  the  necessary  cost  of  keeping  the  human  machine  in 
working  order.  You  must  have  a  surplus  over  and  above  the  working  cost 
of  feeding  and housing the  machine  of flesh and blood. You must have food 
for  heart  and  brain,  as  well as for the mouth and belly.  The employer dreads 
5  your  getting  more  wages;  not  because  he  can't  afford  to  pay  them,  for  his 
capital has increased more than 100 per cent, in the last seven years, and you 
asked  for  only  10  as  your  wage  out  of  his  100  on  your  work.  He  dreads  it, 
because  higher  wages  would  lead  to  independence;  he  dreads  it,  because 
higher  wages would lead to  education;  he  dreads it, because  an enlightened 
10  people  will  not  be  slaves;  he  dreads  it,  because  he  knows  you would  then 
no  more  submit  to  work  so  many  hours;  he  dreads  it,  because  you  would 
then  not  allow  your wives  to  slave  in the factory hell;  he  dreads  it, because 
you  would  then  send  your  children  to  school instead of the  mill; he  dreads 
it,  because  he  knows  if  the  wife  was  at  the  fireside, the  child  at the  school 
and  short time  at  the  factory, the  surplus hands that now beat wages  down 
would  flee  from  his  control  and labor would become  a priceless pearl, gem 
ming the diadem of human freedom. But the question has once more changed 
its  aspect:  it is  not merely one of obtaining a share in the employer's profits, 
or  a rise  of  10  per  cent.;  it  is  one  of  preventing  a  fall  of  20.  Good trade or 
20  bad  trade  makes  little  change  to  them:  in  the  one  they  plunder  the  world 
abroad—in the  other  they  plunder the world at home.  The question is rapidly 
changing  for  you,  not  into  one  of  lower  or  higher  wages,  but  into  one  of 
starvation  or existence; of life in the factory hell or dead at the factory door. 
The  capitalists,  those  Cossacks  of  the  West,  first  crossed  the  Danube  of 
25 labor's rights ; they have proclaimed their martial law of gold, and hurl starva 
tion into our ranks from the batteries of monopoly. Town after town is placed 
in  a  state  of  siege.  Non-employment  digs  the  trenches,  hunger  scales  the 
citadel  of  labor,  the  artillery of famine  plays  on the  lines  of toil.  Every day 
their  great  confederation  spreads;  every day their movement becomes  more 
30  national. How are you prepared to confront them? Your movement is running 
into  chaos  and  confusion.  As the  lock-outs  spread and your isolated  action 
continues,  you  will be poaching in each other's preserves; the  collectors of 
the one place will meet those of the others on the same ground—you will stand 
as foes where you should  shake hands as allies—you will weaken each other's 
35  help where you  should help each other's weakness. The Wigan colliers were 
close to Preston, to  Stockport, to Manchester, to  Oldham, and they were left 
to  fall unaided.  The factory  operatives  are on strike at Wigan too. And what 
do  they  say  to  the  defeat  of  their  brother  workingmen  the  miners?  They 
consider it a happy riddance. They cannot help it—because they stand in each 
40  other's way.  But why do they so stand? Because you hedge your movement 
within  the  narrow  hmits  of  one  trade,  one  district  and  one  interest.  The 

535 

Karl Marx 

movement  of  your  employers  is  becoming  national,  and  national  must  be 
your  resistance  also.  As it is  you  are  ranning  into  anarchy  and ruin.  Do  not 
suppose  that  I  impugn  the  wisdom,  conduct  or  integrity  of  the  Trades' 
Unions. 

But the leading strings that support the child become impediments that clog 
the  man.  That  isolation  which  worked  well  in  the  infancy  of  the  labor 
movement  becomes  ruin  in  its  manhood.  Let  all  the  trades  be  represented 
whose  support  you  seek.  Place  the  cause  of  labor  not  in  the  hands  of  one 
mill, or one  town, or even one district, but place it in the hands of a laborers' 
Parliament."

The War on the Danube. 

As we have  already observed, the retreat of the Turks from Oltenitza appears 
to  indicate  the  conclusion  of the  first epoch of the Turko-Russian war;  with 
it  at  least a first and distinct series of operations, beginning with the passage 
at  Kalafat,  seems  to  be  concluded,  to  make  room  either  for the tranquility 
of  winter-quarters,  or for the execution of new plans not yet developed. The 
moment  seems  opportune for a review of the campaign up to that epoch, the 
more  so  as  the  official  and  non-official  reports  of  the  only  action  of  con 
sequence  fought  on  the  Danube,  the  Russian  attack upon the Turkish tête-
de-pont  at  Oltenitza,  are  just  come  to  hand. 

On  the  28th  of  October  the  Turks  crossed  from  Widdin  to  Kalafat.  They 
were  hardly  disturbed  in  their  occupation  of  this  point,  except  by  recon-
noitering  skirmishes;  for  when  the  Russians  were  on  the  point  of  con 
centrating  an  effective force  at  Krajova for the  attack on  Kalafat, they  were 
disturbed by the  news of a second and more dangerous advance of the Turks, 
who,  on the  2d of November,  had crossed the  Danube  at  Oltenitza, whence 
they  seriously menaced the Russian communications.  Simulated and second 
ary  attacks  were  at the  same  time  made  by  the Turks  on  the  whole line of 
the  Danube  from  Widdin  to  Oltenitza,  but  these  either  found  the  Russians 
well  prepared,  or  were  not undertaken  with  a sufficient force to  deceive the 
enemy  and  lead  him  into  any  serious  error. 

The  corps  at  Kalafat,  therefore,  remained  unmolested  and  gradually  re 
ceived  reinforcements,  which  are  said  to  have  swelled  it  to  something like 
24,000  men.  But  as  this  corps  has  neither  advanced  or  suffered  a  repulse, 
we  may  for  the  present  leave  it  out  of  consideration. 

The  passage  at  Oltenitza  took  place  according to  Omer Pasha's  report in 
the  following way:  Oltenitza is  a village  situated  near  the  confluence  of  the 
Ardgish  River  and  the  Danube.  Opposite  the  mouth of  the  Ardgish there  is 
an  island  in  the  Danube;  on  the  southern  bank  of  this  river  the village  and 

540 

The War on the  Danube

fort of Turtukai  are  situated,  on  a  steep  bank rising to  some 600 or 700 feet, 
on  the  top  of  which  elevation the  fort of Turtukai is  constructed.  The guns 
of  Turtukai,  therefore, form  a most  effective  support  to  any  corps  crossing 
the  river  at  this  point.  On the  1st Nov.  the Turks  crossed over to the island 
and  there  threw  up  solid  entrenchments  during  the  night.  On  the  2d  they 
crossed  from  this  island  to  the  Wallachian  shore,  east of the  Ardgish.  Two 
battalions, with  100 horsemen and two guns passed in boats to the Wallachian 
side;  a  few  gun-shots  from  Turtukai  drove  the  Russian  outposts  from  a 
lazaretto  building  situated  near  the  river  side,  and  this building, which was 
immediately  taken possession of by the Turks, proved a great advantage to 
them. It was massively constructed, with vaulted chambers, thereby offering, 
with hardly  any  additional labor,  all the  advantages of that great desideratum 
in field-fortification,  a  réduit.  Consequently  the  Turks  at once began throw 
ing  up  entrenchments  from  the  Ardgish  to  the  Danube;  four  hundred  men 
15  were  kept constantly employed,  gabions  and fascines  having been prepared 
beforehand.  From all the reports  we receive, we can only conclude that these 
entrenchments  were  continuous  lines,  cutting  off  entirely  every  com 
munication  from  the  Russian  positions  to  the  Turkish  points  of  landing. 
Fortification  by  continuous  entrenched  lines  has  been  long  since  generally 
condemned  and  found  ineffective;  but  the  special  destination  of  this  en 
trenchment  as  a  bridge-head,  the  fact  that  a  capital  réduit was  found  ready 
made,  the  want  of  engineers  among  the  Turks,  and  other  circumstances 
peculiar  to  the Turkish army, may have rendered it, after all, more advisable 
to  employ this  antiquated  system.  In the  Ardgish the  Turks found a number 
25  of boats  which were  at once  employed  together with what they had before, 
in  the  construction  of  a  bridge  across  the  Danube.  All  these  works  were 
nearly  completed  by  the  morning  of  Nov. 4. 

20 

30 

At  Oltenitza,  then,  the  Turks  had  a  mere bridge-head  on the left bank of 
the  Danube;  the  Turkish  army  had  not crossed the  river,  nor has  it  done  so 
since;  but  it  had  a  safe  débouché  on  the  left  bank,  which  might  be  turned 
to  account  the  very  moment  when  a  sufficient  force  was  concentrated  at 
Turtukai.  They  had  the  means,  beside,  of  taking  either  the  right  or the  left 
of  the  Ardgish;  and,  finally,  all  their  operations  in  the  vicinity  of  the  river 
were protected by ten heavy guns  in the fort on the hights of Turtukai, whose 
35 range, consequent upon this elevated position and the narrowness of the river 

at  that  point,  extended  at  least  half  a  mile  beyond  the  bridge-head. 

The bridge-head was  occupied by three battalions  of  the line, (2,400 men) 
two  companies  of  guards,  (160  men)  two  of  sharp  shooters,  (200 men) 
100 cavalry  and  some  artillery,  who  attended  to  the  12  heavy  guns  placed 
in  the  Lazaretto.  The  right  wing  of  the  entrenchment  was  enfiladed  and 
flanked  by  the  guns  of  Turtukai,  which  besides  could  sweep  the  whole  of 

40 

541 

Friedrich  Engels 

the  plain  in  front of the  center  of the  bridge-head.  The  left  wing,  resting  on 
the  River Ardgish, was  flanked  by the battery on the  island, but part of this 
ground  was  thickly  studded  with  brush-wood,  so  as  to  offer  considerable 
shelter  to  the  Russians  in  approaching. 

When  on  Nov. 4,  the  Russians  attacked  the  Turkish  lines  they  had,  ac 
cording  to  Omer  Pasha,  20 battalions,  4 regiments  of  cavalry  and  32 guns, 
altogether  about 24,000men.  It  appears  they formed  in  the  following order: 
twelve  battalions  and  14 guns  opposite  the  center  of the  bridge-head;  two 
battalions  and  two  guns  in  the  wood  to  the  left (Russian right) on the river 
Ardgish,  six battalions,  en  échelons, with four guns  against the Turkish right, 
toward  the  Danube,  their  line  being  prolongated  and  outflanked  by  the 
cavalry.  The  center  first  formed  a  column  of  attack,  after  the  fire  of  the 
Russian guns  had been kept up  for  a time;  the  two  wings followed; then the 
artillery,  which  had  first  fired  at  a  distance  of  some  1,200 yards  from  the 
parapets  came  up  to  effective  grape  range,  (600  to  700 yards,)  and  the 
columns  of  attack were  hurried forward.  As may be  anticipated, the column 
of  the  Russian  left  (nearest  the  Danube)  was  shattered  by  the  fire  of  the 
Turtukai  guns;  that  of  the  center very  soon shared the  same fate; that of the 
right  (on  the  Ardgish)  was  crushed  by the  fire  from  the  Island,  and  appears 
to  have  been  far  too  weak  to  do  any  good.  The  attack  was  once  or  twice 
repeated,  but without the  ensemble of  the  first  assault, and then the Russians 
had  enough  of it.  They  had  marched resolutely up  to  the  brink  of the  ditch, 
(which  must  not  be  too  literally  understood,)  but  the  Turkish  fire  proved 
overwhelming  before  they  came  to  a  hand-to-hand  fight. 

During  the  fight  Omer  Pasha  sent  a battalion of  regulars  across  the  river 
to act as reserve. Thus the Turks engaged may be estimated at 3,600  infantry, 
with 44  heavy  guns. 

The forces  of the  Russians  are  less  easily  ascertained. While Omer Pasha 
speaks of twenty battalions, two British officers in his camp agree in reducing 
the force  actually engaged to some 8,000 men. These two  statements are not 
exactly  contradictory.  The  Russians  might  have  some  twenty  battalions  in 
order  of  battle,  and  yet from  the  nature  of  the  ground,  of  from  contempt  of 
their  opponents, the  actual  mass  of the  attacking columns  might not exceed 
eight  battalions  at  a  time;  and  a  circumstance  which the  British officers  do 
not  mention,  but  which  Omer  Pasha reports,  shows  that  the  Russians  had 
ample  reserves.  It  is  this,  that  every  fresh  attack  was  headed  by  a  fresh 
battalion  drawn from  the  reserves  for  the  purpose.  Besides,  the  reports  of 
the  two  "officers  of  her  Majesty's  guards"  bear  in  every  line  the  stamp  of 
that ignorant  and inexperienced  self-sufficiency  which belongs  to  subalterns 
of  the  privileged  corps  of  all  armies. 

Upon  the  whole,  therefore,  we  think  Omer  Pasha's  statement entitled to

credit.  There  may  have  been eighteen  or twenty  Russian battalions  present 
during the  action, of which ten or twelve may successively have been brought 
to  act,  although from  six to  eight thousand may be the number of those who 
at a given time advanced simultaneously and inef f ectually upon the Turkish 
5 entrenchments. The loss of the Russians, which must have amounted at least 
to  1,500  or  2,000,  also proves what numbers they must have brought into the 
field. They were finally repulsed, leaving 500  muskets, plenty of baggage and 
ammunition,  and  800 killed  and  wounded  in  the  hands  of  the  Turks,  and 
retreated  partially  in  disorder.

If  we  look  at  the  tactics  of  this  conflict on either  side,  we  are  surprised 
to  find  a gross  blunder  committed  by  the  Russians,  which  was  deservedly 
expiated by their  signal defeat.  They  showed  a contempt of their adversaries 
which has  been  seldom  equaled.  They had to  attack pretty  strong lines, with 
a  capital  réduit  flanked  by  ten  heavy  guns  on  the  island,  commanded  by 
twenty-two guns at Turtukai, which also commanded the ground in front of 
the  lines;  altogether,  forty-four,  or  at  least  thirty-eight  guns,  ah  or  mostly 
of  heavy  metal.  Now  every  officer  knows  that  in  attacking  a  field  forti 
fication,  you have  first by  your  artillery  to  silence  its  guns  and the batteries 
that  may  support  it;  then  to  destroy,  as  much  as  possible,  the  parapets, 
20 palisades and other defenses ; then, by approaching your batteries still closer 
to  the  attacked works, to  sweep the  parapets  with  a continued hail-storm of 
grape-shot,  until  at last you  can risk launching your  columns of attack upon 
the  half-demolished  work  and  its  demoralized  defenders.  In order to  do  all 
this,  you must have  a decided  superiority in the  number  and caliber of your 
artillery.  But what do we  see the Russians attempt? To storm a bridge-head, 
defended  by  artillery  superior  to  their  own  in  number,  superior  in  caliber, 
and  still  more  superior  in  practice,  after  a  short  cannonade  from  twelve 
12-pounders  and  twenty  6-pounders!  This  Russian  cannonade  can  only  be 
considered  as  a  mere  formality,  a  sort  of  civility  offered  to  the  Turks,  for 
it  could  have  no  serious  purpose;  and  if,  as  aU reports  agree, the Russian 
batteries  advanced up to within 650 yards  of the bridge-head,  it is  a wonder 
that we  do  not  hear  of  a  number  of  dismounted guns.  At the  same time we 
must  acknowledge  the bravery  of the  Russian troops,  who  were  very hkely 
for the f irst time exposed to fire, and that under such adverse circumstances, 
35  yet  advanced  to  within  fifty  yards  of  the  Turkish  lines  before  they  were 

30 

25 

crushed  by  the  superior  fire  poured  in  upon  them. 

A s to the Turks, we cannot say much in favor of their tactics either.  It was 
very  well that  Omer Pasha  during  the  assaults  did  not crowd together  more 
troops  in  the  bridge-head  than  were  necessary  for  its  defense.  But  how  is 
40 it that he did not concentrate a reserve, especially of cavalry, on the Turtukai 
end  of  the  bridge  and  on  the  island?  that,  as  soon  as  the  repulse  of  the 

543 

Friedrich  Engels 

Russians was becoming manifest, he did not launch his cavalry on the beaten 
foe?  and  that,  after  all,  he  was  satisfied  with  the  moral  effect  of  the  victory 
and  neglected  to  gather  all  its  fruits,  by  which  he  might  have  decided  the 
campaign?  We  can  only  find  two  excuses:  Firstly,  that  the  system  of  con 
tinuous  lines  in  field-fortification  does  not  easily  admit  of  any  vigorous 
offensive  action  after  the  repulse  of  the  enemy,  as  the  uninterrupted  lines 
do  not  offer  any  wide  space  for  sudden  and  energetic  sallies  of  masses  of 
troops;  and  secondly,  that Omer  Pasha either  distrusted the  capacity  of  his 
troops for fighting in the  open field,  or that he had not troops  enough at hand 
to  follow  up  the  victory. 

5 

10 

This leads us to the strategic questions connected with this action. If Omer 
Pasha  had  had  at  Qltenitza  the  troops  who  were  lounging without  anything 
to  do  at  Kalafat,  would  he  not  have  acted with more  decision?  How  was  it 
that a corps  of  12,000  men,  with a reserve of equal force, was directed upon 
Kalafat,  to  menace  that  point  of  the  Russian  position,  where  of  all  points  15 
it  must have been  most  desirable to the Russians to be attacked?  How came 
it  that  on  the  point  where  the  Turks  could  gain  decisive  advantages  these 
24,000  men  were  not  present? 

But  this  is  only  one  point.  The  Russians,  it  is  now  ascertained  beyond 
doubt, could not muster more than 50,000 or 55,000 combatants in Wallachia  20 
at  the  end  of  October.  Taking  into  consideration  the  want  of  roads,  the 
intersected nature of the country, detachments not to be avoided, the regular 
wear  and tear of an active army, the Russians, it is certain, could on no point 
muster more than 30,000 men in a single mass.  Forty thousand Turks collect 
ed  upon  any  given  spot of  Wallachia were  sure  to  beat them,  and  there  is  25 
no  doubt that the  Turks,  if  they  had  been  so  minded  and taken proper steps 
in proper time, could  have  collected  that body,  or even twice  as many, with 
comparative  ease.  But the interference of European diplomacy, irresolution 
in  the  Divan,  vacillation  in  the  Turkish  policy  towards  Servia,  and  other 
similar  considerations,  appear  to  have  produced  a  series  of half-measures,  30 
which placed  Omer  Pasha in  a very  singular  position when hostilities  broke 
out.  He  knew  the  weakness  of  the  Russians;  he  himself  had  a far  superior 
army,  eager  to go to war; but his army was  spread upon an extent of country 
three  hundred  and fifty  miles  long,  and fifty to one hundred miles  wide. The 
lameness  of  his  operations  in the first half  of November was  the  necessary  35 
consequence  of  this.  The  passage  at  Kalafat,  otherwise  a  mistake,  thus 
became  a  sort of  necessity,  Widdin  being  the  natural  point of concentration 
of  some  twenty  thousand  men,  who  without that passage  would have been 
entirely  inactive,  being  too  far  distant  from  the  main  army.  This  passage 
enabled  them  at  least  to  paralyze  a  portion  of  the  Russian  forces,  and  to  40 
create  a  moral  impression  in  favor  of  the  Turks. 

544 

The War on the  Danube 

The passage at Oltenitza—which was intended evidently as the main attack 
by  which  Bucharest  was  to  be  taken,  and the  Russians  allured westward by 
the  Kalaf  at  operation,  to  be  cut  off  from  their  retreat—had  no  effect  what 
ever,  because  the  necessary forces for  a march  on Bucharest  appear  not to 
5  have  been  forthcoming.  The  moral  effect  of  the  combat  at  Oltenitza  was 
certainly a great gain, but the inactivity after the victory—an inactivity which 
lasted  nine  days,  and  ended  in the  voluntary  retreat of  the Turks behind the 
Danube, in consequence of the rains setting in—this inactivity and retreat may 
not  destroy  the  flush  of  victory  on the  cheek  of  the  Turkish  soldier,  but it 
1 o undermines the reputation of the Turkish General, most probably more than 
he  deserves.  But  here,  if  the  original  fault lies  with  the  Divan,  there  must 
be  some  fault  with  Omer  Pasha.  To  pass  twelve  days  on the left bank of the 
Danube,  to  possess  a  bridge  and  a  bridge-head  strong  enough to  repel  the 
united force  of the Russians, to have behind him an army numerous and eager 
to  fight  and  not  to  find  means  to  carry  30,000 or  40,000 men  across—why, 
all  this  cannot  have  been  done  without  some  negligence  on  the  part  of the 
General.  The Russians may be thankful for their escape. Never did aRussian 
army  get  out  of  a  scrape  half  as  bad  as  this  with  so  little  material damage. 
They  deserved  to  be  cut  to  pieces,  and they  are  all  safe.  Whether they will 
ever be  taken  at  such  advantage  again  may  well be  doubted.

No  more  fighting  of  any  account  has  taken  place  in  Turkey  since  my  last 
letter,  but Russian diplomacy,  more  dangerous than Russian generalship, is 
again  at  work,  and  the  revival  of  the  famous  London  Conferences  of  1840 
and  1841,  which  terminated  with  sanctioning the  treaty  of  Unkiar  Skelessi, 
under  a  slightly  altered  form,  is  more  or  less  clearly  announced through the 
medium  of  the  ministerial  papers  on  both  sides  of  the  Channel.  The  Times 
even  hints  at 
"vigorous  measures  of  pacification,"  viz:  a  sort  of  armed 
pacfication  directed  against  Turkey  by  her  self-styled  protectors.  There  is 
one great diplomatic fact not to be misunderstood, namely, the last Note sent 
by  the  English  Cabinet  to  Constantinople,  presented  by  the  British  Em­
bassador  to  the  Porte,  rejected  by  the  Divan  on the  14th Nov.,  and turning 
out to be but a second edition of Redschid Pasha's  answer to Prince Menchi-  15 
koff's  ultimatum  in  the  month of  May  last.  This  is  the  manner  in which the 
Palmerstons  and Aberdeens  give the  Sultan to understand that, however the 
face  of things  may  have  otherwise  changed,  the  relative  situations  of Turkey 
and  Russia have  undergone no  change whatever  since the month of May last, 
Turkey  having  won  nothing  nor  Russia  lost  anything  in  the  eyes  of Western  20 
diplomacy. 

10 

As  Prince  Alexander  of  Servia  forbids  the  Turkish  troops  to  cross  his 
territory,  asks  for  the  return  of  the  Russian  Consul-General,  and  treats,  in 
his  declaration to the  Sultan, Turkey and Russia as the two protecting powers 
placed  on the  same  footing with regard to  the  Principality,  serious  conflicts  25 
with  Servia  may be  apprehended,  which,  fatal  as  they  might have proved to 
Turkey  at any other moment, are at present perhaps, the only means of  saving 

546 

The Turkish War—Industrial  Distress 

her  from  the  claws  of  Western diplomacy.  Every new incident adding to the 
present  complication,  driving  bankrupt  Austria  out  of  her  dangerous  neu 
trality,  augmenting  the  chances  of  an  European  war,  and  enforcing  upon 
Turkey the  alliance  with the  revolutionary  party,  must turn out favorable to 
5 her, at least in her conflict with Russia. The constitutional causes of her decay 
will,  of  course,  continue  to  do  their  work,  if  not counteracted by thorough 
transformation  of  the  Turkish  rule  in  Europe. 

From the war carried on in the Principahties between Russians  and Turks, 
let us  return for one moment to the war raging in the manufacturing districts 
10  of  England  between  masters  and  men.  You will remember the  epoch when 
the  masters  fiercely  opposed  and  denounced  the  short-time  movement  on 
the  part  of  the  men.  Now  the  tables  are  turned,  and,  as  I  predicted  at  the 
time,  the  system  of  short  time  is  enforced by  the  masters  on the  men.  The 
lockout  exhibits  its  true  meaning  as  a  financial measure  on  the  part  of  the 
15  masters,  as  a  sort  of  antidote to  an industrial overproduction unparalleled 
in  the  "history of prices."  Since  Monday last the mills  have resumed work, 
but  only for four days per week, in the Rossendale district—Burnley, Bacup, 
Newchurch—at  Bury  in  the  Ashton  district—Ashton,  Stalybridge,  Glossop, 
Hyde,  Newton.  Bolton  will  soon  be  obliged  to  follow.  Manchester  is  de-
liberating  the  question  not  whether,  but  when,  to  give way.  In two  or three 
weeks  short  time  will  be  general,  save  in  some  few  favored  branches  of 
industry.  This, of course, must be followed by  a  stoppage  of the supplies to 
the  Preston  résistants.  But  even four  days  work  still overruns the  demand. 
Just  think that  not three  weeks  ago  the Preston masters  had on hand a stock 
25  equal  to  twenty  weeks'  production,  which  proved  almost  unsalable.  The 

20 

industrial  crisis  has  no  longer  to  begin;  it  has  fairly  set  in. 

"The  reduction of time,"  says  The  Times,  "is  accompanied by a reduction 
of  wages  to  the  standard  before  the  recent  advances  were  obtained by the 
hands."  "A  pauper  cannot dictate  conditions—he  must take what is  offered 
him,"  says  The  Economist,  in  a  fit  of  sincerity. 

30 

I have repeatedly  stated  that the turn-outs of the men, by beginning at too 
late  an epoch, when the  opportunities  afforded by unprecedented prosperity 
were  already  vanishing  away,  could  not prove  successful  in  an economical 
point of view, or as far as their immediate end was concerned.  But they have 
35  done  their  work.  They  have  revolutionized  the  industrial  proletariat,  and, 
stirred up by  dear food and cheap labor, the political consequences will show 
themselves  in  due  time.  Already  the  idea  of  a  Parliament of Labor, which, 
in fact,  means  nothing but  a general reassembling  of the  workingmen under 
the  banners  of  Chartism,  evokes  the  fears  of  the  middle-class  press. 
"Mr. Ernest Jones,"  says  The Economist,  "the editor of  The People's Paper, 
is described as the  successor of Mr. Feargus O'Connor, as Mr. O'Connor was 

40 

547 

Karl Marx 

the  successor  of  Mr. Hunt  . ..  From  following  Hunt  and  O'Connor,  the 
workingmen got nothing but hard knocks and great losses ; nevertheless, they 
place  equal  confidence  in  the  successor of these great kings,  and now look 
to  be  saved  by  Jones." 

From  the following quotations  you will  see  that the  English class papers, 
if  stimulated  by  party  motives,  as  is  the  case  with  The Morning Herald,  or 
if inspired, as The Morning Post, by a cynical but keen observer like Palmer 
ston,  know  how  to  judge  the  present  state  of  affairs,  and how to  deal with 
the  vulgarism  of  Prosperity-Robinson: 

5 

"To hear them  now,  you would  suppose  that the  authority of mill owners  10 

was  nothing  less  than  divine,  and that the  safety  of the empire depended on 
their  being  allowed  to  exercise  powers  little  short  of  those  of  the  French 
Emperor  . ..  Some  60,000  of  the  workingmen  of  Lancashire  are  at  this 
moment living on fare which barely suffices to keep  soul and body together, 
without  so  much  as  a thought of  a plunder  or  violence,  although in towns  15 
which  manufacturing  economy  has  left  wholly  unguarded  by  police.  Right 
or  wrong these  men have  stood by their opinions and their leaders manfully, 
and  it would  not be  easy to  find  another  instance  of  a movement  at once  so 
peacefully  and  so  effectually  carried  out." 

(Morning Herald.) 

20 

"Our  economists  boasted  of  the  overwhelming blessings which would  flow, 
past all our dreams, as the result of free trade ; yet there we are with the winter 
before us, and the pestilence only waiting the return of  spring, and just when 
our  poor  are  most in need of more than usual food and clothing to raise their 
physical system up to the point most capable of resisting disease—just at this  25 
time,  they  are  actually  crushed  by  the  unprecedented  high prices  of all the 
necessaries  of  life.  Not  a  sign  is  visible  of the  milk and honey that were  to 
enrich the  land;  while  all that was predicated of the perpetuity of cheapness 
and  plenty  seems  in  a  fair  way  of  being  classed  among  the  other  thousand 
popular  delusions  by  which  society  has  been gulled...  English  society is  a  30 
filthy,  pestilent,  immoral,  ignorant,  cruel,  blundering,  discontented,  and 
uncommonly  hard-up  community." 

Such  is  the  language  of  The  Morning Post,  the  drawing-room  print,  and 

the  official  organ  of  my  Lord  Palmerston.

The  Quadruple  Convention—England 
and the War. 

From  Our  Own  Correspondent. 

London,  Friday,  Dec. 9,  1853. 

5  Your readers  have followed,  step  by  step,  the  diplomatic movements of the 
Coalition  Cabinet,  and they  will  not be  surprised  at any new attempt, on the 
part  of  the  Palmerstons  and  the  Aberdeens,  to  back  the  Czar  under  the 
pretext  of  protecting  Turkey  and  securing  the  peace  of  Europe.  Even the 
resurrection of  a Vienna conference  or  of a London Congress they are fully 
10  prepared for.  The  Metropolitan Stock Exchange was first informed by  The 
Morning Chronicle,  on Friday last,  of  England  having  succeeded  in inducing 
Austria  and Prussia to  support the Western Powers in their attempt at a new 
mediation  between  the  belligerent  parties.  Then  came  The  Morning  Postwith 
the  news  of  "this  attempt"  and  with the consolatory announcement that "in 
this  attempt  the  cooperation  of  Prussia  and  Austria  has  been  sought  and 
obtained,  and  the  four  Powers  have  signed  a  protocol,  engaging  them,  im 
plicitly,  to  maintain  the  present  territorial  distribution  of  Europe,  and  inviting 
the belligerent Powers to come to an amicable adjustment of their differences 
by  means  of  an  European  conference.  The  first  step  that  will  be  taken,  in 
20  consequence  of  this  proceeding  of the four Powers,  will be to  ascertain the 
views  of  Turkey on the  bases  upon which  she  will  allow  negotiations for an 
arrangement of the Eastern dispute to be conducted. This clearly ascertained, 
the  four  Powers  will  then  invite  Russia  to  state  her  views  in  regard  to  the 
bases  of  the  proposed  arrangement,  and then both Powers will be requested 
to  send  plenipotentiaries to  a conference of the great Powers, at some  time 

15

and  place  to  be  hereafter  determined  upon  . ..  The  Czar's  dignity might  be 
preserved  while  the  interests  of  Turkey  would  be  fully  upheld  in  the  first 
place  by  a  treaty  between  Turkey  and  Russia  of  amity  and  peace  and  of 
commerce,  stipulating  for  a  due  protection  of  the  subjects  of  either  state 
within  the  territories  of  the  other,  and,  in  the  second  place,  by  a  treaty 
between  the  Sultan  and  the  five  Powers,  such  a  treaty  as  that  of  the  Darda­
nelles  of  1841,  in  which  the  Sultan  should  undertake  to  respect  the  existing 
constitutions  and privileges  of  the  Danubian  Principalities  and of Servia,  and 
in  which  he  should  bind  himself  as  in  the  treaty  of Kainardji,  but  this  time 
to Europe, a n d n o t to Russia—specially to protect the Christian religion within 10 
his  dominions."  At  last  came  the  thunderer  of  Printing  House-square,  an­
nouncing in a fir st edition that the alliance between the four Powers had been 
definitively  concluded,  and that they had laid down conditions  which Russia 
and  the Porte  would,  if  necessary,  "be  forced to  accept."  Instantly  the  funds 
rose; but the  satisfaction of the stock-jobbers proved short-lived, as the same 
Times announced in its  second edition that the four Powers had indeed drawn 
up  a  protocol  and  presented  the  draft  of  a  collective  note,  without  having, 
however,  bound  themselves  to  enforce its  acceptance.  Down went  the  funds 
again.  At  last the  "startling  news"  was  reduced to the old  story  of the resur­
rection  of  the  dead  body  of  the  late  Vienna  Conference—it  would  be  pre-  20 
posterous  to  speak  of  its  ghost—and  a  telegraphic  dispatch  confirmed  the 
report  that  "the  Conference  of  the  four  Powers  at  Vienna  had  on  the  6th 
forwarded  to  Constantinople  another  proposal  for  the  arrangement  of  the 
pending  differences  founded  on  a  new  project,  and  that  negotiations  for 
peace  will  continue,  even  though  hostilities  should  not  be  suspended."  On  25 
the  very  eve  of  war  the  Vienna  Conference,  that retrospective  Pythia,  had 
just  proposed  to  Turkey to  accept  Prince  Menchikoff's ultimatum.  After the 
first  defeat  Russia  had  undergone,  England  and  France  took  up  Rechid 
Pasha's  answer  to  Prince  Menchikoff's  ultimatum.  What  phase  of  the  past 
transactions  they  will  now  have  arrived  at in their  retrograde  movement,  it  30 
is  impossible  to  predict.  The  Augsburger Zeitung states  that the  newproposi-
tions  of  the  Conference  express  the  desire  of  the  four  Powers  to  "prevent 
war."  A  startling  novelty  this! 

15 

Insipid,  as  all  this  diplomatic  gossip  may  appear  at  a  moment,  when  the 

status  quo has  been  supplanted  by  a  status  belli, we  must not forget that the 
hidden  intentions  of  the  British  Cabinet  transpire  through these  fantastical 
projects  of  conferences  and  Congresses;  that  the  ministerial  papers  throw 
out  their  feelers  to  ascertain  how  far  the  Ministry  may  venture  to  go;  and 
that the unfounded rumors  of to-day more than once have foreshadowed the 
events  of  to-morrow.  So  much is  sure,  that  if  not  accepted by Austria, the  40 
quadruple  alliance  has  been  proposed  by  England  with  a  view  to  enforce 

35 

550 

The  Quadruple  Convention—England  and  the War 

10 

15 

upon  Turkey  the  resolutions  to  be  agreed  upon  by  the  four  powers.  If  no 
alliance  has  been  concluded,  a  "protocol"  has  at  least  been  signed by  the 
four  powers,  establishing  the  principles  upon  which  to  conduct  the  trans 
actions.  It  is  no  less  sure  that  the  Vienna  Conference,  which  prevented 
5  Turkey  from  moving  till  the  Russian  army  had  occupied  the  Principalities 
and reached the frontiers  of Bulgaria, has again resumed its work and already 
dispatched a new note to the  Sultan. That the  step from  a Vienna conference 
to  a European Congress,  at London, is by no means a great one, was proved 
in  1839  at the  epoch of Mehemet Ali's  insurrection.  The  Congress pursuing 
its  work  of  "pacification,"  while  Russia  pursued  her  war  against Turkey, 
would  be  but  a repetition  of  the  London  Congress  of  1827-29,  resulting  in 
the  destruction  of  the  Turkish  fleet,  at  Navarino,  and  the  loss  of  Turkish 
independence, by the treaty of Adrianople. The bases upon which the British 
Cabinet have proposed, and the other powers agreed to conduct negotiations, 
are clearly indicated by the Ministerial papers. Maintenance of the "present 
territorial  distribution  of  Europe."  It  would  be  a great  mistake  to consider 
this proposition as  a  simple return to  the provisions  of the peace of Vienna. 
The  extinction  of  the  Kingdom  of  Poland,  the possession of the  mouths  of 
the  Danube  by  Russia,  the  incorporation  of  Cracow, the  transformation of 
20  Hungary into an Austrian province—all these "territorial arrangements" have 
never  been  sanctioned  by  any  European Congress.  A  sanction,  then,  of the 
present  "territorial  distribution  of  Europe"  would  be,  instead  of  a  simple 
admission of Turkey to the treaty of Vienna, as is pretended, rather a sanction 
of all the violations  of that treaty by Russia and Austria, since 1830. "A treaty 
25  of amity,  and peace,  and commerce between Russia and Turkey"—such are 
the  identical  terms  in  the  preamble  of the treaties  of  Kainardji,  Adrianople 
and  Unkiar  Skelessi.  "A  treaty  like  that  of  the  Dardanelles  of  1841,"  says 
the  Palmerstonian  paper.  Exactly  so.  A  treaty  like  that  which  excluded 
Europe  from  the  Dardanelles  and  transformed  the  Euxine  into  a  Russian 
lake.  But,  says  The  Times, why should we not stipulate for the free entrance 
of  the  Dardanelles  for  men-of-war,  and  the  free  navigation of  the Danube. 
But  read  the  letter  addressed  by  Lord  Palmerston  in  September,  1839,  to 
Mr. Bulwer, the then Envoy at Paris, and we shall find that similar hopes were 
held  out  at  that  epoch.

35  "The  Sultan  bound  to  respect  the  existing  constitutions  of  the  Principalities 
and  Servia."  But these existing constitutions distribute the  sovereignty over 
the provinces between the  Czar and the Sultan, and they have, till now, never 
been  acknowledged  by  any  European  Congress.  The  new  Congress  then, 
would  add  to  the  de  facto  protectorate  of  Russia  over  Turkish  provinces, 
the  sanction  of  Europe.  The  Sultan  would  then be  bound  not to  the  Czar, 
but to Europe, to protect "the Christian religion within his dominions." That 

40 

551 

Karl Marx 

is  to  say,  the  right  of  interference  between  the  Sultan  and  his  Christian 
subjects  by  foreign  powers,  would  become  a paragraph  of  European inter 
national  law,  and,  in case  of any new conflicts  occurring,  Europe would be 
bound  by  treaty  to  back  the  pretentions  of  Russia,  who,  as  a  party  to  the 
treaty, would have a right to interpret in her sense, the protection to be asked 5 
for  by  the  Christians  in  the  Sultan's  dominions.  The  new  treaty,  then,  as 
projected by  the  coalition cabinet,  and as explained by its own organs, is the 
most  comprehensive  plan of European surrender to  Russia,  ever  conceived, 
and  a  wholesale  sanction  of  all  the  changes  brought  about by  the  counter 
revolutions  since  1830.  There  is,  therefore,  no  occasion  for  throwing  up  10 
caps  and  being  astonished  at  the  change  of  the  policy of Austria,  a change 
as  Ifte  Morning  Post  feigns  to  believe,  "effected  suddenly  within  the  last 
ten  days."  As  to  Bonaparte,  whatever  his  ulterior  designs  may  be,  for  the 
moment the Parvenu Emperor is  content enough to climb up  into the heaven 
of the old  legitimate powers, with Turkey as  his  ladder. 

15 

The views  of  the  Coalition Cabinet  are clearly expressed by  The Guardian, 

the  ministerial  weekly  paper: 

"To  treat  Russia  as  a beaten enemy  and fancy we  have  her  by the  throat 
because  Russian  troops  have  been  foiled  at  the  trenches  of  Oltenitza  and 
some forts captured on the Black Sea, is simply ridiculous ; these petty losses 20 
would  in  themselves  but  exasperate  her  pride  and indispose  her to  treat till 
she could do  so on better terms. But sovereigns, like other men, are governed 
by mixed motives. The Czar is a proud and passionate, but he is also a prudent 
man.  He  is  engaged  in  a  quarrel in which he may lose  and  cannot gain.  His 
policy  is  that  of  his  predecessors,  who  have  throughout  gained  more  by  25 
threatening  than  by  waging  war,  and whose  steady and  undeviating  system 
of  encroachment had in it a vein  of  elastic  phabihty,  which  enabled them to 
avoid  great  disasters  and  even  to  turn  minor reverses  to  profitable  account. 
The  preUminary  resolution of the four powers, that no change  shall be made 
or permitted  in  the  territorial  arrangement  of  Europe,  appears  to  be  based  30 
on  this rational view  of  his  position  and  pohcy.  It  will  disappoint those who 
see  in imagination the feet of England on his neck, or who  suffer themselves 
to  be  misled  by  the  chimerical  nonsense  of the  Protectionist papers.  But the 
business  in  hand  is  not  the  humiliation  of Russia,  but  the  pacification  of 
Europe (in a Russian sense of course,) the establishment, as far as possible,  35 
of  that  durable  peace  for  which  the  French  Soldier-Envoy  pledges  his 
master's  honor  to  the  Sultan.  And  the  coming  treaty,  we  may  be  sure,  will 
not be  a mere  restoration of  the  status  quo, but will attempt at least to  settle 
on  some  permanent footing the  relations  of Turkey  with Europe  and  of  the 
Turkish  Government  with  its  Christian  subjects,  attempt—for,  settle  it  so  40 
durably  as  we  may,  any  arrangement  which  leaves  a  Turkish  Empte  in 

552 

The  Quadruple  Convention—England  and  the  War 

Europe  will  always  be  provisional  at  bottom.  Such  a  provisional  arrange 
ment,  however,  is  the  thing  now  practicable  and  needful." 

The  ultimate  object,  then,  the powers  aim  at,  is  to  help  the  Czar  "to  turn 
minor  reverses  to  profitable  account,"  and  "to leave  no Turkish Empire in 
5  Europe."  The provisional arrangement will of  course, prepare  that ultimate 

consummation  as  far  as  "the  thing  is  now  practicable." 

Some  circumstances,  however,  have  singularly  confounded  the  calcula 
tions of the Coalition politicians. There is intelligence of new victories gained 
by  Turkey  on  the  shores  of  the  Black  Sea  and  on the  frontiers  of  Georgia. 
10  There  is,  on the other hand,  a peremptory assertion representing the whole 
army  in  Poland  as  under  orders  for  the  Pruth,  while we  are  informed  from 
the  frontiers  of  Poland  that  "in  the  night  from  the  23d  and  24th  ult.,  the 
branka, or levy of men for the army, took place, and in places, where formerly 
one or two men were taken, eight or ten have now been drawn." This, at least, 
15  proves  little  confidence  on  the  part  of  the  Czar  in  the  pacifying genius  of 
the  four  Powers.  The  official  declaration  on  the  part  of  Austria  "that  no 
alliance  had  been  concluded  between  the  four  Courts,"  proves  on her part 
that,  willing  as  she  is  to  enforce  conditions  upon  Turkey,  she  dares  not 
assume  even  the  appearance  of  coercing  the  Czar  to  submit  to  conditions 
20  projected  in  his  own  interest.  Lastly,  the  Sultan's  reply  to  the  French 
Embassador  that  "at present an amicable arrangement is  quite unacceptable 
without  the  complete  abandonment by  Russia  of the  pretensions  which  she 
has  raised  and  without the  immediate  evacuation of  the  principahties,"  has 
struck the  Congress-mongers  like  a thunderbolt,  and the  organ of the crafty 
and experienced Palmerston now frankly tells the other fellows of the broth 
erhood  the  following  piece  of  truth: 

25 

"To  the  immediate  evacuation  of the Principalities  and the total abandon 
ment  of  all  her  claims,  Russia  cannot  submit  without  a  loss  of  dignity  and 
influence which it is foolish to  suppose a power of her magnitude will endure 
30  without a desperate  struggle.  For this present attempt at negotiation  we  are 

sorry,  therefore,  that  we  can  only  prognosticate  failure." 

Defeated  Russia  can  accept  no  negotiations  at  all.  The  business  in  hand 
is,  therefore,  to  turn  the  balance  of  war.  But  how  to  effect  this,  but  by 
enabling  Russia  to  gain  time?  The  only  thing  she  wants  is  procrastination, 
time  to  levy  new troops,  to  distribute  them  throughout the empire—to con 
centrate  them,  and  to  stop  the  war  with Turkey  till  she  has  done  with  the 
mountaineers  of  Caucasus.  In this  way  the  chances of Russia may improve, 
and  the  attempt  at  negotiation  "may  be  successful  when  Russia  proves 
victorious  instead  of  defeated."  Accordingly,  as  stated by  the  Vienna  Ost-
deutsche  Post,  and  the ministerial Morning Chronicle, England has urged on 
Turkey  the  propriety  of  consenting  to  a  three  month's  armistice.  Lord 

35 

40 

553 

Karl Marx 

5 

Redcliffe  had  a  five  hour's  interview  with  the  Sultan,  for  the  purpose  of 
obtaining  from  His  Highness  that consent to  the  suggested  armistice  which 
his  ministers  had  refused,  and  the  result was,  that an  extraordinary  council 
of  ministers  was  convened to take the  matter into consideration.  The Porte 
definitively  refused  to  accede  to  the  proposed  armistice,  and  could  not 
accede  to  it  without  openly  betraying  the  Ottoman  people.  "In the  present 
state  of  feeling,"  remarks  the  to-day's  Times,  "it  will  not  be  easy  to  bring 
the  pretentions  of  the  Porte  within  the  bounds  of  moderation."  The  Porte 
is  immoderate  enough  to  understand  that  it  is  perfectly irreconcilable with 
the  dignity  of  the  Czar  to  be  defeated,  and that it must therefore grant him  10 
a  three  month's  armistice  in  order  to  frustrate  its  own  success,  and  to  help 
him  to  become  again  victorious  and  "magnanimous."  All  hope  of  bringing 
about the  three  month's  armistice  has  not yet been  parted with.  "Possibly," 
says  The  Times,  "an  armistice  recommended  by  the  four  powers  may  fare 
better."  The  good-natured  Morning Advertiser is  "unwilling  to  assume  that 
these  representations are correct," because "a mere direct attempt to betray 
the Ottoman cause into the hands of the Czar, or one better adapted to answer 
that purpose,  could not have been devised by the most ingenious mind." The 
confidence  of  the  radical  Morning  Advertiser  in  "the  honor  and  the  good 
faith" of Palmerston, and its ignorance of the history of England's diplomatic 20 
past,  seem  equally  incommensurable.  This  paper  being  the  property of  the 
Licensed  Victualler's  Association,  I  suspect  that  those  very  victualler's 
themselves  write  from  time  to  time  the  editorial  articles. 

15 

While England is thus occupied at Constantinople  and Vienna, the outpost 
of  Russia,  let us  see how on the  other hand,  the Russians  manage  affairs  in  25 
England. 

I have already, in a previous letter, informed your readers that at this very 
epoch, when the  Coalition feigns to threaten Russia in the Black Sea, Russian 
men-of-war,  the  two  frigates  Aurora  and  Navarino,  are  fitting  out  in  the 
Queen's  dock  yards  at Portsmouth.  On Saturday last we were informed by  30 
The  Morning Herald and  The  Daily News,  that  six  sailors  had  escaped  from 
the  Russian  frigate  Aurora,  and  nearly  reached  Guildford,  when they were 
overtaken  by  an  officer  of  the  Russian  frigate  Aurora  and  an  English  in 
spector  of  police,  brought back  to  Portsmouth,  placed  on  board the  Victo 
rious—an English ship occupied by the crew of the Aurora, while out-fitting—  35 
subjected  to  cruel,  corporeal  punishment  and  placed  in  irons.  When  this 
became  known  in  London,  some  gentlemen  obtained,  through  the  in 
strumentality  of  Mr. Charles  Ronalds,  solicitor,  a  writ  of  habeas  corpus, 
directed  to  Rear-Admiral  Martin,  some  other  English officers  of  the  navy, 
and to the Russian Captain, Commander of the frigate Aurora, ordering them  40 
to bring the  six sailors before the Lord Chief Justice of England. The English 

554 

The  Quadruple  Convention—England  and  the  War 

5 

dock-yard  authorities  declined to  obey  the writ, the English Captain appeal 
ing  to  the  Vice-Admiral  and  the  Vice-Admiral  to  the  Admiral,  and  the 
Admiral  feeling  himself  obliged  to  communicate  with  the  Lord  of  the  Ad 
miralty,  the  famous  Sir  James  Graham,  who,  ten  years  before,  in the  case 
of the Bandieras, placed the British Post-Office at the service of Metternich. 
As  to  the Russian Captain,  although the  Queen's  writ was  served on him on 
board  the  English  ship the  Victorious,  and though he  was  fully informed of 
its  nature  by an interpreter, he threw it contemptuously from the vessel, and 
when  thrust  through  a  port-hole,  it  was  thrown  out  again.  "If,"  said  the 
10  Russian  captain,  "it  came  from  Her  Majesty  in  reality,  it would  be  sent to 
his  Embassador  or  Consul."  The  Consul  being  absent,  the  Vice-Consul 
refused  to  interfere.  On  Dec. 6,  fresh  writs  were  served  on  the  naval  au 
thorities  at Portsmouth,  commanding them in the  Queen's  name to produce 
not  only  the  six  men  in  question  before  the  Lord  Chief  Justice,  but  the 
15  Russian captain also.  Instead of the writ being complied with, the Admiralty 
used  every  effort to  tow  the  ship  out  of the harbor and to get her to  sea, and 
the  other  day,  the  Aurora,  Capt. Isylmetieff,  was  seen,  by  daylight,  sailing 
for  the  Pacific,  defying  the  writ  of  the  habeas  corpus.  In  the meantime,  as 
we  are  informed,  by  yesterday's  Daily News,  "the  Russian  corvette,  Nava-
rino, is still in dock, undergoing a thorough re-caulking and repair. A number 
of  dockyard  men  are  engaged  on  her." 

20 

Now  mark in what manner this  "startling" case has been dealt with by the 

Ministerial  Press. 

The  Morning Chronicle,  the  Peelite  organ,  chose  to  remain  silent, its  own 
25  Graham  being  the most compromised man in the whole  affah.  The Palmer-
stonian  Morning Post was  the  first  to  break  silence,  as  its  Lord  could  not 
let  escape  such  an  occasion  of  proving  his  mastership  in  making  pleasant 
apparently difficult cases. The whole case, it stated, was greatly exaggerated 
and  overrated.  The  six  deserters,  it  stated  on  the  authority  of  the  Russian 
30  Captain, Who  ordered them  to be cruelly flogged and hulked, "these seamen 
say  that  they  did  not  desert  from  their  own  inclination,  but  were  inveigled 
away  by  persons  who  introduced  themselves  to  them  in the  streets,"  these 
seamen  having also contrived against their inchnation and against the orders 
of  the Russian Captain to get ashore at Portsmouth,  "made them  intoxicated 
and then took them  away  in  a carriage, up the country,"  and then deserted 
the  deserters,  "giving them directions  how to get to London, with the address 
of  some  persons,  to  whom to go when there."  The  absurd  story  is  invented 
by the Palmerstonian organ with  a view  to  induce  the  public to believe, that 
the  "deserters  gave  themselves  up  to  the  Police,"  a  he  too  gross  to  be 
reechoed  by  The  Times  itself.  The  whole  affair  insinuates  The Post,  with  a 
great  show  of  moral  indignation,  was  got  up by  some  Pohsh refugees,  who 

35 

40 

555 

Karl Marx 

probably,  intended  wounding  the  feelings  of  Lord  Palmerston's  magnani 
mous  master. 

Another ministerial organ, The Globe, states that "the plea that a foreigner 
is  only bound to  recognize  processes  coming to him from the minister of his 
own  country  is  manifestly  untenable;  otherwise,  any foreigners  in  a British 
seaport  could  break  our  law  and  could  be  brought  under no  responsibility, 
except  by  the  intervention  of  an  Embassador."  The  Globe arrives therefore 
at the  moderate  conclusion that  the  reply of the Russian captain to the clerk 
who  served  on him the writ of habeas corpus  "is  not perfectly satisfactory." 
But in human matters it would be idle to aspire to  anything like perfection. 

"If  the  Russian captain had  hanged  them  (viz.,  the  six recaptured sailors) 
all  at  the  yard-arm  of  his  frigate  the  next  morning,  he  would  have  been 
altogether  beyond the  control of the  English law,"  exclaims  The  Times.  And 
why this?  Because in the treaty of navigation concluded between Russia and 
Great  Britain  in  1840  (under  the  direction  of  Lord  Palmerston)  there  is  a 
provision  to  this  effect: 

"The  Consuls,  Vice-Consuls,  and  commercial  agents  of  the  high  con 
tracting  parties,  residing  in  the  dominions  of  the  other,  shall  receive  from 
the  local  authorities  such  assistance  as  can  by  law  be  given  them,  for  the 
recovery  of  deserters  from  the  ships  of  war  or  merchant  vessels  of  their 
respective  countries." 

But,  good  Times,  the  question  is  exactly  what  assistance  the  English 
authorities  were  warranted  by  law  to  give  the  Russian  Captain.  As  to  the 
Russian  authorities  themselves,  "sending  their  vessels  to  England  to  be 
repaired  at  this  crisis  in  political  affairs,"  it  appears  to  The  Times,  "to  be 
an act of great indelicacy and bad taste," and it thinks, "the position, in which 
the  officers  of  these  vessels  have  been  placed  here,  is  that  of  spies."  But, 
it says,  "the British Government could no more forcibly express its contempt 
for  such politics,"  than by  admitting the Russian spies into the Queen's own 
dockyards  "even at some public inconvenience," by placing at their disposal 
British  men-of-war,  employing  the  dock  yard  men,  paid  out  of the  pockets 
of the British people, in their  service, and firing parting salutes to them, when 
they  run  away  after  having  insulted  the  laws  of  England.

"With  the  fleets  of  France  and  England  in  the  Black  Sea,  the  astonished 
Sultan  of  Turkey  is  already  surprised that one  of his  ships  is captured  with 
impunity  by  a  Russian  vessel.  The  spring will  bring  him  further wonders." 
Thus  we  were  informed  by  last  Saturday's  Press.  The  following  Monday 
brought the "further wonders," not expected until spring. Defeat of aTurkish 
squadron  by  a  Russian  fleet  in  the  Black  Sea,  off  Sinope—such  were  the 
contents  of  a  Russian  dispatch  from  Odessa,  dated  5th  inst.,  confirmed 
afterward  by  the  French  Moniteur.  Although  we  are  not  yet  in  possession 
of  the  exact  details  of  this  occurrence,  so  much  is  clear  that  the  Russian 
report  greatly  exaggerates  the  case;  that  the  whole  matter in question is  to 
15  be  reduced  to  the  surprise  of  some  Turkish frigates  and  a certain number 
of  transports,  which  had  on  board  troops,  provisions,  amunition and  arms, 
destined  for  Batum;  that  the  Russian  force  was  largely  superior  in number 
to  the  Turkish  one,  and that,  nevertheless,  the  latter  only  surrendered  after 
a  desperate  engagement,  lasting  an  hour. 

20 

"Our  fleet,"  says  the  Englishman,  "at  all  events,  is  not there  to  prevent 
the  Russians  from  attacking Turkey.  The  fleet  is  not there  to  interfere  with 
Russian  convoys  of  men  and  arms  to  the  Caucasus.  The  fleet  is  not there 
to  see  that the  Black  Sea is  not a Russian lake.  The fleet is  not there to help 
our  ally,  nor  to  save  him  from  destruction.  The  fleet  is  n oi  there  to  avert  a 
25  Navarino, after the memorable p a t t e r n . .. Russian Admirals may maneuver, 
we  suppose,  within  gun-shot of  Constantinople,  and  the  screws  of  England 
will  continue  as  impassive  as  the  prime  screw  of  Lord  Aberdeen  himself. 
Will  these  costly  farces  be  tolerated  by  the  people?" 

557 

Karl Marx 

The  coalition  is  exasperated  at  the  Czar  having  beaten  the  Turks  at  sea 
instead of on the  ierra fuma.  A victory of the latter sort they wanted. Russian 
successes  at  sea may  endanger  their  places,  just at the moment when Count 
Buoi  has  assured  the  Sultan  of  the  Czar's  strictly  defensive intentions,  and 
when Lord Redcliffe was urging on him  a three months' armistice. It is very 
amusing to observe how the business  of  soothing  down the  public  has  been 
distributed  between  the  several  organs  of  the  Coalition  Ministry. 

5 

The  Times,  as  the  representative  of  the  whole  of  the  Cabinet  expresses 
its general indignation at the ingratitude of the Czar, and ventures even upon 
some menaces. 

10 

The  Morning Post,  of  course,  is  still  more  warlike,  and  gives  its  readers 

to  understand  that  the  "untoward"  event  at  Sinope  could  never  have  oc 
curred  if  Lord  Palmerston  were  the  Premier,  or  at  least  the  Minister  for 
Foreign  Affairs. 

"It  is  at  least  evident,"  says  The Post,  "that  a  Russian  naval  force,  dis-  15 

patched  to  act  on  the  Turkish  coast,  has  been  able  to  strike  a  sudden  and 
heavy blow  at the resources  of  the Porte, precisely in the quarter where the 
Divan had the  best reason  to  expect that if there  were  anything  substantial, 
anything  beyond  mere  ostentation,  in  the  professed  services  of  her  allies, 
the value  and  operation of  such  services  might now be  expected to  become  20 
available.  It  will  hardly  be  urged,  we  suppose,  that  the  Black  Sea  is  an 
appropriate  stage for another scene of the diplomatic comedy which has been 
played  in the  Principalities  under  the  name  of the  'Material Guarantee.' The 
Russians,  therefore,  may  be  taken  to have abandoned the hypocrisy of their 
defensive attitude. It must be a subject of deep regret, that the extent to which 
our (read Aberdeen's)  soothing  policy  has  gone,  has  brought heavy  damage 
on  our  ally  and  a  shadow  of  reproach on ourselves.  It would  be  a matter  of 
lasting blame and  scandal,  should  a second such disaster be suffered to occur 
for  want  of,  that  protection  which  our  fleets  were  expressly  dispatched  to 
afford." 

25 

30 

The  philosophical  Morning  Chronicle,  the  special  organ  of  the  Peelites, 
thinks  "it  not  improbable  that  the  power  which  has  disturbed  the  peace  of 
the  world  may nowbe disposed to acquiesce in the termination of the war." 

The  Emperor  Nicholas,  on the  plea that "he  does  not  wish to  oppose the 

expression  of  the  free  will"  of  the  Hospodar  s  Stirbey  and  Ghika  to  withdraw  35 
from the  government  of  Moldavia  and Wallachia, has, by rescript of Nov. 8, 
intrusted  their  functions  to  General  von  Budberg,  placed,  however,  under 
the  superior  control  of  Prince  Gorchakoff. 

The  fact  of  England  urging  upon Turkey  an  armistice  at  a moment when 
it  cannot  but  assist  the  Czar  in gaining time  to  concentrate  his  troops  and  40 
to  work at the  decomposition  of  the  ostensible  alliance between France and 

558 

The  Russian  Victory—Position  of  England  and  France 

England;  the  simultaneous  intrigues  of  Nicholas  to  upset  Bonaparte  and to 
replace him by Henry V. ; the loudly boasted-of "fusion" of the two Bourbon 
branches  negotiated  in  common  by  King  Leopold,  Prince  Albert  and  the 
Princes  of  Orléans—such  are  the  circumstances  which induce  the public to 
direct  anew  their  attention  to  Windsor  Castle,  and  to  suspect  it of a  secret 
conspiracy  with  the  courts  of  Brussels,  Vienna  and  St. Petersburg. 

"The  present  race  of  Englishmen,"  says  the  aristocratic  Morning Herald, 
"should  see  that  the  pohcy  of  this  country  be  not  made  subordinate  to 
Orleanistic  dreams  of  restoration,  Belgian  terrors  of  annexation,  and  in-
finitesimal  German  interests."  "There  are,"  insinuates  Lloyd's  Weekly 
Newspaper,  "conspirators  not  watched  by  the  Home  Office—conspirators 
whose  names,  like  stars  upon  a  frosty  night—glitter  in  The  Court  Circular. 
They do not live in St. John's Wood, neither dwell they in Chelsea. No. They 
enjoy  a somewhat larger accommodation in the  Halls  of  Claremont.  One of 
those  conspirators—the  frequent  guest  of  our  gracious  Queen—called  by 
comphment  the  Duke  of  Nemours,  went  fresh  from  his  English  home  to 
Frohsdorf  to  make  that bridge—that is,  to  bridge the  abyss for the Bourbons 
back  to  France.  And  doubtless  he  will  return  and  again  eat  his  venison  at 
Buckingham  Palace  or Windsor  Castle."  "Your ministers," writes  the  Paris 
correspondent  of  The  Leader,  "are  doing  what  Victoria  tells  them  to  do. 
Queen  Victoria  wishes  all that King Leopold wishes.  King Leopold desires 
all  that  Emperor  Nicholas  desires,  so  that  Nicholas  is  de  facto  the present 
King  of  England." 

The position of Bonaparte is  at this moment more critical than ever before, 
although, at first view, his chances of fortune never seemed more promising. 
He has succeeded in slipping into the circle of European royalty. The charac 
ter  Nicholas  has  lost, he has  won.  For the first time in his life he has become 
"respectable."  The  power which,  combined with Russia,  tumbled  down his 
uncle  from  his  gigantic  throne,  England,  has  been  forced  into  an  apparent 
alliance with himself against Russia. Circumstances have almost constituted 
him  the  arbiter of Europe.  The  prospect of  a European war,  dragging  along 
with  it insurrectionary movements  in  Italy,  Hungary, and Poland-countries 
where the people looking almost exclusively to the  recovery of their national 
independence,  are  by  no  means  too  scrupulous as to the quarter from which 
to  receive  assistance—these  eventualities  seem  to  allow the  man  of  the  2d 
of  December  to  lead  the  dance  of  the  peoples,  if  he  should  fail to play the 
pacificator  with the  kings.  The  enormous  blunders  committed by his prede 
cessors  have  given  his  policy  even  the  appearance  of  national vigor,  as  he, 
at  least,  evokes  apprehensions  on  the  part  of  the  powers, while they,  from 
the  Provisional  Government  down  to  the  Burgraves  of  the  Assemblée 
Législative,  had  assumed  only the power to tremble  at everything and every 
body.

But  now  let us  look  at the  opposite  side of the medal.  The fusion between 
the  two  branches  of  the  Bourbon  dynasty,  whatever  may  be  its  mtrinsic 
value,  has  taken  place  under  the  auspices  of  the  Courts  of  London  and 
Vienna,  and at the  dictation of the  Emperor Nicholas.  It is,  therefore, to be 
considered  as the first act of a Holy Alliance directed against Bonaparte. On 
the  other hand it has, for the moment, conciliated the different parties of the 
French  Bourgeoisie,  whose  very  divisions  prevented  them  in  1848-51  from 
opposing  the  usurpation  of  the  hero  of  Strasburg  and  Boulogne.  The  blue 
Republicans themselves, meeting  at the house  of  Mr.Carnot, have decided, 
almost unanimously, that they would lend their  aid to the Legitimists in any  10 
attempt  to  overthrow  Bonaparte.  These  gentlemen  seem  fully  resolved  to 
run again through the traditionary cycles of restoration, Bourgeois-monarchy 
and  Republic.  For  them  the  Republic  meant never  anything but,  "ôte-toi de 
là,  que je  m'y mette, " and  if  they  cannot  take  themselves,  the  place  of their 
rival,  they  will  at  least  inflict  upon  him  the  greatest  punishment  they  are  15 
aware  of—the  loss  of  place.  The  parts  to  be  acted  have  already  been  dis 
tributed.  The  generals,  the  ministers,  all  the  principal functionaries  are  al 
ready  nominated.  The  danger  threatening  Bonaparte  from  this  side  is  a 
military  insurrection which,  if  it  do  not lead to  the restoration of the  Bour 
bons, may afford the occasion for a general outbreak. But after all this Mallet 20 
conspiracy, dependant on the  support of the Cossacks, is no more dangerous 
than  the  Ledm-Rollin  conspiracy,  dependant  on  the  support  of  the  Turks. 
Let  me  remark,  en passant,  that  if  the  whole  French  emigration at London 
and  Jersey  were  to  meet.  Ledru  would  hardly  venture  to  present  himself. 
The  great  majority  of  the  French  refugees  belonging  to  different fractions 
of  the  socialist  party,  have  joined  together  in  the  Société  des  Proscrits 
Démocrates  et  Socialistes,  avowedly hostile to the pretentions of Ledru.  He 
is  said to  possess  still  some  influence  with the  French peasantry, but power 
must be  conquered, not in the  departments, but at Paris, and at Paris he will 
meet with a resistance  he is  not the  man to  overcome. 

30 

25 

The  serious dangers to be apprehended on the part of Bonaparte rise from 
quite  a different quarter, viz.:  from the high prices of provisions, the  stagna 
tion  of  trade,  and  the  utter  dilapidation  and  exhaustion  of  the  Imperial 
exchequer. It was the peasantry who, in their  superstitious faith in the  magic 
powers  of  the  name of  "Napoleon,"  and in the  golden promises  held out by  35 
the hero of Strasburg, first imposed him on France.  For them the restoration 
of  the  Bonaparte  dynasty  was  the  restoration  of their own supremacy, after 
they had  been  abused  by  the  restoration,  speculated  upon by the  monarchy 
of  July,  and  made by the  Republic to  pay the  expenses  of the revolution of 
February.  They are  now disabused,  not only by dragonnades but by famine  40 
too. Incendiarism spreads, at this moment, through France at an unparalleled 

560

pace.  As  to  the  middle  classes,  they  were  foolish  enough  to  suspect  the 
Assemblée  Nationale  of  having caused,  by the  disputes  and intrigues  going 
on  among  its  different  fractions,  and  by  their  common  opposition  to  the 
executive  power,  the  transitory  commercial  stagnation  of  1851.  They  de-
serted  not  only  their  own  representatives,  but  they  provoked  intentionaUy 
the  coup  d'état with  a  view  to  restore  what  they  called  "a  regular  Govern 
ment,"  and  above  all,  "sound  business."  They  have  now  discovered  that 
industrial  crises  are  neither  to  be  prevented  by  military  despotism  nor  al 
leviated  by  its  stretching  public  credit to  its  utmost hmits,  exhausting it by 
the  most  lavish  expenditure,  and  making the  financial  crisis  the  inevitable 
partner  of  a  commercial  one.  The  middle  class  pine,  therefore,  for  a  new 
change  of  power,  to  afford  them  at last  "a regular Government" and  "sound 
business."  As  to  the  proletarians,  they  accepted  Bonaparte  from the  first 
moment  only  as  a  transitory  necessity,  as  the  destroyer  of  the  république 
cosaque,  and  their  avenger  on  the  party  of order.  Weakened  as  they  were 
by successive defeats before the 2d of December, and fuUy occupied as they 
were  during the years  1852  and  1853, they have had time to watch the occa 
sion  when  general  causes  and  the  universal  discontent  of  ah  other  classes 
would  enable  them  to  resume  their  revolutionary  work  anew.

The following Paris  commercial report will throw  some light on the social 

state  of  France: 

25 

"The  state  of  commercial  affairs  in  Paris  during  the  last  week  is  not 
satisfactory.  Except  the  manufacturers  who  are  preparing  New-Years 
presents  for  the  shop-keepers,  and  those  employed  in  dress-making,  trade 
appears to be at a complete stand-still. One great cause of this is the dearness 
of  provisions  in  the  provinces,  which  prevents  the  mass  of  the  population 
from  making  their  usual  purchases.  The wheat crop,  the  chestnuts, and  the 
vintage  failed  simultaneously  in the  central departments  of  France,  and  the 
peasants,  being  compelled to  make  sacrifices  in order to buy bread, deprive 
30 themselves of every thing but articles of f irst necessity. The provincial letters 
state  that  the  principal  portion  of  the  cotton  goods  offered  for  sale  at  the 
late  fairs  found  no  buyers,  which easily  accounts  for  the  stagnation in trade 
apparent  at  Rouen.  AU  exportation  is  confined  at  present  to  the  South 
American  States.  The  markets  of  New-York  and  New-Orleans  are  repre-
sented  as  glutted  with  French  produce,  and  consequently  no  orders  are 
expected  from  those  quarters.  The  houses  which  fabricate  generally' for 
Belgium and Germany have almost all suspended their works, all orders from 
their  correspondents  abroad  having  ceased.  Business  must  be  duU  in Paris 
when  the  Bank  of  France  finds,  as  it  does  at  present,  the  commercial büls 
40  offered  for  discount  decrease  considerably  in  amount.  The  corn  market, 
which  was  duU ten days  since, with declining prices,  has become  animated, 

35 

561

and the holders of wheat are more firm in their banks. The bakers have shown 
a  greater  inclination to  purchase  flour,  and  several buyers  from  the  eastern 
departments  have  definitively  arrested  the  downward  tendency  of  prices. 
The  corn  factors  in  Paris  not being  able  to  execute  all  the  orders  received 
on  Wednesday  last,  the  buyers  proceeded to  Havre, where  a decline  of 2f. 
a  barrel  had  previously  been  announced.  Flour  immediately  on  the  arrival 
of the buyers  rose from 44 f.  to 47 f.  the barrel,  and wheat from 83 f.  to 86 f. 
the  measure  of  200 kilogrammes.  A  similar  rise  took place  in  the  markets 
through the department of the North. The corn market at Strasbourg has been 
well supplied, and wheat has declined 1 f. the hectolitre ; at Lyons the market 1 o 
was quiet, but without a fall. Rye has again risen in Paris ; sales 12,000 quintals 
of  oats  at  22 f.  9 c.  the  100 kilogrammes.  A  letter  from  Marseilles  of the  2d 
inst.,  states that 341  ships, bearing 804,270 hectolitres of wheat, entered that 
port  between  the  1st  and  30th  of  November.  These  arrivals  make 
2,102,467 hectolitres  of wheat imported into  Marseilles by 714  ships, within  15 
the  last 4 months."

Palmerston's  Resignation

Palmerston's  Resignation. 

The  most  interesting  and  important  piece  of  intelligence  brought  by  the 
steamer  Africa  is  the  resignation  of  Lord  Palmerston  as  a  member  of  the 
Coalition  Ministry  under  Lord  Aberdeen.  This  is  a  master-stroke  of  that 
5  unscrupulous  and consummate  tactician.  Those  journals  at London, which 
speak  for  the  Ministry,  carefully  inform  the  public  that  the  event  does  not 
grow  out  of the  Eastern  difficulty,  but that his  conscientious  Lordship,  like 
a  true  guardian  of  the  British  Constitution,  quits  office  because  he  cannot 
give  his  consent  to  a  measure  of  Parliamentary  Reform,  even  of the  pigmy 
10  dimensions  natural  to  such  a Whig  as  Lord  John  Russell.  Such  is,  indeed, 
the  official  motive  of  resignation  he  has  condescended  to  communicate  to 
his  colleagues  of  the  Coalition.  But  he  has  taken  good  care  that  the  public 
shall  have  a  different  impression  and  in  spite  of  all  the  declarations  of the 
official  organs,  it  is  generally  believed  that  while  the  Reform  B ui  is  the 
15  pretext,  the  Russian policy  of  the  Cabinet  is  the  real cause.  Such has been 
for  some time, and especially since the close of the last session of Parliament, 
the tenor of all the journals in his interest.  On various keys, and in multiform 
styles, they have played a single tune, representing Lord Palmerston as vainly 
struggling  against  the  influence of the Premier, and revolting at the ignomin-
ious  part  forced  upon  him  in  the  Eastern  drama.  Rumors  have  been  in 
cessantly  circulated  concerning  the  division  of  the  Ministry  into  two  great 
parties,  and  nothing  has  been  omitted  to  prepare  the  British public  for  an 
exhibition  of  characteristic  energy  from  the  chivalrous  Viscount.  The 
comedy  having  been  thus  introduced,  the  mise  en scène arranged, the noble 
25  Lord,  placed behind the  curtain,  has chosen, with astonishing sagacity, the 
exact moment when his appearance on the  stage would be most startling and 
effective. 

20 

Lord  Palmerston  secedes  from  his  friends  of the  Coalition just as Austria 
has  eagerly  seized  the  proposition  for  new  conferences;  just as  the  Czar is 

563 

Karl Marx

spreading  wider  his  nets  of  intrigue  and  war,  effecting  an  armed  collision 
between  the  Servians  and  Bosnians,  and  threatening  the  reigning prince  of 
Servia with deposition  should  he  persist in remaining neutral in the conflict; 
just  as  the  Turks,  relying  on  the  presence  of the  British and  French  fleets, 
have  suffered the  destruction of  a flotilla and  the  slaughter of 5,000 men by 
a Russian fleet three times  as powerful;  when Russian captains  are allowed 
to  defy the British law  in British ports, and on board of British vessels ; when 
the  dynastic  intrigues  of  the  "spotless  Queen"  and  her "German  Consort" 
have  become  matters  of  public  notoriety;  and, lastly, when the  dull British 
people, injured in their national pride abroad, and tortured by strikes, famine, 1 o 
and  commercial  stagnation at home, begin to  assume  a threatening attitude, 
and  have  nobody  upon  whom  to  avenge  themselves  but  their  own  pitiful 
Government.  By retiring  at  such a moment,  Lord  Palmerston throws  off  all 
responsibility  from  his  own  shoulders  upon  those  of  his  late  partners.  His 
act  becomes  a  great  national  event.  He  is  transformed  at  once  into  the  15 
representative  of the people against the  Government from which he secedes. 
He  not  only  saves  his  own  popularity,  but  he  gives  the  last  finish  to  the 
unpopularity  of  his  colleagues.  The  inevitable  downfall  of  the  present 
Ministry  appearing  to  be  his work, he becomes  a necessary element of  any 
that  may  succeed it.  He not only deserts  a doomed Cabinet, but he imposes  20 
himself  on  its  successor. 

Besides  saving  his  popularity  and  securing  a  prominent place in the  new 
administration,  Lord  Palmerston  directly  benefits  the  cause  of  Russia,  by 
withdrawing  at  the  present  momentous  crisis.  The  Coalition  Cabinet,  at 
whose  procrastinating  ingenuity  Russian  diplomacy  has  mocked,  whose  25 
Orleanist and  Coburg predilections have ever been suspected by Bonaparte, 
whose  treacherous  and  pusillanimous  weakness  begins  even  to  be  under 
stood  at  Constantinople—this  Ministry  will  now  lose what little  influence  it 
may have  retained in the councils of the world.  An administration disunited, 
unpopular,  not  relied  upon  by  its  friends,  nor  respected  by  its  foes;  con-  30 
sidered  as  merely  provisional,  and  on  the  eve  of  dissolution;  whose  very 
existence  has  become  a matter  of  doubt—such  an  administration is  the least 
adapted  to  make  the  weight  of  Great  Britain  felt  in  the  balance  of  the 
European  powers.  Lord Palmerston's withdrawal reduces the Coalition, and 
with it England herself, to a nullity as far as foreign policy is concerned; and  35 
never  has  there  existed  an  epoch when the  disappearance  of  England from 
the  public  stage,  even for  a  week  or  a  fortnight,  could  do  so  much  for  the 
Autocrat.  The  pacific  element  has  triumphed  over  the  warlike  one  in  the 
councils  of  Great  Britain.  Such  is  the  interpretation  that  must  be  given  at 
the courts  of Berlin, Paris and Vienna to Lord Palmerston's resignation; and  40 
this  interpretation  they  will  press  upon  the  Divan,  already  shaken  in  its 

564 

M 

Palmerston's  Resignation 

self-confidence  by  the  last  success  of Russia, and consulting under the guns 
of  the  united  fleet. 

It  should  not  be  forgotten  that  since  Lord  Palmerston became  a member 
of the Coalition Ministry, his public acts, as far as foreign policy is concerned, 
5  have  been  limited  to  the  famous  gun-powder  plot,  and  the  avowed  em 
ployment  of  the  British  police  as  spies  against  the  political  refugees;  to  a 
speech wherein  he  jocosely treated  the  obstruction by Russia of the naviga 
tion  of  the  Danube  as  of  no  account;  and,  lastly, to the  oration with which 
he dismissed Parliament, assuring the Commons that all the Government had 
10  done  in  the  Eastern  complication  had  been  right—that  they  might  quietly 
disband  since the ministers remained at their posts, and pledging himself "for 
the  honor  and  good  faith  of  the  Emperor  of  Russia." 

Besides  the  general causes we  have enumerated, Lord Palmerston has had 
a  special  reason  for  surprising the  world  with this  last  act of self-sacrificing 
15  patriotism.  He has been found out.  His prestige has begun to wane, his past 
career  to  be  known to the  public.  The  people  of  England  who  had not been 
undeceived  by  his  avowed  participation  in  the  conspiracy  of  the  2d  of 
December,  which  overthrew  the  French  Repubhc,  and  by  bis  gunpowder 
comedy,  have  been  aroused  by  the  revelations  of  Mr. D a v id  U r q u h a r t, 
20 who has vigorously taken his Lordship in hand. This gentleman, by a recently 
published  work  called  the  Progress  of  Russia,  by  articles  in  the  English 
journals,  and  especially  by  speeches  at  the  anti-Russian  meetings  held 
throughout the  Kingdom, has  struck a blow at the political reputation of Lord 
Palmerston  which  future  history  will  but  confirm.  Our  own  labors  in  the 
cause  of  historical  justice  have  also  had  a  share,  which we  were  far  from 
counting upon,  in the  formation of  a new  opinion in  England with regard to 
this  busy  and  wily  statesman.  We  learn from  London,  quite unexpectedly, 
that  Mr. Tucker has reprinted there and gratuitously circulated fifty thousand 
copies  of an elaborate  article  in which,  some two months since, we exposed 
30  his  Lordship's  true  character  and  dragged the  mask from his  public career. 
The change in public feeling is not a pleasing one for its subject, and he thinks 
perhaps,  to  escape  from the rising tide  of  reprehension,  or to  suppress  it by 
his  present  coup.  We predict that it will not succeed, and that his lengthened 
career  of  official  life  will  ere  long  come  to  a  barren  and  unhappy  end.

Progress  of the Turkish War. 

After  a long delay we are at last in po ssession of official documents in relation 
to the two victories which Russia so loudly boasts of and so liberally rewards. 
We  allude,  of  course,  to  the  destruction of the Turkish  squadron at Sinope 
and the engagement near Akaltzik, in Asia. These documents are the Russian 
bulletins;  but  the  fact  that  the  Turkish  official  organ  has  maintained  a 
profound  silence  on  the  subject,  when  its  communications,  if it had any to 
make  should  have  reached  us  before  those  from  St. Petersburg,  makes  it 
certain  that  the  Porte  has  nothing  agreeable  to  publish.  Accordingly  we 
proceed,  on  the  information we  have,  to  analyze  the  events in question, in  10 
order  to  make  our  readers  acquainted  with  the  real  state  of  the  case: 

5 

The  battle  of  Sinope  was  the  result  of  such  an  unparalleled  series  of 
blunders  on the part of the Turks that the whole  affair can only be explained 
by  the  mischievous  interference  of  Western  diplomacy  or by collusion with 
the  Russians  of  some  parties  in  Constantinople connected with the French  15 
and  English Embassies. In November, the whole Turkish and Egyptian  fleet 
proceeded  to  the  Black  Sea,  in  order  to  draw  the  attention  of  the  Russian 
Admirals  from  an  expedition  sent  to  the  coast  of  the  Caucasus  in  order to 
land  supplies  of  arms  and  ammunition for the  insurgent  mountaineers.  The 
fleet  remained  eighteen  days  at  sea without  meeting  with  a  single  Russian  20 
man-of-war;  some  say  the  Russian  squadron  never  left  Sevastopol  during 
all  that  time,  whereby  the  expedition  to  the  Caucasus  was  enabled  to 
effect  its  object;  others  report  that,  being  well-informed  of  the  plans  of 
the  Turks,  it withdrew  eastward,  and merely watched the vessels conveying 
stores, which, in consequence, never reached the  Caucasian  shore, and had  25 
to  return  to  Sinope,  while  the  main  fleet  reentered  the  Bosphorus.  The 
great  amount  of  powder  on  board  the  Sinope  squadron,  which  caused  the 
explosion  of  several  of  them  at  a  comparatively  early  period  of  the  en 
gagement,  appears  to  be  a  proof  that  the  latter  version  is  correct. 

566 

Progress of the Turkish War · December 22,1853

Thus  seven  Turkish frigates,  two  steamers,  three  sloops, and one  or two 
smaller  ships, together with  some transports,  were  abandoned in the harbor 
of Sinope, which is little better than an open roadstead, formed by abay open 
towards  the  sea,  and  protected  by  a  few  neglected  and  ill-constructed bat-
teries,  the  best  of  which  was  a  castle  constructed  at  the  time  of the  Greek 
Emperors,  and  most  likely  before  artillery  was  known  in  Europe.  How  it 
happened  that  a  squadron  of  some  three  hundred  guns,  mostly  of  inferior 
caliber, was thus abandoned to the tender mercies of a fleet of three times its 
force  and  weight  of  metal,  at  that  point  of  the  Turkish  shore,  which  from 
its  proximity  to  Sevastopol,  is  most  exposed to a Russian attack, while the 
main  fleet  was  enjoying  the  tranquil  ripple  of  the  Bosphorus,  we  have  yet 
to  learn.  We  know  that  the  dangerous  position  of  this  squadron  was  well 
appreciated and warmly debated at head quarters; that the discordant voices 
of  Turkish,  French  and  British  admirals,  were  loudly  heard in the councils 
15  of  war,  and  that  the  ever-meddling  embassadors  were  there  also,  in  order 

10 

to  speak their  minds  upon  the  matter,  but  nothing  was  done. 

25 

In the mean time  it appears, according to  one  statement, that an Austrian 
steamer  reported  at  Sevastopol  the  position  of  the  squadron.  The  Russian 
official  report maintains  on the  contrary,  that Nachimoff  while  cruising off 
20 the coast of Asia, descried the squadron, and took measures to attack it. But, 
if  the  Russians  descried the Turks  at  Sinope,  the  Turks  from the tower  and 
minarets  of  the  town  must  necessarily  have  descried  the  Russians  long 
before.  How  then came  it to pass that the Turkish batteries were in such bad 
trim,  when  a couple  of days' labor might have done a great deal toward their 
repair?  How  happened  it  that the  Turkish  vessels  were at anchor in places 
where  they  obstructed  the  fire  of  the  batteries,  and  were  not  shifted  to 
moorings  more  fit  to  meet  the  threatened  danger?  There  was  time  enough 
for  all this;  for  Admiral Nachimoff  states that he first  sent to  Sevastopol for 
three  three-deckers  before  he  ventured  the  attack.  Six days, from  Novem-
30  ber  24  to  November  30,  would  not  have  been  allowed  to  elapse  without 
some  effort  on  the  part  of  the  Turks:  but indeed, the  report of  the Turkish 
steamer  Ta'if,  which  escaped  to  Constantinople,  amply  proves  that  the 
Turks  were  taken  by  surprise.  So  far,  then,  the  Russian  report  cannot  be 
correct. 

35 

Admiral  Nachimoff  had  under  his  command  three  ships-of-the-line,  one 
of them a three-decker,  six frigates, several steamers, and six or eight smaller 
vessels, a force of at least twice the weight of metal of the Turkish squadron. 
Yet he  did  not  attack until he got three more three-deckers, which, by them 
selves,  should  have  been  quite  sufficient  to  perform  the  exploit.  With  this 
40  disproportionate  superiority  he proceeded to the assault.  A fog,  or as  some 
say,  the  use  of  the  British  flag,  enabled  him  to  approach  unmolested  to  a 

567 

Friedrich  Engels 

distance of 500 yards.  Then the fight began. The Russians, not liking to stand 
under  canvas  on a lee shore, dropped their anchors. Then the firing from the 
two  moored  fleets,  without  any  naval  maneuvers,  and  having  rather  the 
character  of  a  cannonade  on  shore,  went on for four  hours.  The  possibility 
of  doing away with all naval tactics, with all movements, was very favorable 
to  the  Russians,  whose  Black  Sea  fleet,  manned  almost  exclusively  with 
"land-lubbers,"  and  especially  with  Polish Jews,  might have had very poor 
success  if  opposed  to  the  well-manned  Turkish  ships  in  deep  water  .  Four 
hours  were  required  by  the  Russians  before  they  could  silence  the  feeble 
ships  of  their  opponents.  They had,  besides,  this  advantage, that any  stray  10 
shot  on  their  part  would  do  harm either in the batteries  or in the town,  and 
what  a  number  of  misses,  in  comparison  to  the  hits  they  must  have  made, 
appears  from  the  almost  total  destruction  of  the  place,  accomplished  long 
before  the  hostile  fleet  was  silenced.  The  Russian  report  says  only  the 
Turkish  quarter  was  burnt  down,  and  that  the  Greek  quarter  escaped  as  if  15 
by miracle.  This  is, however,  contradicted by better  authority, which states 
that  the  whole  town  is  in  ruins. 

5 

Three  Turkish frigates  were  burnt during the  action, four were run ashore 
and burnt  afterwards,  along  with  one  steamer  and the  smaller vessels.  The 
steamer  Tai'f,  however,  cut her  cables, boldly  steamed  through the Russian  20 
lines, and escaped to Constantinople, although chased by Admiral Kornilof f 
with  three  Russian  steamers.  Considering  the  clumsiness  of  Russian  naval 
maneuvers,  the  bad  position  of  the Turkish fleet in front,  and in the line  of 
fire,  of 
their  own  batteries,  and  above  all  the  absolute  certainty  of 
destruction, it would have perhaps been better if the whole Turkish squadron 
had  got under  weigh and  borne  down as  far  as  the  wind permitted  upon the 
enemy.  The ruin of  some,  which could by no  means be avoided, might have 
saved  at least  a portion of  the  squadron.  Of course the direction of the wind 
must  have  decided  as  to  such  a  maneuver,  but  it  seems  doubtful  whether 
Osman Pasha ever  thought of  such a  step  at all. 

25

The victory of Sinope has no glory for the Russians, while the Turks fought 
with almost unheard of bravery; not a single ship having struckits flag during 
the  whole  action.  And  this  loss  of  a  valuable  portion  of  their  naval  force, 
the  momentary  conquest  of  the  Black  Sea,  and  the  dejecting  moral  con 
sequences  of  such  an  event upon  the  Turkish population,  army  and  navy,  35 
is  entirely due to the "good offices" of Western diplomacy, which prevented 
the  Turkish  fleet  from  standing  out  and  protecting  or  fetching  home  the 
Sinope  squadron.  And it is equally due to the  secret information given to the 
Russians  enabling  them  to  strike  the  blow  with  certainty  and  safety. 

The  second  victory  of  which  the  Russians  boast,  came  off  at Akhaltzik,  40 

in Armenia. The Turks have for some time past been checked in the offensive 

568 

Progress of the Turkish War · December 22, 1853 

movements  which  they  had  effected  on  the  Georgian  frontier.  Since  the 
taking  of  Shef  katil,  or  St.  Nicolas,  not  a  place  of  any  importance  has  been 
taken,  nor  any  victory  gained  of  more  than  ephemeral  effect.  And  this  in  a 
country  where  the  Russians  must fight under  all imaginable  disadvantages, 
5  where  their  land  communications  with  Russia  are  reduced  to  two  roads 
infested  by  insurgent  Circassians,  where  their  sea  communications  might 
very  easily  be  cut off  or endangered,  and where  the Transcaucasian country 
occupied by  them,  with Tiflis  for its  centre,  might be considered more  as  an 
independent  State,  than  as  part  and  parcel  of  a mighty empire.  How  is  this 
1 o check of the Turkish advance to be explained? The Turks accuse Abdi Pasha 
of  treason  and  have  recalled  him;  and  certainly it is  very curious that Abdi 
Pasha  is  the  only  Turkish  General  in  Asia,  who  has  been  allowed  by  the 
,  Russians  to  gain local  and  partial  victories.  But  there  are  two  mistakes  on 
the  part of the  Turks which explain the want of success in the beginning and 
15 the actual defeat in due course afterward. They have spread and divided then-
army upon all the long une from Batum to Bayazid; their masses are nowhere 
strong  enough  for  a  concentric  attack  upon  Tiflis,  though  part  of them  are 
at  the  present  moment,  enjoying  the  undisputed  and  useless  possession  of 
the  city  of  Erivan.  The  country is barren and rocky,  and it may be  difficult 
20 to feed a large army there ; but quick concentration of all resources and rapid 
movements  are  the  best  means  against  famine  in  an  army.  Two  corps, one 
for  covering  Batum  and  attacking  on  the  coast-line,  another  for  a  direct 
march  upon Tiflis  through  the  valley of the  Kur would have been  sufficient. 
But the Turkish forces have been divided and  subdivided without any neces-
sity whatever, and to the almost entire disabling of every one of the different 
corps. 

25 

In  the  second  place,  the  inactivity  in  which  diplomacy  held  the  Turkish 
fleet  allowed the Russians to land two divisions of infantry (of the 5th corps) 
in  Mingrelia,  and  thus  to  re-enforce  Prince  Woronzoff's Caucasian army by 
30  nearly 20,000 men.  Thus  strengthened, he not only arrested the Turks of the 
coast, but has  now  had  the  satisfaction of  seeing a corps under Gen. Andro-
nikoff  deliver  the  beleaguered  fortress  of  Akhaltzik,  and  beat the  enemy on 
the  open  field  near  that  town.  The  Russians  pretend  that  with  about 
10,000 men  they  have  routed  18,000 Turks;  of  course  we  cannot  rely  upon 
such statements; but must confess  that the  great number of irregulars in the 
Turkish  Anatolian army  and the  almost total  absence  of  European officers, 
particularly  in  the  higher  commands  and  on  the  staff,  must make  them  but 
a  poor  match  for  an  equal  number  of Russians.  The  Russians  pretend  they 
have  taken  ten  or  twelve  pieces  of  cannon,  which  may  be  true,  as  in  that 
impassable  country the vanquished party must necessarily abandon most of 
its  guns;  at  the  same  time  they confess  they have  made  only  120 prisoners. 

40 

35 

569 

Friedrich  Engels 

This  amounts  to  a  confession  that  they  have  massacred  almost  all  the 
wounded  on  the  field  of  battle,  they  being  necessarily  left  in  their  hands. 
Besides,  they  prove  that  their  measures  for  pursuit  and  intercepting  the 
retreat  of  at  least  part  of  the  enemy,  must  have  been  wretchedly  planned. 
They  had  plenty  of  cavalry;  a  bold  charge  into  the  midst  of  the  fugitives 
would  have  cut  off  whole  battalions.  But  this  action  offers,  so  far  as  our 
reports  go,  but  little  military  or  political  interest. 

On the Danube, the Russians have done nothing more than repeat the affan-
by  which they  opened  the  campaign,  at Matchin,  a fort, on a projecting rock 
opposite  Braila.  They  appear to  have  made little  impression.  We  have  also, 
on  good  authority,  a  detailed  statement  of the  Turkish troops  concentrated 
at Widdin. They consist of 34,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry, and 2,000 artillery, 
with 66 field-guns, besides heavy artillery on the walls of Widdin,  and on the 
redoubts  of  Kalafat.  Thus,  40,000 Turks  are  wasted  in  order to  occupy the 
direct route  from Bucharest into  Servia.  Forty thousand men, chained down 
to  extensive  fortifications  which  they  have  to  defend,  are  too  few  to  with 
stand the  attack of  a large  army,  and  a great  deal too  many  to  defeat roving 
expeditions of small bodies. With the force already collected at Shumla, these 
40,000  men  would  there  be  worth  twice  their  number  elsewhere.  Their  ab 
sence,  next  to  diplomatic interference, ruined the  operation of  Oltenitza.  It 
is  impossible  that  Omer  Pasha  should  not  know,  that  if  he  stands  with 
100,000 men between Silistria and Rustchuk, the Russians, in numbers  suffi 
cient  to  do  mischief,  will  never  attempt  to  pass  by  him  in  order  to  throw 
themselves  into  the  mountains  of  Servia.  Such  a  disposition  of  his  troops 
cannot  accord  with  his  judgment,  and  he  must  chafe  desperately  at  the 
maleficent  influences  which  force  it  upon  him.

The  Storm's  First  Thunder

The first thunder of the coming storm has rolled in Italy, smothered in a rain of blood, 
or echoing only within  dungeon walls—it has passed  away—and the marked victims 
of popular  and  national  vengeance,  saved  this once, exclaim:  "Quiet is restored!" 
It is.  The ominous  and dreadful quiet that intervenes between the first burst of the 
tempest  and  its  returning roar.  This  transient outbreak of  the  prostrate giant, this 
heaving  of  Enceladus  beneath  his  burning  mountain,  is  a  terrible  warning  to the 
oppressors of the world. At one electric touch,  at one  voice, at one cry of "Rise!" 
though issued from a distance of near  a thousand miles,  all Italy thrills  and  moves 
from  end  to end. Napoleon trembles on his bridal throne, and multiplies arrests in 
Paris;  a dangerous movement runs through the very ranks of Austria's armies—and 
the thrones  of Europe  vibrate to their foundations beneath an unseen blow. Verily! 
there is  hope for Italy  and the world. 

Fellow  countrymen!  The  facts  of  this  noble  rising  will  be  distorted—are  being 
15  distorted by that vilest of  all party panders, the British Press.  Every calumny will 
be heaped upon it, and the chartered purveyors of lies, the class papers, will vie with 
each other to turn it into ridicule, or cover it with obloquy.  Let us, therefore, give 
you a succinct account, from the fountainhead, of this, the noblest act of unhesitating 
heroism in the  modern  world. 

20  Milan, the vast and splendid capital of Lombardy, a fortified town—coerced by a 
powerful citadel, is garrisoned and surrounded by forty thousand Austrian soldiers, 
whose stern disciplined masses can be brought simultaneously to bear on any given 
point.  A  terrible  artillery  is  housed  in  its  citadel—that  domineers  over  an utterly 
disarmed  city.  Not  a  musket  or  a  pike  was  to  be  found  in  the  possession  of  the 
25  Milanese. Based in this force, Austria hung, whipped, imprisoned, and murdered its 
countless  victims,  and  that terrible tyranny marched on through a deluge  of blood 
and tears, in a course of slaughter, bigotry, and persecution that has astounded the 
modern  world,  and even called forth the  sympathy and protests  of Prussian Kings 
and British aristocrats—the last people on the earth likely to help the oppressed. In 
the  midst  of  all  this,  two  vile  and  degenerate  classes—the  Italian aristocracy  and 
bourgeoisie—bowed their bare necks unmurmuring to the yoke—the former content 
if they could kick their heels as the lacqueys of lacqueys in the palaces of old Lombard 

30

princes now held by Austrian slaves, the latter, if they could traffic, and plunder the 
native, or cheat the English and French fools who passed squandering through their 
towns.  Not  so  the  working  men—the  proletarians  from whom,  and through whom 
alone, the hope  and liberation of the world can come.  The word having been given 
by  Mazzini  in  England,  who thought that the  Montenegrin war by drawing off the 
Austrian forces,  afforded  a favourable opportunity; that the Protestant persecution 
in  Sardinia  would  predispose  the  Piedmontese,  and  that  the  terrible  excitement 
occasioned by a successful revolt in Italy would prevent Napoleon from stirring with 
his  army  from  Paris—while  the  consecutive  explosion of Hungary would intercept 
Russian invasion, and distract Austrian power—the word having been given—up rose 10 
the glorious working men of Milan and Monza, unhesitating, self-devoted, and heroic. 
Alas! the leaders miscalculated sadly: Montenegro had just drawn 200,000 Russians 
on  the  Turco-Hungarian  frontier—all  ready  to  coerce  Hungary,  and  sufficient  to 
prevent  a  rising.  This  anticipated  rupture  with  France,  had  just  caused  Austrian 
armaments to concentrate in the south-west; and liberal religious concessions already 15 
made,  and more  promised, in  Sardinia,  had  disarmed  the  indignation of  the  Pied 
montese. No occasion could have been more inopportune. But what cared the noble 
working men of Lombardy. Their leaders told them to rise—and they rose like  flame 
from a volcano!  And  against what odds! 

5 

There spread the glorious city, in the pride of the carnival. The rich were revelling 20 

in the smile of their Austrian masters—the rich nobles and merchants, who welcome 
their German tyrants, since it saves them from beholding the triumph of democracy 
which shall  sweep away their monopolies and splendours. The luxuries and parties 
of these bastard sons of Italy have long outraged the people—these knaves who joined 
the foreign murderer, in dancing and laughing over the graves of their own country-  25 
men.  Such was the indignation, that several of the  common newspaper  statements 
actually ascribe the insurrection to the anger of the starving poor at these festivities 
of the wealthy. One such report says:—"The principal object was to frighten the rich, 
because they gave so many balls, and La Scala (the theatre) is so much frequented. 
...  has  received  some  frightful  anonymous  letters, because he has given and is to  30 
give  some  grand  balls."  Fancy,  these  sons  of  Mammon dancing and  singing and 
feasting  amid  the  blood  and  tears  of  their debased and  crucified nation!! 

That very night there was to be  a splendid ball at the Duchess of Visconti's, and 

another at a noble  club—that  of the  Marino. 

It was the 6th of February, a Sunday in the Carnival. The Austrian Government  35 

were aware that an explosion was about to take place, and were armed at all points. 
In the morning a rumour began to  spread, that at two there would be  a rising—but, 
there was a perfect calm in the city, and, owing to a heavy rain, fewer people in the 
streets  than usual.  The  patriots  themselves  suspected that their enemy was on his 
guard—but  the  word  had  been  given  from  the  exiles  in  England,  and  they  never  40 
wavered  for  a  moment.  At five  o'clock—a band of  50 men, were  seen marching in 
serried order, on the citadel. They were armed with nothing but long knives, all other 
arms  having  been  long  since  taken  away  by  the  Austrians,  so  complete  was  the 
disarmament of the people. Readers, I ask you to admire the heroism of these 50 men, 
who, armed only with knives, march to attack the citadel of a garrison and surrounding 45 

576 

The  Storm's  First Thunder 

army of 40,000 of the finest troops in Europe. They were working men. They rose 
at the call of their exiled chief for the salvation of their country, in the holiest cause 
that ever consecrated arms. These are designated by the "Times" and other papers— 
"a band of bad subjects, of the lowest grade of the city,"—and "alow rabble of ragged 
5  persons."  Shame  on  the  Press  that  dares  to  print  such  words,  so  applied,  in  its 
columns.  "The bourgeois  did not join,"  says  the  "Basle Gazette;" "the poordevus 
all belong to the labouring classes,"  says the "Parlamento." Yes! it was the people 
who rose for Italy, while the noble prepared his feasts, the priest blessed the murder 
er's bayonet, and the tradesman stood looking on, turning his money in his pocket, 

10  while his countrymen were being slaughtered before his eyes. 

15 

The little band marched on undismayed against the citadel, amid a general silence, 
broken only by the tolling of alarm bells, rung by the insurgents in three churches. 
The guard ran to arms, but, ere they could close the gate, the insurgents were already 
within,  and a dreadful  encounter ensued, between the well-armed-guard, and these 
few men armed only with short daggers.  Several Austrian officers and soldiers fell 
in the  struggle, but ere the  assailants could push on further to the place where the 
arms of the garrison were kept, the gates were closed before them, and behind, and 
they  died fighting  in  a long  heroic  struggle,  listening  with their last breath for the 
answering sounds of insurrection in the streets. There, another band of about thirty 
20  or forty,  threw themselves  against the  viceregal palace,  and here  also, they over 
powered  the  guard,  killing  officers  and  men—and  maintaining with  their wretched 
arms a terrible encounter, isolated in the stronghold of their foes, for upwards of an 
hour! Till the troops mustering, marched in their rear, and exterminated them by a 
cowardly fusillade. We have heard much and read much of feats of daring heroism, 
25  but  here  were  two  little  bands,  not  mustering  100 conjointly,  attacking,  in broad 
daylight, the two strongholds of an army of 40,000 men, throwing their lives on the 
hazard  of  the  die,  in the  hope  that the  noble  self-sacrifice would have roused the 
servile thousands of the capital to action, and lighten the beacon of revolution through 
Italy. But without, all remained  silent.  Except an isolated attack here and there on 
30 desultory guards, by detached portions of the little band of glorious conspirators, and 
the  gathering  of  slight  crowds  from  morbid  curiosity,  the  population  of  the  city 
remained  dead  and tame!  Either they misdoubted the truth of the proclamation of 
Mazzini calling on them  to rise, or that the latter had lost his influence and hold on 
the Italian people. Alas! that such heroes should be sacrificed in vain! Let them not 
35  call this heroism rashness; they obeyed the command of their leaders—and, indeed, 
it appears that, Aadthe masses risen, success would have been certain, temporarily, 
at least—for the Austrian press itself says :—"For one hour the military were paralysed, 
and had a general rising taken place, it would, in all probability, have proved success 
ful."  What caused the failure? The  Hungarian soldiers  were  summoned to revolt— 
the Italian people were ordered by Mazzini to rise—who assured the Milanese that 
the soldiers would go over and the rising be universal. Only two or three Grenadiers 
allowed  themselves to  be quietly disarmed.  The  reason of this  signal failure of the 
people, is, however, our Italian friends  assure us, not to be found in a decay of the 
Italian spirit, which is still as warm and true as ever. Perhaps had Kossuth appeared 
in person, the old enthusiasm would have kindled up, and with exultant Eljens the 

45 

40 

577 

Ernest Jones 

veterans  of  Komorn  and  Pesth would  have  rallied  around  the  ensign of universal 
freedom.  Perhaps,  if  Mazzini  or  Saffi had come down from their refuge in Bellin-
zona, confidence would have been given to the proletarians and sympathy awakened 
in the liberal portion of the middle class. But as it was, after the terrible experience 
of  '48  and  '49,  it  needed  something  more  than  paper  summonses  from  distant 
leaders  to  cause  the  men of  Milan once  again to  evoke  the  fires  of those terrible 
volcanoes,  that  in  the  form  of  citadel and forts  surrounded their once bombarded 
City of the Plains. 

5 

The difficulty of reaching the scene of action without being arrested midway, can 
form the only excuse for those who urged others to throw their lives upon the cast,  10 
not  risking  their  own.  Mazzini,  however,  went  as  near  as  perhaps  he  dared—he 
hovered  in the Italian confine, ready,  doubtlessly,  when the  sword had  shaken the 
strictness of Austrian cordons, to  plunge  into the centre of the conflict. 

But revolutions are never made to order—they are the spontaneous combustion of 

long  suffering,  smouldering below,  but breaking outward at the touch of accident,  15 
and triumphant only in the  combination of courage with favouring opportunities. 

We have thus  succinctly dwelt upon this great event, because we believe it to be 
the precursor of others far greater; because it has fully revealed the weakness of the 
European  tyrants:  one  hundred  men almost unarmed, drove  Giulay, the Governor 
General, in fright out of Milan, balanced the  military despotism for two hours, and  20 
terrified every crowned and mitred head in continental Europe—aye ! even sent a thrill 
of fear to the aristocratic reactionists in England; and, lastly, because of the insolent 
mis-representations  that  will  be  heaped  on  this  band  of  heroes.  They  are  called 
"assassins"  because  they  wield  daggers—the  last  weapons  left  them  by  Austrian 
disarmament—but the daggers were wielded in brave open fight, in broad day, against  25 
an armed foe, expecting (as the Austrian papers themselves tell us), their attack; they 
are called "rabble," "low" and "dissolute," because they are poor; they will be called 
plunderers and robbers, though not one outrage of the kind was perpetrated by them, 
because  they  sought to wrest their beautiful country from the robber and the plun 
derer.  But they are an advanced guard of the coming army of democracy, sent out  30 
too  early  and  too  unprepared,  to  fall  a  useless  sacrifice  for  their  great  cause, but 
indicating by  the very fact of their advance and death, that the vast host to which 
they belong, is silently but surely gathering up and marching on behind them. Honour 
to their memories, and glory to their effort! The shootings and hangings have begun 
already—the imprisonings and unknown murders—but history will dip her pen in their  35 
holy blood, when she  shall write the brightest passages of European liberation.

A  Pamphlet  on  the  "Revelations  Concerning  the  Trial 
of  the  Communists  at  Cologne" 

The  People's  Paper. 
Nr.47, 26. März 1853 
Our readers will probably remember the police infamies we revealed on the occasion 
of  the  Cologne  trials.  Dr. Marx has  issued  a pamphlet entitled,  "Revelations con 
cerning  the  trial  of  the  Communists  at  Cologne,"  in which he  exposes  the whole 
conspiracy  and  corruption  of  the  Prussian  Government  officials,  from  the  Crown 
5  Ministers to the lowest police agent, and the London embassy. This pamphlet was 
published  by  Mr.  Schabelitz in Basle. Two thousand copies of it have been seized 
on the  Baden frontier,  and burnt at the request of the Prussian Government. At the 
same time a state prosecution has been instituted against Schabelitz. How much the 
Prussian Government fears lest the public should know the contents of the pamphlet, 
is  evinced by  the fact that the  Minister for  Foreign Affairs in his circular-letter to 
the  Prussian authorities  has  given  it a false  name,  calling it  the  "Theory of Com 
munism." The pamphlet must be the more disagreeable to the Prussian Government, 
since the perjured Stieber, who was disclaimed by the Procurator himself, was hissed 
and hooted wherever he showed himself, has been rewarded for his services by being 
15  entrusted  with the  direction of the Berlin police. He is now the third power in the

Die  Arbeiteragitationen,  welche regelmäßig die Perioden der Prosperität begleiten, 
sind hier, wie in den Vereinigten Staaten, an der Tagesordnung, nur mit dem Unter 
schied,  daß man sich hier weit weniger, wie dort, auf die  Forderungen des Augen 
blicks beschränkt, sondern sich mit dem Bewußtsein ihrer Unzulänglichkeit für den 
ernsteren  Kampf  organisirt,  dessen  Ausbruch  unfehlbar  mit  dem  Aufhören  der 
Prosperität und dem Anbrechen der Krisis zusammenfällt. Die Forderungen höheren 
Arbeitslohnes  haben hier aber  eine Erscheinung hervorgerufen, welche eigenthüm-
lich  in  ihrer  Art  ist.  Trotz  der  dringenden  Anforderungen  des  Weltmarktes,  der 
Belebtheit des Handels, lassen verschiedene Fabrikanten nur „kurze Zerr" arbeiten, 10 
was  sonst nur in den Perioden der  Stockung geschieht.

„Die Lebhaftigkeit des Handels" — sagt darüber Ernest Jones in seinem „People's 
Paper" — „und die Auswanderung haben eine temporäre Verminderung des Arbeiter-
Ueberschusses  herbeigeführt, und  diese, in Verbindung mit der Preissteigerung der 
Lebensbedürfnisse hat die arbeitenden Klassen hier und dort zur Forderung höherer  15 
Löhne  getrieben.  Dieses  Kurze-Zeit-Arbeiten  ist  ein  Kniff,  um  einen  künstlichen 
Ueberschuß  zu schaffen und einen Entschuldigungsgrund für die Nichterhöhung der 
Löhne. Wahrlich, diese Baumwollen-Lords  sind unergründlich, wie die  See." 

Wollte  man  von  dieser  theilweisen  Arbeitsbeschränkung  auf  eine  Abnahme  der 
Spekulation  schließen,  würde  man  einen sehr falschen Schluß machen.  Besonders  20 
in  der  Baumwollen-Manufaktur  erreicht  dieselbe  im  Gegentheil  eine  Höhe,  daß 
Einem  fast  schwindlich wird,  während einzelne  Zweige  der Baumwollen-Industrie 
(grobe Zeuge, domestics) ganz darnieder liegen. Vor der Ueberspekulation glaubt sich 
die  Spekulation  dadurch  zu retten,  daß  sie  nur in Amerika und Frankreich (Eisen 
bahnen mit englischem Golde) en gros erscheint, hier sich aber ganz zerstückelt und  25 
gleichsam en detail zeigt, wodurch indessen weiter nichts erreicht wird, als daß der 
Schwindel  alle  Artikel infizirt.  — Der ganz abnorme Winter und die nicht weniger 
ungewöhnliche  Frühjahrswitterung müssen dem  Korn geschadet haben, und wenn, 
wie  es  meistentheils  der  Fall  ist,  noch  ein  abnormer  Sommer  folgt,  so  fallen  die 
Ernte-Aussichten vollständig in's Wasser. Es ist nichts weniger, als wahrscheinlich,  30 
daß  sich die gegenwärtige Prosperität über den Herbst hinaus halten sollte. 

Inzwischen blamirt sich seit zwölf Monaten jetzt das dritte englische Ministerium,

Steuer-Defizit sondern am Ueberschuß. Damit ist die ganze Politik der alten Parteien 
charakterisirt  und  zugleich  ihre  äußerste  Ohnmacht.  Wenn  die  jetzigen  Minister 
purzeln,  so kann England nicht mehr regiert werden ohne bedeutende Ausdehnung 
des legalen (d. i.  stimmfähigen) Landes, und dieses Ereigniß wird wahrscheinlich in 

5  den Beginn der Krisis fallen. 

Die  dauernde  Langeweile der Prosperität macht es dem unglücklichen Bonaparte 
fast unmöglich,  seine Würde zu behaupten;  die Welt ennuyirt sich und er ennuyirt 
sie. Leider kann er nicht alle vier Wochen von Neuem heirathen. Dieser Schwindler, 
Säufer und falsche  Spieler geht daran zu Grunde,  daß  er genöthigt ist,  zum Schein 
10  Engel's  „Fürstenspiegel" in Praxis zu setzen. Der Lumpacius als „Vater des Vater 
landes"! Den Gipfelpunkt seiner Größe hat er bereits hinter sich, ohne es zu etwas 
Großem gebracht zu haben; doch die Hauptsache ist, daß er nicht allein sich selbst 
prostituirt, daß sich in ihm alle die Klassen prostituiren, die sich unter seinen Schutz 
geflüchtet haben, die „alten Parteien", die ihre gesellschaftliche Suprematie nur noch 
15  durch den Dolch dieses Theaterprinzen und Meuchelmörders zu behaupten wußten. 

— Dabei kann er nicht einmal Krieg anfangen: bei der geringsten Bewegung seinerseits 
überall geschlossene  Glieder,  strotzend von  Bayonneten.  Dabei läßt die Ruhe den 
Bauern  eine  sehr  erwünschte  Zeit zum  Nachdenken,  wie  der  Mann,  der  Paris  zu 
Gunsten  der  Bauern  niederzudrücken  versprach,  jetzt  mit  dem  Gelde  der  Bauern 
20  Paris  verschönert,  und  wie  die  Hypotheken und  Steuern, trotz aller Finanzexperi 
mente, von denen nicht allein Bonapartisten, sondern selbst Sozialisten, wie Weitling 
u. Α.,  die Rettung der Welt erwarten, eher zu- als abnehmen. — Immerhin mag die 
Polizei  den  offenen  Manifestationen  der  Volksmeinung  entgegentreten,  wie  es 
Hr.  Maupas  nach  dem  Erscheinen  der  20  000  Proletarier  bei  dem Begräbnisse der 
25 Mad. Raspail gethan; immerhin mag sie die Colportage von Büchern und Broschüren 
unter  ihre besondere  Ueberwachung  stellen, um die  „Volksmoral" gegen verderb 
liche Einflüsse zu schützen, — die Verbreitung solcher Lehren, die aus den nackten 
Thatsachen  entspringen,  kann  sie  nicht  hindern, ohne in die Action der Regierung 
selbst einzugreifen.  Und wenn in dieser sonst keine Methode ist,  so ist wenigstens 

30  Methode darin, wie sie den Boden für die nächste Revolution vorbereitet.

In Preußen hat die Regierung sich die Bourgeoisie mit der Einkommenssteuer nicht 
übel  auf  den  Hals  gehetzt.  Einkommenssteuer  und  eine  feudal-bureaukratische 
Regierung!  Die  Steuerquoten  werden  von  den  Bureaukraten  mit  der  größten  Un 
verschämtheit  beliebig  erhöht,  und  mit  welcher  Wollust  diese  edlen  Federfuchser 
jetzt in den Handlungsgeheimnissen und  Geschäftsbüchern sämmtiicher Kaufleute 
herumwühlen,  davon mag sich Jeder leicht eine Vorstellung machen,  der glücklich 
genug war, diese Sorte preußischer Staatsdiener aus eigener Anschauung kennen zu 
lernen.  Selbst  die  stockpreußischsten  Geschäftsleute  schäumen vor  Wuth,  daß  sie 
die  Segnungen  des  konstitutionell-patriarchalisch-preußischen  gouvernement à bon 
40  marché so bis auf die Hefe durchkosten müssen. — Die preußische Staatsschuld, vor 
1848 circa 67 Millionen Thaler, muß seitdem auf das Vierfache angeschwollen sein, 
und schon wieder sind neue Anleiheprojekte im Schwünge. Der dicke König würde 
seine  Schweißtropfen aus  den Märztagen gewiß gern noch einmal schwitzen, wenn 
ihm  dieser  Credit  garantirt  würde  bis  an  sein  seliges  Ende.  Dabei  hat ihm  Louis 
45  Napoleon den  Zollverein wieder auf die Beine bringen helfen,  Oesterreich hat aus 

581

Furcht vor Krieg klein beigegeben, und nun, Herr, lasse Deinen Diener mit Frieden 
in die Grube fahren! 

Die  Oesterreicher thun ihr  Möglichstes, um  das,  so  weit es der Steuerdruck er 
laubte,  vor  dem  Mailänder  Putsch  ganz  in  Handel  und  Prosperität  aufgegangene 
Italien wieder in Bewegimg zu setzen, und wenn das Ganze nur noch ein Paar Monate 
so  fortgeht,  ist  Europa  ausgezeichnet  vorbereitet  und  es  bedarf nur noch des  An 
stoßes der Krise. Dazu kommt, daß die unerhörte und lange Prosperität—seit Anfang 
'49 — die Kräfte der erschöpften Parteien — so weit sie nicht wie die monarchischen 
in Frankreich bereits ganz verschlissen sind — viel rascher wieder restaurirt hat, als 
dies  früher  nach  1830 bei lange  schwankenden und im Ganzen farblosen Handels-
verhältnissen der Fall war. Auch war 1848 blos das Pariser Proletariat, später Ungarn 
und  Italien,  durch  ernste  Kämpfe  erschöpft,  denn  die  Insurrektionen Frankreichs 
nach dem Juni waren ja kaum der Rede werth und ruimrten schließlich nur die alten 
monarchischen  Parteien.  Dazu  das  komische Resultat der Bewegung in allen Län 
dern, an dem Nichts ernsthaft und wichtig ist, als eben die kolossale historische Ironie 
und  die  Koncentration  der  russischen  Kriegsressourcen,  so  daß  es  selbst bei  der 
allernüchternsten Betrachtung der Dinge unmöglich erscheint, daß die gegenwärtige 
Sachlage  das  Frühjahr  1854 noch überdauern kann.

L.S.D.,  or  Class  Budgets,  and  Who's  Relieved  by  Them 

The  People's  Paper. 
Nr. 51, 23. April 1853 

L . S . D .,  or  C l a ss  B u d g e t s, 

a nd  W h o 's  R e l i e v ed  by  T h e m. 

Gladstone has brought forth his Budget. We have heard two cocks on a barn  floor 
crowing against each other, in style somewhat similar to that of the two Chancellors 
5  of the Exchequer—Ex and Actual—on the floor of the House of Commons—with this 
difference, that the Whig Bantam has borrowed some of the notes of the Conservative 
Turkey.  Last week we analysed that portion of Mr. Gladstone's financial plan which 
deals with the National Debt, and showed how it was a miserable paltering with the 
question, and a mere matter of convenience to usurers, stockjobbers, and merchants, 
to  facilitate and cheapen their transactions.  We shall see, on the present occasion, 
that the Budget is a class Budget—a middle class Budget—written by an aristocratic 
pen.  We will, first, give a brief outline of this notable affair:— 

10 

I.—As  to Expenditure and Revenue: 
The  Chancellor  states  that  the  National  Expenditure  for  the  present  year  will 
15  exceed  that  of  the  last, by £1,400,000!!  A promising way of opening a Budget of 

Financial Reform. The cause of the increase is not less encouraging. 

It  comprises  an  increase  in our  naval  force  of £617,000;  in the  army and  com 
missariat  of  £90,000;  for  the  ordnance  £616,000;  for  the  militia  £230,000.  While 
education,  the  arm  of  enlightenment  and  the  defence  of  knowledge,  receives  an 
increase  of  only £100,000.  The total estimated  expenditure  of the  country  for the 
current year, is placed at £52,183,000. The total income is estimated at £52,990,000-
showing  a  surplus  of £807,000, from which, however, £100,000 is deducted for the 
packet service, and altogether an available  surplus predicted of £500,000. 

20 

25 

We now approach 
11—The Financial Scheme. 
Here the Chancellor deals:—Firstly, With the Income Tax; and makes no distinction 
between fixed  and precarious incomes. He proposes to reduce, after two years, the 
tax from 7d. to 6d. in the pound. Then, after two years more, from 6d. to 5d. for three 
years—to extend the tax to Ireland, and to lower it so as to embrace incomes of £100 
30  per annum. This, he says, "will not touch upon the ranks of labour." The incomes 
between £100 and £150 are to pay only 5d. in the pound. The effect of this will be, 
to lighten the burdens of the rich, and cast that alleviation as a weight upon the less 

583 

t 

Wilhelm  Pieper 

rich. The wealthy tradesman is to pay less, but, to make up for it, the poor tradesman 
is to pay where he did not pay directly before. This is strange justice—for four years, 
it is true, the man of £100 ist to pay 2d. in the pound less than he of £150, or £150,000-
but after that period  they pay the  same—while after two  years the rich man comes 
into  the  benefit  of  a  reduction  effected  by  taxing  the  poorer  one.  Our  notion  of 
taxation would  far  sooner  incline  to  a graduated  scale in which the percentage in 
creased with the amount of the income, for 10,000 fivepences are less to the man of 
£10,000 per annum, than 100 fivepences to him of £100. So much for Whig Finance— 
with a specious, paltry, and roundabout tinkering, it gradually but surely lightens the 
burdens of the rich and increases the burdens of the poor. As to saying that the Income 10 
Tax does  not affect the working man, it is a patent absurdity, for under our present 
social system of employer and employed, the middle class man generally indemnifies 
himself for additional  taxation in diminished wages  or  increased prices. 

5 

Secondly,  The  Chancellor  proceeds  to  the  legacy  duties.  Here  he  relieves  the 

sons-in-law and daughters-in-law from the "relations' " duty of 10 per cent, reducing 15 
theirs  to 7 per cent—infinitesimal boon!—and includes all property within the opera 
tions of the tax, the succession to rateable property being taxed on the life interest. 
By this means he adds £2,000,000 to the taxation of the country, and takes credit to 
himself for supporting skill and industry as against property. This clause recognises 
a principle,  and  is  a  significant  concession, extorted by industrial and commercial  20 
development from propertied monopoly.  It is, we repeat, a concession; but one the 
evasion of which is not only easy, but may possibly have been borne in mind by the 
propertied legislators  of the financial world. 

Thirdly,  The  stamp  duties  for receipts  are  to be  repealed,  and  the affixing of a 

penny postage stamp to a receipt of any amount is in future to be sufficient. A great  25 
measure  of  convenience—to  the  rich—in which the increased use of  stamps is  sup 
posed to counterbalance the loss of revenue, but in which, again, no benefit is con 
ferred  on  the  working  classes,  in  but  very  few  of  whose  transactions  matter  of 
sufficient value  (£5) to  demand a  stamp  ever comes under consideration. 

Fourthly, The Advertisement Duty is reduced to 6d., instead of  Is. 6d., as now.  30 

This  is  another instance of miserable tinkering.  No  sound reason can be advanced 
for keeping the  sixpence if you give up the shilling—inasmuch as the cumbrous and 
expensive machinery for collecting the sixpence will eat up the proceeds of the tax! 
But the reason may possibly be, not to have to give up the posts and appointments 
connected with the  levying  of that impost.  Supplements to newspapers containing  35 
advertisements only—are to go free by post. Both these clauses are a concession to 
the  middle  class—while  the  retention  of  the  newspaper  stamp  still fronts  with its 
massive barrier the spread of Democratic education. "The present papers shall have 
advantages,"  says  the  Chancellor,  "but  new  ones,  and cheaper  ones,  shall  not be 
started." 

40 

Fifthly, The Tax on Life Assurance is reduced from 2s. 6d. to 6d.—another instance 
of the same paltering spirit; indentures of apprenticeship, without consideration, from 
£1  to  2s.  6d.;  attorneys' certificates from £12 and £8 to £9 and £6; and the articles 
of  clerks  from £120  to  £80.  The  first and  two  last items  of the  above  are  again  a 
manifest relief to the middle class, but not the shadow of a benefit to the poor—while  45 

584 

L.S.D., or Class Budgets, and Who's  Relieved by Them 

the tax of 6d. is kept on advertisements, the Newspaper Stamp Duties and the Taxes 
on  Paper  are  retained,  in  order  that those  on  servants,  dogs,  and  horses, may be 
reduced to benefit the  rich. 

Sixthly, In Scotland and Ireland an addition is to be made to the Spirit Duties—and 

5 

the distillers are to have  an allowance for "waste." 

Seventhly, Tradesmen's Licences (another boon to the middle class) are to be more 

equalised. 

Eighthly, The Soap Duties, and a host of others, are to be dealt with, and the Duty 
on Tea is to be reduced from 2s.  2ll4d. to Is.  lOd. up to '54; to Is. 3d. to '56; and to 
Is. after that date. 

10 

Such is a fair outline of the Whig Budget; and we ask our readers whether a more 
contemptible piece  of  "Penny-legislation," to use the Chancellor's own expression, 
ever emanated from the Treasury Bench? It is plausible, specious, and sets forth some 
showy  points;  but  what  real  benefit,  what  real  relief,  is  conferred on the working 
15  classes  of this  country?  The  reduction of  the  duties  on  soap  and  tea are the only 
features  at which one  can catch; but  small indeed is  the relief thus  conferred.  The 
margin has everywhere been nicely measured, beyond which the working man would 
gain—the aristocrat and middle classes lose; and the transgression of that margin has 
been  studiously  avoided.  The  Budget  is  likely  to  catch the thoughtless among the 
20 people: "Reduction of Advertisement Duty to 6d. and Suppression of the Supplement 
Stamp!"  But what  does  it practically  amount  to  for  the  people? Nothing!  "Penny 
Receipt  Stamps!"  But  what is  that to  the wages-slaves who "receive"  starvation? 
Absolutely nothing.  "Life Assurances reduced from 2s. 6d. to 6d." What is it to the 
toiler at 6s., 8s., 10s., per week—who cannot insure his life from the crushing slavery 
25 of Manchester? Ay, or even to him at £1 and 30s.? Nothing! What is it to the working-
man that attorneys can get certificates for £3 less? Or clerks be articled for £80 instead 
of £40  more?  What to them is the hghtning of the legacy duty in one item, and  its 
general  extension  so easily avoided? Does it ease their burthen by the weight of a 
single feather? What is it to them that the shopkeepers' licences shall be more equal-
ised,  while  their  profits  on  labour's  wants  find  no  equality  with  labour's  wage? 
"Financial  Reform"  was  the  one  cry  out  of two  which seated this Parliament and 
raised this ministry. There you have it—the Reform of Whigs, aristocrats, and money-
mongers.  Something was  necessary—some  slight concession—the task was to make 
it  so  slight,  that  it  should  scarcely be perceptible, and admirably has the financial 
35 artist succeeded in his attempt. In his own words—to use his own expressions—Glad 
stone's  Budget is framed  "for the convenience  of the trading classes," and yet it is 
but a piece of  "Penny Legislation."

Soap  for  the  People,  a  Sop  for  "The  Times"—

Everybody  knows  that  a Budget  is  simply an estimate of the probable Revenue 
and Expenditure of Government for the year current, which estimate is based on the 
financial experience, i.e., on the balance  sheet for the past year. 

5 

The first thing, therefore, for Mr. Gladstone was to produce the balance sheet for 
the year 1852-3. Mr. Disraeli, in his statement as Chancellor of the Exchequer, has 
estimated the probable income for 1852-3 at £52,325,000, and the Expenditure for the 
same period at £51,163,000, thus anticipating a surplus of £1,162,000. Mr. Gladstone, 
in making up the actual balance from the books, discovers that the real amount of  10 
Revenue for the past year was £53,089,000, and the real Expenditure only £50,782,000, 
showing  an actual surplus of £2,307,000, or, as Mr. Gladstone calculates  (we know 
not in what way) £2,460,000. 

As it is  the fashion, or rather as Parliament affects, to consider the Chancellor of 
the Exchequer as the mysterious conjuror who, by nobody knows what secret tricks,  15 
contrives  to  produce  the whole yearly Revenue of the nation, it is no wonder that 
that  personage,  whoever  he  happens  to  be,  takes  care  not  to  discountenance  so 
flattering a delusion. Consequently, if the nation, by increasing the rate of production, 
is found to have swelled the amount of Tax Revenues above the estimate, it is taken 
for granted that the Minister of Finance who, by this process, can present more than  20 
double  the  surplus  his  predecessor  had  promised,  is  undoubtedly  the  man  of the 
greater financial  capacities. This was the cheerful idea of Mr. Gladstone, cheerfully 
received and appreciated by the supporters of the Coalition Oligarchy in the House. 

Two  Millions  Four Hundred and  Sixty 
Thousand Pounds Surplus! 
But not a farthing out of the two millions will the House permit to go to the people. 
Where, then, are they to go to? Mr. Gladstone explains it: "Favourable as this state 
ment may seem, the House must not forget that it has already largely drawn on this 
surplus by various  extraordinary votes  on the estimates  of the current year." 

25 

The House knew from Mr. Disraeli that there would be at all events a surplus of  30 

586 

Soap for the  People,  a  Sop for "The Times"—The Coalition  Budget 

more than one million of pounds. Accordingly, on going into Committee of Ways and 
Means, it voted merrily the following additional sums above and beyond the ordinary 
surplus:— 

For the Navy, including 
Packet Service 
Army and Commissariat 

£ 

617,000 
90,000 

To these sums, as Mr. Gladstone announced, will have to be added:— 

For the Kaffir war (no peace?) 
Increase on Ordnance 
Increase on Militia 
Public  (read private) Education 
Making a total of 

270,000 
616,000 
230,000 
100,000 
£1,923,000 

5 

10 

Mr. Gladstone  again (probably by omitting the  Kaffir war item on account of its 
uncertainty)  calculates  the  total  at  only  £1,654,000.  Deducting  this  sum from the 
15 original (barely figurative) surplus of £2,460,000, there would remain an actual surplus 
of £806,000,  or,  still calculating  with Mr. Gladstone, £807,000.  Yet, even from this 
moderate  sum  the  House  is  warned to deduct £220,000, accruing from precarious, 
and not recurring sources  of Revenue. Thus the original two millions, so cheerfully 
announced,  are  after  all but £587,000, by no means a very extensive basis for any 
20 even the most moderate reform of taxation. As, however, the country is assured that 
it  has  a  Ministry of  Reform,  Reforms there must be;  and Mr. Gladstone forthwith 
engages to bring out these  Reforms. 

An ordinary Free Trader, as Mr. Hume for instance, would perhaps have advised 
the Chancellor of the Exchequer to do good with his surplus, by the abolition of duties 
25  on such foreign articles, the revenue of which, as  shown by the Customs' Returns, 
would balance exactly the £587,000. What a vulgar, commonplace, profane suggestion 
to so learned and profound a financial alchemist as Mr. Gladstone ! Do you think that 
the man who contemplates nothing short of the suppression of the entire public debt, 
would gratify his ambition by the simple remission of £500,000 of taxes? Surely, for 
so  small  a purpose,  Sancho Timber needed not have  been removed to his  Indian 
Barataría, to make room  for the great Don Quixote of coalition finance.

Why, a remission of £5,315,000 taxes would unquestionably be a handsome thing. 
But  is  there  no  drawback in this  most liberal  Budget?  To  be  sure,  there  is.  Else, 
how  could it be called a Reform? Constitutional Reforms and Oxford Street shops,  25 
handsome  as  they  both  look,  are  sure  to  have  always  a  very  handsome  draw 
back. 

Of all clever tricks men contrive in the end to catch the secret. Mr. Gladstone, with 
only half a million in his bag, bestows a donation on the public of five million and 
a half. Whence does he get it? Ay, from the same blindfold public whom he bewilders 30 
with his generosity. He makes them a present, but invites them to return the favour. 
Of course, not in a direct or petulant manner, nor even from the  same people whom 
it is his purpose to win over now. There are various customers with whom he intends 
to  deal, and Russell, the juggler, has taught the adept Gladstone how to redeem his 
liberality of to-day by a revenge on to-morrow. 

35 

Gladstone  remits old taxes to the amount of £5,315,000.  Gladstone imposes  new 
ones  to  the  amount  of  £3,139,000.  Still  Gladstone  would  give  to  us  a  benefit  of 
£2,176,000. But Gladstone is, at the best, but the Minister of the year; and the amount 
of his contemplated reduction for the year is only £2,568,000, which will cause a loss 
to the Revenue of £1,656,000, to be balanced by the anticipated yield of the new taxes  40 
for the year, viz., £1,344,000, leaving a deficiency of £312,000, which, set off against 
the actual surplus, as stated in the Budget, of £807,000, would still show a favourable 
balance of £495,000. 

These are the principle features of the Coalition Budget. We shall now state to our 

588 

Soap for the  People, a Sop for "The Times"—The  Coalition Budget 

readers  what  are  the  points  of  which  the  Ministry hope  to  make  the  most—what 
objections are most likely to be raised against it by the various Parliamentary parties 
in opposition—and, in conclusion, what is our own opinion of the question. 

Gladstone, in all his  anxiety to create a sensation, and to  secure to himself both 
5 financial notoriety and popular favour by a large remission of taxes, felt the necessity 
of introducing his proposal for an increase of £3,139,000, under some plausible and 
apparently rational pretence. He was aware that he would not be permitted to nibble 
with  the  whole  system  of  taxation,  for  the  sole  purpose  of  an  uncailed-for  and 
unwarranted personal gratification,  without  some  show of what Parliamentary  and 
10  middle class men call  "principle and justice." Accordingly, he astutely resolved to 
take  the  legislating Pecksniffs  by  what  he  knew  to  be their weakest  side,  adroitly 
screening his  intended  augmentation of the public burdens behind the pleasant and 
acceptable phrase of a "just extension of certain taxes, with a view to their final and 
lasting equalisation." The imposts he chose for that object were:— 

15 

1. The Legacy Duty. 
2. The Spirits Excise; and, 
3. The Income Tax. 
The Legacy Duty he demands to embrace equally all kinds of property. As landed 
property  was  heretofore  exempted,  this  proposal  is  expected to  gratify  the  com-
20 mereiai and manufacturing interests. The Spirits Excise is to be extended to Scotland 

and Ireland,  so as to bring them more on a par with distilling England. 

Lastly, the Income Tax is to extend, in its area, to incomes between £150 and £100; 
and also to Ireland.  The Income Tax proposal is certainly not one of the points on 
which Gladstone can expect, or will obtain, much applause. But of that anon, when 

25  we come to the objections. 

Besides the  Legacy and Spirits proposition, the Free Trade reductions on a vast 
number  of  import  articles  are  undoubtedly  considered  by  Ministers  as  the  most 
attractive bait; and some favourable clamour is likely to be got up on this point by 
the  shopkeepers,  housewives,  and  the  small  middle  class  in general,  before they 
30  discover that, with regard to Tea, at least, a very trifling benefit will  accrue to the 
consumers, the profit of the holders and the monopoly of producers tending to absorb 
the greater part of the advantage. But, then, there is the entire abolition of the duty 
on Soap—a measure by which he hopes to enable the country to wash away not only 
its own dirty, filthy, and miserable appearance by making all faces clean, comfortable 
35  and happy; but also to  entirely abolish black slavery, and make an end to the mis 
fortunes of numberless. Uncle Toms, by the impulse given to "legitimate trading and 
production of African palm oil."  Assured by this,  Gladstone bids fair to out puff the 
fastest haberdasher and the most bombastic quack doctor.  To  these  attractive fea 
tures he  adds  a good  number of minor bribes, including one of several millions to 
40 the Irish Brigade, in the shape of a remission of the famine loan, and to the "Times," 
the big supporter of the "good Aberdeen," and his colleagues of the Coalition." This 
latter bribe consists in the abolition of the Stamp on Newspaper Supplements, con 
taining advertisements only, the "Times" being notoriously the only journal issuing 
any of the kind to  any extent. 

45 We come now to the objections that are most likely to be raised against the Budget 

589

from oppositional quarters. The discussion on Monday last, in the House, having been 
only an introductory skirmish, we must glean, if possible, from the daily papers the 
intentions of parties. And here we are very scantily supplied. The "Times," "Chron 
icle,"  and  "Post,"  are  actually  in  the  bonds of the Coalition Government, and the 
"Daily  News"  can  scarcely  be  regarded  as  the  organ  of the  Manchester  School. 
Besides, it is still vacillating, and apparently much tempted by the Free Trade proposi 
tions.  But if we look at the "Herald," the Tory-Conservative paper, we already find 
its  judgment  given;  and  with  a  truly  unusual  frankness:—"The  whole  Budget  of 
Mr. Gladstone," it says, "is nothing but a contemptible admixture of bribes and jobs." 
The  Tories,  therefore,  are  sure  to  oppose  the  scheme  of  Gladstone, from whom  10 
Disraeli will not fail to revindicate the stolen feathers of the Legacy and Income Tax 
extension, the Tea reduction, and other impudently-appropriated merits of his own. 
The landed aristocracy desire,  at all events, if they must submit to a further loss of 
privileges, to reserve to themselves the merit of a voluntary surrender. But as they 
cannot well take their stand on the Legacy Duty, Mr. Disraeli will cause them to rally 15 
around the  principle  of distinction between real and precarious  incomes, on which 
ground he will have a considerable portion of the Brigade fighting alongside with him. 
It is obvious  that the  Irish can and will never acknowledge the obligation of a debt, 
forced by the  English upon their country only in consequence  of the previous ruin 
of its population. Besides, for all practical purposes, theremission of the interestfrom 20 
£3,000,000 imaginary capital, must appear to them a very inadequate concession for 
the imposition of a spirit-excise and an Income-tax. As far as the Manchester School 
is concerned, although they are pledged to their constituents, if not on the abolition, 
at least on the transformation of the  Income-tax, it is not to  be  expected that they 
will act otherwise than as business  men, i.e. without any political honour, but with  25 
a very  due  regard  to  profit.  And  the  profit on the  side of Mr. Gladstone's budget, 
as  a  "whole,"  is  by  no  means  despicable,  as  far  as  those  gentlemen  are  con 
cerned. 

Now,  as to our opinion on the question at issue, we desire most eagerly to see a 

rriinistry defeated, which deserves equal contempt for its reactionary deceitful dodg-  30 
ery at home, as for its cowardly subservient policy abroad. And we think we are the 
more right in doing so, as such an event would certainly promote the interests of the 
people. One thing is clear: as long as an aristocratic coalition does the work required 
from them by the  manufacturing and trading class, the latter will neither make any 
political effort themselves, nor allow the working class to carry their own political  35 
movement.  If,  however,  the  country  party  once  more  obtain the  upper  hand,  the 
middle class cannot get rid of them without remodelling the rotten oligarchic parlia 
ment, and then it is no longer in their power to agitate for a limited reform, but they 
must go the whole length of the people's demands. The people, of course, can never, 
without abandoning both their principles and interests, join and appeal to the middle  40 
classes;  but for the  bourgeoisie, it would not be the first time that they are forced 
to throw themselves on the shoulders of the people. And such a contingency would 
lead to a very decided revolution in the present financial system. Already, it is evident 
that even middle class society inevitably tends towards the substitution of one direct 
property-tax in lieu of the traditional fiscal olla podrida. The Manchester School has 45 

590 

Soap for the  People, a  Sop for "The Times"—The Coalition  Budget 

long since registered, Disraeli has acknowledged, and even the oligarchic coalition 
has  confirmed,  the  principle  of  direct  taxation.  But let  the  machinery  of  a  direct 
property-tax be  once  properly established,  and the people, with political power in 
their hands, have only to put that engine into motion, in order to create the 

Budget  of  labour.

Den Parteikämpfen in der Emigration fehlt es  an dem welthistorischen Boden, auf 
dem sie dramatisch erscheinen und sich in Thaten übersetzen könnten; es fehlen die 
Massen, die ihnen Gewicht und Nachdruck geben, und wenn trotzdem die Repräsen 
tanten einzelner Fraktionen freiwillig die Rolle  Schüler'scher Helden übernehmen, 
die deklamirend der Welt von ihren großen Absichten erzählen, um ihr den Glauben 
an ihre hohe Bestimmung und unentbehrliche Leiterschaft aufzudrängen, so können 
derartige  Kraftanstrengungen allerdings nicht verfehlen, den Schein der Lächerlich 
keit über alle Bestrebungen der Emigration zu verbreiten, wenigstens in den Augen 
derer, die keine Unterscheidungen zu machen gewohnt sind.

Am  Bequemsten  ist  es  nun  freilich,  all'  diesen  Vorgängen  mit  vornehmem 
Achselzucken  den Rücken zu  kehren, wie es von Vielen geschieht, die sich in der 
hochmüthigen Pharisäerrolle besser gefallen, als in der des Zöllners ; es ist bequemer, 
aus einer „höhern Warte" seines Leibes zu pflegen, als sich selbst in die Parteikämpfe 
zu  mischen  oder  sich auch nur um  ihre wirkliche Bedeutung zu bekümmern. Aber  15 
am  Ende  sind  doch  die  sich  im  Exil  befehdenden  Elemente  nichts  anders,  als 
Bruchstücke  und  Repräsentanten der  jetzt in der  Heimath gemeinschaftlich  unter 
drückten Klassen, die,  so weit es die beschränkten Verhältnisse gestatten, für sich 
allein den Kampf fortzuführen,  an dem die Massen gewaltsam verhindert sind, und 
auf  Beachtung  haben  sie  einen um  so größeren Anspruch,  als  Manche  von ihnen  20 
berufen  sind,  in  der  bevorstehenden  Revolution  eine  hervorragende  Stellung  ein 
zunehmen,  Viele  sich  aber berufen halten und  eine  solche  anstreben werden.  Ein 
richtiges  Verständniß der Parteikämpfe in der Emigration muß das Verständniß der 
Parteikämpfe in der Revolution erleichtern und vorbereiten; doch muß man sich dabei 
wohl hüten, die kleinlichen Intriguen auf gleicher Basis stehender Personen mit den  25 
Befriedigungen  der  verschiedenen prinzipiell von  einander  abweichenden Gruppen 
zu  verwechseln. 

Die Lebens- und Existenzbedingungen der verschiedenen Klassen der kämpfenden 
Gesellschaft  sind  zugleich  die  Bedingungen,  welche  die  Haltung  ihrer  exilirten 
Repräsentanten bestimmen, an der Unversöhnlichkeit ihrer Interessen scheitern hier  30 
wie  dort alle  Einigungsversuche wohlmeinender Philister und berechnender Speku

über  den man  sich nicht vereinigen kann, denn wenn die  Einen zufrieden  sind mit 
der Vernichtung der „Despoten und Tyrannen", sehen die Anderen größere Gefahr 
drohen von den jetzt wieder revolutionär gewordenen Bourgeois-Fraktionen, denen 
im Februar und März die alte Ordnung ihre Rettung verdankte. 

5  Wie wäre es z. B. denkbar, daß die Vertreter des Proletariats Hand in Hand gingen 
mit einem Ledru Rollin und dessen Verbündeten, der im Juni 1848 als Repräsentant 
des  Exekutiv-Ausschusses  die  Nationalgarde  nach  Paris  beorderte,  um  das  zur 
Verzweiflung getriebene Proletariat in den Straßen niedermetzeln zu lassen? wie mit 
einem  Kossuth,  der  den  englischen Baumwollenlords  gegenüber  sich  anmaßt,  der 
10  Zukunft des Sozialismus ein Halt gebieten zu wollen, oder einem Mazzini, der nur 
mit  der  Bauern  schindenden  Landaristokratie  und  der  spekulirenden  Mittelklasse 
konspirirt, und sein Italien glücklich preist, daß noch keine sozialen Wühlereien die 
Herrschaft  der  Besitzenden bedrohe? 

15 

Dort,  wo  sich durch die  vorausgegangenen Revolutionskämpfe  die  Parteien  am 
schärfsten gesondert haben, bei den Franzosen, begegnen wir auch den bestimmte 
sten  Gruppirungen  in der  Emigration.  Wie  in der Nationalversammlung finden wir 
eine Rechte, ein Centrum und eine Linke, nur die Personen, welche die verschiedenen 
Bänke besetzt halten, haben gewechselt. Die verrotteten monarchischen Parteien sind 
so  gut wie  abgetreten von  der  Bühne,  aber um  der  Blouse  des  Arbeiters  Platz zu 
20 machen, ist die polternde Montagne ihnen nachgerückt. Ledru Rollin mit den Seinen 
büdet  die  Rechte der Emigration.  Ledru Rollin, der Führer des für seine Boutique 
gegen die Revolution f anatisirten Kleinbürgerthums von 1848, der unglückliche Held 
der kleinbürgerlichen Tragikomedie von 1849, der Freund Ruge's und Amand Goegg's 
und  der  deutsch-amerikanischen  Zwangssteuer  zur  Herstellung eines  Putsches  in 
25  der Hauptstadt der Revolutionen.  Aus  der Revolution hat er für seine Gesellschaft 
nichts als den Namen (la révolution) gerettet, aber der wirklichen Revolution möchte 
er nur das Prävenire spielen, um die bürgerliche Gesellschaft vor der Revolution des 
Proletariats  zu retten. 

Das  Centrum  nimmt mit einem Häuflein Getreuer Louis Blanc ein, der Mann des 
30  bürgerlich  vermittelnden  Sozialismus,  der  bürgerlich bescheidenen  Assoziationen 
und  der gleichen Arbeitslöhne,  der  1848 im Luxemburg Palaste für das Proletariat 
diskutirte, während draußen die Bourgeoisie  sich gegen das Proletariat rüstete und 
handelte.  Er  gehört  zu denen, welche Blanqui in seinem berühmten Toaste*)  „des 
Mordes  an  der  Revolution"  beschuldigt.  „Euer  Haupt ist es,  auf  das  die  Verant-
35  wortlichkeit für alle die Niederlagen, das Blut von so viel Tausenden von Schlacht 
opfern zurückfallen muß. Die Reaktion ging nur ihrem Gewerbe nach, indem sie die 
Demokratie  erwürgte.  Das  Verbrechen  ist  auf  Seite  der  Verräther,  die  das  ver-
trauungsvolle Volk zu seinen Führern auserkoren und es der Reaktion überantwortet 
haben." 

40 *) 1851 hatten Louis Blanc und Cons. ein Banquett veranstaltet zur Jahresfeier des 24. Februar; 
die  Banquett  Kommission forderte den in Belle Isle gefangenen Blanqui auf,  dasselbe durch 
einen Toast zu verherrlichen; er leistete der Aufforderung durch die obige Einsendung Folge, 
aber  die Bankettirer zogen es vor, denselben unvorgelesen ad acta zu legen. Dir Zweck, sich 
als die Alliirten Blanqui's darzustellen und sich dadurch die Sympathieen des Proletariats wieder 

45  zuzuwenden, war verfehlt.

August Blanqui ist der anerkannte Führer der proletarischen Opposition; er selbst 
ist  freilich  ein  Bewohner französischer Gefängnisse,  aber  seine Partei ist die  zahl 
reichste in der Emigration und in Frankreich wird sie bald die mächtigste sein, wenn 
auch  die  anderen  Parteien  auf  diese  proletarische  „Populace"  mit  einer gewissen 
Verachtung herabsehen.  Schon im Februar  1848 versuchte es Blanqui, die Arbeiter 
zu einer festgeschlossenen Partei zu organisiren,*) welche auf den Gang der Revo 
lution bestimmend einwirken und nach einander die übrigen Parteien von der Staats 
gewalt  verdrängen  könnte;  aber  schon  nach  einigen  Monaten  entrissen  ihn  die 
Ereignisse  wieder  dem  Schauplatze  seiner  Wirksamkeit.  Die  Revolutions-Politik 
dieser Partei findet ihren prägnantesten Ausdruck in demselben Toast[e], in welchem 10 
Blanqui  seine  Verwünschungen  über  die  „Escamoteure  des Februars"  ausspricht. 
— „Es ist nicht genug, daß die Escamoteure des Februars für immer von dem Hotel 
de  Ville  vertrieben  sind,  man  muß  sich  auch  gegen  neue  Verräther schützen.  — 
Verräther würden die Regierungslenker sein, die nicht auf der Stelle in's Werk setzen: 
1)  Die  allgemeine  Entwaffnung  der  Bourgeois-Garden;  2)  Die  Bewaffnung aller  15 
Arbeiter und ihre Organisation als nationale Miliz. — Ohne Frage gibt es noch andere 
unerläßliche  Maßregeln;  aber  sie  werden  naturwüchsig  aus  diesem  ersten  Akte 
entspringen, der dem Volke eine vorläufige Garantie gewährt und das einzige Sicher 
heitspfand  für  dasselbe  ist.  — Nicht  ein  einziges  Gewehr  darf  in  den Händen  der 
Bourgeoisie zurückbleiben. Ohne das kein Heil!...  Bewaffnung und Organisation,  20 
das ist das entscheidende Element des Fortschrittes,  das ernsthafte Mittel, um mit 
dem Elende  aufzuräumen.  Wer Eisen hat, hat Brod. Man fällt nieder vor den Bajo 
netten,  waffenlose  Haufen fegt  man  auseinander. 

Frankreich  starrt  von Arbeitern  unter  Waffen,  das  ist  die  Thronbesteigung  des 

Sozialismus.  — Gegenüber den bewaffneten Proletariern verschwindet Alles, Hin-  25 
démisse,  Widerstand,  Unmöglichkeiten.  Aber für  Proletarier,  die  sich mit lächer 
lichen  Straßenpromenaden,  durch das Einpflanzen von Freiheitsbäumen und wohl 
klingende  Advocaten-Phrasen amüsiren lassen, wird es  Anfangs Weihwasser, dann 
Injurien,  endlich  Kartätschenhagel und Elend  ohne  Unterbrechung geben!" 

Mit den  Blanquisten  steht von  der  deutschen Emigration derjenige  Theil in un-  30 

mittelbarer  Verbindung,  der  in  neuerer  Zeit als der  „Bund der Kommunisten"  die 
öffentliche Aufmerksamkeit so vielfach beschäftigt hat, die „Marxianer", wie sie von 
ihren  Gegnern  speziell  titulirt  werden.  „Seit  der  Niederlage  der  Revolution  von 
1848—1849",  sagt  Karl  Marx  darüber  in  seinen  „Enthüllungen über  den Kommu-
nistenprozeß zu Köln", „verlor die proletarische Partei auf dem Kontinent, was sie  35 
früher während jener kurzen Epoche ausnahmsweise besaß: Presse, Redefreiheit und 
Assoziationsrecht,  d. h.  die  legalen  Mittel  der Partei-Organisation.  Die bürgerlich-
liberale wie die kleinbürgerlich-demokratische Partei fanden in der sozialen Stellung 
der Klassen, die sie vertreten, trotz der Reaktion die Bedingungen, unter einer oder 
der anderen Form zusammenzuhalten und ihre Gemein-Interessen mehr oder minder 40 
geltend zu machen. Der proletarischen Partei stand nach 1849**) wie vor 1848 nur ein 
Weg offen — der Weg der geheimen Verbindung. Seit 1849 entstanden daher auf dem

Die  Parteien in der Emigration in  England 

Kontinent eine ganze Reihe geheimer proletarischer Verbindungen, von der Polizei 
entdeckt,  von  den Gerichten verdammt, von den Gefängnissen durchbrochen, von 
den  Verhältnissen  stets  wieder  neu  hergestellt.  —  Ein  Theil  dieser geheimen Ge 
sellschaften bezweckte  direkt den  Umsturz  der  bestehenden  Staatsmacht.  Es war 
5 dies berechtigt in Frankreich, wo das Proletariat von der Bourgeoisie besiegt war und 
der  Angriff  auf  die  bestehende  Regierung  mit  dem  Angriff  auf  die  Bourgeoisie 
unmittelbar zusammenfiel. Ein anderer Theil der geheimen Gesellschaften bezweckte 
die  Parteibildung  des  Proletariats,  ohne  sich um  die  bestehenden Regierungen zu 
kümmern. Es war dies nothwendig in Ländern, wie Deutschland, wo Bourgeoisie und 
10  Proletariat  gemeinsam  ihren  halb  feudalen  Regierungen  unterlagen,  wo  also  ein 
siegreicher Angriff auf die bestehenden Regierungen der Bourgeoisie oder doch den 
sogenannten  Mittelständen,  statt  ihre  Macht  zu  brechen,  zunächst  zur  Herrschaft 
verhelfen mußte. Kein Zweifel, daß auch hier die Mitglieder der proletarischen Partei 
an einer Revolution gegen den status quo sich von Neuem betheiligen würden; aber 
15 es gehörte nicht zu ihrer Aufgabe, diese Revolution vorzubereiten, für sie zu agitiren, 
zu konspiriren, zu komplottiren. Sie konnten den allgemeinen Verhältnissen und den 
direkt  betheiligten  Klassen  diese  Vorbereitung  überlassen.  Sie  mußten  sie  ihnen 
überlassen, wollten sie  nicht auf  ihre  eigene Parteistellung und auf die historischen 
Aufgaben verzichten, die aus den allgemeinen Existenzbedingungen des Proletariats 
20  von  selbst hervorgehen.  Für  sie waren die jetzigen Regierungen nur ephemere Er 
scheinungen und der  status  quo nur ein kurzer Haltpunkt, woran sich abzuarbeiten 
einer kleinlich engherzigen Demokratie überlassen blieb. — Der ,Bund der Kommu 
nisten'war daher keine konspiratorische Gesellschaft, sondern eine Gesellschaft, die 
die  Organisation  der proletarischen Partei im  Geheimen bewerkstelligte, weil das 
25  deutsche  Proletariat  igne  et  aqua (von  Feuer und Wasser)  von Rede,  Schrift und 

Assoziation  öffentlich  interdicirt  ist." 

Von diesem Bunde  sonderte sich eine Fraktion ab, oder ward, wie man will, eine 
Fraktion  abgesondert,  die,  wenn  auch  nicht  wirkliche  Konspirationen,  doch  den 
Schein der  Konspiration  und  daher  direkt Allianz mit  den demokratischen Tages-
30  helden verlangte, Ehrgeizige, denen vor allen Dingen die Ausbeutung der nächsten 
Revolution in ihrem eigenen Interesse mehr am Herzen lag, als der endliche Sieg des 
Proletariats,  als dessen Vertreter sie sich bis dahin gespreizt hatten.  Wir begegnen 
ihnen wieder  als  Theünehmer  von  Louis  Blanc'schen  Banketten,  als eifrigen För 
derern  der  sogenannten  Revolutionsanleihe,  deren  Basis  die  Verhöhnung  der ver-
35  schiedenen  Gesellschaftsklassen,  die Vertuschung der  Parteigegensätze,  also  eine 
Politik ist, die dem Interesse des Proletariats am allerverderblichsten werden muß, 
indem  sie  der  Täuschung und  dem  Verrath wieder Thür und Thor  öffnet.  In theo 
retischer Beziehung bleiben Emigrations-, Revolutions-, Agitations-Vereine, und wie 
sie  sich  sonst  auch  nennen  mögen, weit hinter  den entsprechenden Vereinigungen 
40  der  Franzosen  zurück,  ganz  entsprechend  der größeren Verkommenheit des deut 
schen  Kleinbürgerthums,  das  in  die  größeren  Weltverhältnisse  erst  durch  seine 
unglücklichen Revolutionsversuche hineingestoßen wurde, ohne sich bis jetzt darin 
zurechtfinden  zu  können. 

Wenn wir bei Ungarn und Italienern eine größere Einigkeit finden,—obschon auch

When  the  "Times,"  the  other  day,  half-drowned  in  prosperity,  champaigne,  and 
comfortably  suffocating  in  its  own  swelling  fatness,  meekly  stammered  forth the 
5  words:  "We  are  now  all  happy and  united,"  the  "Times"  spoke  a  "truth," which 
neither aristocracy, nor middle class, nor any "Englishman" contradicted. The fact 
is, that  since manufacturers  have put their foot on the landlords, and have brought 
the  twenty  years'  war  against  them  to  a final  settlement in their favour;  since the 
landlords,  on the  other  hand, have  accepted their defeat, glad enough to be left in 
the  enjoyment of state-plunder and patronage, all making the best, by jobbing and 
speculating, of the present "prosperity"—there prevails the same delightful harmony 
between  all  factions  of  capitalists  and  their  representatives  in  Parliament,  trifling 
quibbles excepted, as may be seen between the various animals of a "happy family." 
The  secret  of the "happiness" and "union" is intoxication, in the one case by gin, 
in the other, by "prosperity." 

15 

10 

Parliament, the middle class, and, of course, mother "Times" are therefore, natu 
rally enough, enraged, that the working classes suddenly intrude upon that happiness 
with  the  complaints  of  their  misery.  To  express  that  anger  they  are  indeed  too 
"well-bred" and too meek, except by remarking on the "painfulness of the subject." 
20  But that is  only their first word for which they select a fair  sounding one. Let the 
people insist, press upon them, get "clamorous," i.e., determined, and the foul words 
will come bye  and by. 

25 

What a degrading spectacle is that of a Legislative Assembly, so vile, so corrupt, 
so lazy, and so mindless of honour, that every interruption of their ordinary somno-
lence,  every  occurrence  calling for  their  attention,  every  event  stirring them  into 
activity is deemed—nay, openly professed to be a "most painful" thing. But it is not 
the existence of evils, abuses, horrors, dangers, etc., that "pains" these nerve-stricken 
senators, but the bringing those things under their eyes and noses, the obliging them 
to  "touch" on those  "delicate  subjects"—this is the  "pain" over which they sob. 

30 

"Painful" was not the existence of the tremendous amount of bribery at the late 

599 

Wilhelm  Pieper 

General Elections, but only the notice Parliament was compelled to take of it. "Pain 
ful"  was  not the  more  or less  extensive  corruption of the  several branches of the 
Administration,  but  that that corruption had been discovered and exposed to pub 
licity. "Painful" was not the infamous oppression of frame workers under the abomi 
nable stoppage system, but that persons made such a violent noise about it. "Painful" 5 
was not the Palmerston plot for establishing political espionage in England, but only 
the  detection  and  denunciation of  the  plot.  "Painful"  is  not the  aggression of  the 
Muscovite  despot  on the independence of his neighbour countries, but the "duty" 
of  reflecting  on the  means  of  protecting Turkey, or of  "one day providing for the 
reconstruction of that crumbling Empire." And "painful" in the present instance is  10 
not the factory-slaves oppression under the avowed infraction of the act of 1850, not 
the destruction of the health of women by compulsory over-working, not the practice 
of the fraudulent system of shifts and relays, not the crippling of a whole generation 
under exhausting drudgery, not even the incredible and unqualifiable revelation that 
the average age amongst factory operatives has sunk down to nearly eig/if years (the 15 
average  life  attained by  middle class individuals being twenty-eight years), all this 
is perfectly indifferent to honourable incumbents and the virtuous "Times." "Pain 
ful"—only  that  the  condition  of  factory  operatives  should  have  been  alluded  to. 
"Painful"—that the workmen recommence to agitate, and philanthropists to declaim. 
Yes, that is the most "painful" thing, that the factory people will not be ground down 20 
in silence. 

Upon Mr. Cobbett's motion for leave to bring in a "bill to limit the hours of labour 
of women, young persons,  and children in factories to ten hours  a day for the first 
five  days  of  the  week,  and  to  seven  hours  and  a-half  on  Saturdays,"  what  said 
honourable  members in the  Lower House, not the few philanthropists, but the de-  25 
termined middle  class  majority? Listen to  Sir George Grey:  "He must express his 
painful  regret that  the  question  had  been  re-opened."  Verily,  England  has  now  a 
painful  House  of  Commons.  And  what  said  the  middle  class  majority  out  of  the 
House? Listen to the "Times":  "The revival of the factory agitation will give pain 
to that great majority of the public who supposed it to be set finally at rest in 1850."  30 
We dare say, the factory agitation, and the movement of the workingmen in general 
will yet afford a vast deal ofpam to that "great majority of the public" of the "Times." 
That  is  not  beyond their apprehension,  and hence the fury  of the  "Times"  against 
the  "men." 

The  "men"  have  no  representatives  in  Parliament;  for  all  immediate  wants  or  35 

desires, they have therefore to appeal to the patronage of some faction in the House. 
As the battles between the two upper classes are not only fought always at the cost 
of the working class, but also "for their own gain," the "men" always find one side 
ready to  take them  under their "protection." Up to the passing of the Reform Bill, 
and the abolition of the Corn Laws, it was the middle class—since then, the defeated  40 
aristocracy,  who  stood  up  "for  the  interests  of  the  labouring men."  Philanthropy 
ever sits on the Opposition benches.  Naturally enough, philanthropy only protects 
those who suffer themselves to be cared for as dupes and dependents. The men must 
not,  therefore,  stand  up  for  their  interests.  If  they do, philanthropy does not care 
for  them.  In  the  hands  of  philanthropy  the  men must remain  slaves—witness  the  45 

600 

The Ten  Hours  Bill,  Parliament,  "The Times"  and the "Men" 

history of the Ten Hours Act. The philanthropic Opposition inflicted the Act of 1847 
as  a revenge on their victorious Free Trade antagonists, the manufacturers offering 
no great opposition at a time when there was a crisis of industry, and no demand for 
any  hours'  labour  at  all.  The  men,  reaping  no  good  from  the  Act,  bade  adieu to 
5  philanthropy,  and threw themselves  into independent political  agitation. What did 
philanthropy?  It  inflicted  the  Compromise  Act  of  1850,  as  a revenge  on the men. 
Manufacturers again let the philanthropists alone at a time when industrial prosperity 
made twelve and fourteen hours labour desirable. The men, in the meantime, have 
grown  noisy  again,  and  solicit  anew  the  protection of  philanthropy.  Philanthropy 
10  meets  their claim.  Philanthropy again proposes a Ten Hours Act. Shall we tell the 

men what will happen? 

In order to have a valid act,  and a guaranteed one, the restriction of the moving 
power is indispensable. That was demanded by Mr. Cobbett. Lord Palmerston seemed 
almost to  support it.  But what  said Lord John Russell? "If his colleague seemed to 
15  have held out hopes of legislation with respect to restricting the moving power, he 
could say that that had not been his intention. He had, on the contrary, meant to say 
that he was opposed to  any restriction of adult labour." And this was his principle! 
Mark this, my men! Further, what said Mr. Wilson Patten, a "Manchester man?" "Ii 
it was considered to restrict the moving power, he hoped the country would be given 
20  an opportunity to  consider  what was intended by the Government to  be done.  He 
could consider nothing more mischievous or despotic." What said Mr. Labouchere:— 
"He regretted that the  noble lord  (Palmerston) did not distinctly state his intention 
to resist a principle that would hold out false promises to the people." And now what 
says the "Times":—"We can only regard the imposition of certain hours on the motion 
25  of machinery as a piece of Socialism of the most tyrannical description. If this is the 
object, and it should ever pass into law, then England is no longer a place for a free 
man (i.e.  a capitalist) to live in." 

We ask the men, what chances of  success  they can hope for, after such declara 
tions?  Can they dream, for a moment, that the restriction of the motive power, the 
30  only  vital  condition  of  a  true  Ten  Hours  Act,  will  be  granted  by  a  middle  class 
Legislature?  They  cannot.  Then  what  have  they  to  expect  at the hands of philan 
thropy?  Nothing but  another  sham  Bill,  and  that even to be  again repealed with a 
vengeance on them, as soon as the inevitable crisis compels them to stand up directly 
for their interests. No Ten Hours Act, as in other measures for the good of the working 
35  man,  unless  Parliament be  a representation of  the working community.  Till then, 
hypocritical  declarations  in favour  of  "women,  young persons, and children," but 
no remedy. And "as to the men they must look after themselves." So concludes the 
"Times."  So do we conclude: Men!  Look  after  y o u r s e l v e s!

The  People's  Paper. 
Nr. 63,16. Juli 1853 

Old Nesselrode, the supposed "chief of the Peace Party in Russia," and the standing 
competitor  of  Elihu Burritt in palm-leaf epistles,  has  started  another circular note, 
and one which will have been read with "deep pain" by all the Aberdeens and Brights 5 
throughout this country. That note is a downright blow in their face. It has stunned 
them.  It has humiliated them. They are paralysed under the scorn, the provocation, 
the  deliberate  insults  with  which  the  Dalai-Lama  of  Order  has  visited  his  slaves 
according to their merit. Ah! you want peace at any price, my good gentlemen of the 
counter and desk? You shall creep to Peterhoff, then, as you crept to St. Cloud. 

10 

The peace-at-any-price-mongers of the London and Paris Cabinets and Exchanges 
are  thus  sneeringly  addressed  by  the  "chief  of  the  great  peace-party  in  the 
North" :—"If you want peace, why the devil did you put your nose into other people's 
quarrels? Did we not, on putting our ultimatum to the Porte, particularly inform the 
Great Powers of our intentions?" 

Did we not "especially engage Great Britain and France not to assume an attitude 
that would complicate the difficulties of the situation; not to take too soon measures 
which on the one hand would have the  effect of encouraging the  opposition of the 
Porte, and on the other would implicate still more than they were already the honour 
and dignity of the Emperor?" 

Did we not give you "forewarning not to lend your support to the Porte?" But you 

15 

20 

would not hear us.  No! 

The two maritime Powers have not thought fit to defer to the considerations which 
we recommended to their serious attention. Taking the initiative before us, they have 
judged  it  indispensable  to  anticipate  immediately,  by  an effective  measure,  those  25 
which  we  had  announced  to  them as  simply  eventual,  as  we  made the  execution 
thereof subordinate to the final resolutions of the Porte; and at this very moment the 
execution  of  them  has  not  yet  commenced;  they  at  once  sent  their  fleets  to  the 
Constantinople  waters;  they already occupy  the  waters  and ports  of the Ottoman 
domination,  within  reach  of  the  Dardanelles.  By  this  advanced  attitude  the  two  30 
powers  have  placed  us  under  the  weight of a comminatory demonstration, which, 
as  we foretold them,  must add new complications to the crisis. 

602 

A  Palm-Leaf from  the  Czar 

You have threatened us, and that was ridiculous, considering that you don't mean 
it,  considering that you  daily  stammer Peace on your knees. If you wanted peace, 
why had you no regard to "the successive concessions which we made from a sincere 
desire to  maintain good and friendly relations  with the Turkish government?" 

For,  you  know  that,  after  having  renounced  one  after  the  other  the  idea  of  a 
guarantee, obtained under the form of a convention,  sened,  or other  synallagmatic 
act, we reduced our demand to the signing of a simple note, such as that the text of 
which we transmitted to you. 

5 

Why did you oppose that simple concession? Why did you encourage Turkey to 
10  oust  away  our  peace-messenger  Menschikoff?  Why  did  you  talk  big,  when  we 
prepared  our  fleets  and  armies  for executing a faithless breaker of treaties? What 
good could you expect from your demonstrations and menaces, when we knew that 
Peace-at-any-price was  at the bottom  of your trembling hearts? 

All this, my sweet doves, as you might have foreseen, must become useless, vain, 

15  ridiculous.  You conceive that. 

In presence of the refusal of the Porte, supported by the manifestation of France 
and England, it becomes more impossible than ever for us to modify the resolutions 
which the  Emperor made  dependant upon it. 

In  consequence, his Imperial Majesty has just issued an order to the division of 
20  our troops  stationed at the present moment in Bessarabia to cross the frontier, and 

occupy the principalities. 

Therefore,  my  very  good  Aberdeens  and  other  quiet gentlefolks,  you will  now 
please  to  eat the  leek,  and in wishing you good appetite we hope you won't make 
an "awful" sour face. Perhaps you opine that we ought to have eaten the leek, instead 
25  of you. Pray, good fellows, do so now. Make us eat the leek, threaten us, attack us, 
press  us,  and  become  charged  with the  "awful  responsibility  of  causing a general 
war!!!"  Mind,  we don't think of war.  We have entered the principalities. 

Not  to  wage  an offensive war against the Porte, which on the  contrary we  shall 
endeavour to  avoid  as  long  as  we  are  not forced  into  it,  but because the Porte in 
30  persisting to refuse the moral guarantee which we had a right to expect, obliges us 
to  substitute  in  its  place  provisionally  a  material guarantee;  because  the  position 
which the two powers have taken in the ports and waters of his empire, in very sight 
of his  capital,  cannot be  regarded by us, under actual circumstances, in any other 
light than our honour or our safety may demand. It will be purely temporary; it will 
35  serve us solely as a pledge until better counsels shall have prevailed in the minds of 
the  Sultan's ministers. Whilst occupying the principalities for a period, we disavow 
beforehand all idea of conquest. We do not pretend to obtain any accession of terri 
tory. 

The instant the  Sultan has given us the satisfaction to which we are entitled, and 
40 at the same time takes order to remove the pressure exercised upon us by the attitude 
of the two Maritime Powers, our troops  shall return within the limits of Russia. 

Withdraw your fleet, leave the Sultan to himself-or rather to us—and your peace 
will be  safe.  Resist, support him,  let him  "compel us to over-step the narrow and 
well-defined circle to which we purpose to confine ourselves"—and on your shoulders 

45  we throw the responsibility of causing a general war. 

603 

Wilhelm  Pieper 

With this terrible insinuation Nesselrode leaves, and we shall there leave with him, 
the poor Aberdeens and the general coterie of tremblers to the shakings of their weak 
heads. To think of these treacherous cowards keeping the national honour, the inter 
ests of civilisation, the fate almost of Europe in their hands! What will they do with 
it? Lay it in trembling devotion at the feet of the Czar. Yes, that they will. They will 
pocket his insults, and their own degradation—for they dare not take up the gauntlet 
so  provokingly thrown down by the  Autocrat to them. 

5 

Their imbecile vacillation has allowed Austria and Prussia to be caught in Russia's 
intrigues:  In Berlin the king and his army celebrate the Czar's birthday with frantic 
enthusiasm.  In  Constantinople an Austrian Menschikoff replaces the Russian one.  10 
Already,  England  and  France  are  isolated.  What we ask, will our Peace tremblers 
do? Prostrate themselves before the Russian! Yes, that they will do. 

But, don't let us grow too warm at the humiliation of our masters. Could any one 
desire  to  see our decrepit oligarchy displaying new vitality? Could anyone wish our 
dead middle class  Parliament should suddenly be electrified into a patriotic Roman  15 
Senate?  Could  anyone  want our venal hypocrite press  should acquire the genuine 
power of enthusiastic, passionate, popular leading organs? No, a hundred time§ no! 
We  ought to  delight  in their  combined ignominy,  degradation,  and decomposition. 
And  well  may we  do  so.  For  the  weakness  of  our  masters  is  the  guaranty of our 
triumph. As to the Cossack, what matters it that he triumphs over our own counter-  20 
revolution—so  that revolution  will triumph over both.

T he  S t a te  of  F r a n c e. 

N o. l. 
Peasant  Proprietorship  and  Encumbrance. 

5 

Everybody understands how the little master tradesman is beaten out of the field by 
the  great  capitalist—how  the  handicraft  worker  is  crushed  by  the  application  of 
machinery,  and  how  the  wages  of  workmen generally diminish in consequence of 
improved and accelerated machine power. All this follows in the ordinary course of 
competition, and the development of modern manufacturing industry. But the French 
peasant  proprietor  has  nothing  in  common  with  any  of  those  industrials  who  are 
10  vanishing before the modern giant of production; he has neither to contend against 
a superior mode of cultivation at home, nor is he exposed to any competition whatever 
from  abroad; nor is he  a wages-slave who is compelled to  sell his labour-power to 
some profitmongering capitalist for a scanty subsistence. On the contrary, he is his 
own master,  a free  and  independent proprietor of  an instrument of production; yet 
15 his misery, his sufferings, his privations, are equal to any that can possibly be endured. 
Anomalous  as  it  may appear, it is nevertheless a fact, that while the proletarian is 
oppressed  and  miserable,  because  he has no instrument of production of his own, 
the peasant proprietor  suffers  because he  is proprietor. 

Although peasant proprietorship  is  of modern origin,  a brief  sketch of the  social 
20  position  of  the  peasantry  in  former  centuries  may  not be  without interest to  our 
readers, particularly  as that position is the  principal foundation of modern peasant 
proprietorship.  In  the  feudal  system,  as  originally  established,  land  was  held  as 
national property.  The  whole  system was  a military organisation to  all intents  and 
purposes, providing at the  same time, by a kind of social hierarchy and strict rules, 
for the performance of  all functions necessary for the maintenance of the common 
wealtii. Land being the chief, if not the only source of revenue, all public service was 
compensated  in land.  The  King,  as trustee of the nation, as chief administrator of 
the national lands, and head commander of the national defence, nominated all the 
high functionaries of state who in their civil capacity were governors of the provinces, 
30  and next to the king, in command of the army. They were vassals of the Crown, and 
disposed  of  the  minor  offices  in their respective districts, investing the  subalterns 

25 

605 

Johann  Georg  Eccarius 

with estates, the extent of which varied according to the services attached to them. 
As  the  civil  officers  were  the  commanders  on the battlefield, military  service was 
the only condition on which land could be held. Military service included full equip 
ment for  going to war, the means of  subsistence while engaged in it not excepted. 
Thus  the  division  of the  soil was regulated by the organisation of the national de-  5 
fence. 

At the bottom of all, excluded from the use of arms, any participation in the public 
service,  and  charged  with  the  maintenance  of  all,  were  the  serfs.  Labour  being 
considered a degraded and dishonourable occupation, the serfs were not only charged 
with the cultivation of the soil, but had to perform all kinds of work necessary for  10 
the maintenance of their superiors. War had therefore no disturbing influence upon 
production except in such places  where  engagements took place. 

The serfs of the feudal lord, in contradistinction to the slaves of the ancient states, 
had a claim to the  soil upon which they were born. The serfs could neither be sold 
nor removed ; they were part and parcel of their native estate, the possessor of which 15 
had to provide for their subsistence. To simplify the working of the system and make 
them, as it were, self-dependent, the serfs were lodged in cottages with sufficient land 
allotted to them to  support themselves  and families.  The  serfs  thus located, had to 
cultivate  gratis  that portion of  the estate which the lord of the manor retained for 
his own private benefit. 

20 

In a rude state of society, with an extremely plain and simple mode of living, when 
the produce of the land was more the  spontaneous gift of nature than the result of 
tillage and cultivation, when labour was so little divided and the task to be performed 
by the  workman  so  easy,  that almost every  one  could  execute the  ordinary work 
required for a household ; when the population was so thin that there was ample room 25 
for  all:  under  such  a  state  of  things the feudal  system was  probably not very op 
pressive. It was a decided step in advance compared to the ancient system of slavery 
under which the producers of wealth were a saleable commodity like the negro slaves 
in America at the present day. Besides though nobility was a necessary qualification 
for the  higher offices, the respective individuals were only invested with the titles  30 
and revenues of the land as appendages to the public service which they performed. 
It was a sacred trust, the violation of which subjected the offenders to removal and 
punishment.  The  common rule was that the possession of an estate ended with the 
demise of the trustee, his family having no claim whatever to it as an inheritance— 
though regard was frequently paid to the sons of faithful servants to the Crown. In  35 
the  course  of  time,  however,  the  nobility  succeeded  in  making  the  offices,  and 
consequently  the  estates,  hereditary  in  the  respective  families—they  established 
individual  proprietorship. 

Having succeeded in securing their possessions the great barons now tried to make 
the crown subservient to their interest, or emancipate themselves from its control.  40 
A  conflict  ensued,  which lasted for centuries, remarkable for its  cruelties, crimes, 
and devastations.  As an instance of the tender mercies of royalty, we may mention 
that, during the reign of Louis XI., no less than four thousand refractory barons were 
executed.  But though royalty fought with advantage, in the long run nothing could 
have rendered its ultimate triumph more complete than the invention of gunpowder, 45 

606 

The State  of  France 

and the consequent introduction of firearms into the  art of war.  A  single chemical 
composition threw  the  struggling and  haughty aristocracy prostrate before the feet 
of the  throne.  By  means  of gunpowder  the  strongholds of refractory barons  were 
easily destroyed—before the fire of disciplined and concentrated armies the scattered 
and ill-organised hosts of aristocratic dependants, their own peculiar mode of war 
fare, the entire strength of chivalry, crumbled into the dust. The weapons of the noble 
warriors became as useless to their owners as hand-looms and spinning-wheels are 
at the present day to  the workman. 

5 

15 

During the space of time over which our remarks extend the relation between serf 
10 and landlord was only modified inasmuch as the interest of the latter made it desirable. 
When towns became the principal seats of industry, the dexterity of the rustic serfs 
ceased to  satisfy the tastes  of their  masters.  But the  superior products of the town 
mechanics  could  only  be  obtained  by  giving  something  in  exchange—that  is,  by 
purchasing them. Money became the great desideratum. As the produce of agriculture 
found a ready sale in the towns, the landlords began to curtail their hospitality, and 
entered into  contracts  and covenants  with  some  of the  serfs. They put more land 
u.  Jer  cultivation,  and enlarged the holdings of those who distinguished themselves 
by "good conduct" and industry. For this they had to pay tribute. Besides, there were 
small freeholders who, in the time of the feuds, were unable to protect their holdings, 
20  and had to  seek protection from some powerful baron in the neighbourhood, which 
could only be obtained on tribute and soccage service. But there was yet another class 
of men—the  sons  of freeholders—who  could not settle on their fathers' estates; and 
who were averse, or not in a condition, to join the king's forces, or gain a subsistence 
in a town,  and were therefore obliged to accept  settlements in baronial dominions, 
in servile conditions. Thus, in the same degree as the political power of the barons 
declined, in the same degree increased their social power as landlords, their revenues, 
their command over the  luxuries  of life. 

25 

With the surrender of arms and political power the social position of the aristocracy 
became more  secure.  Royalty not only maintained and protected aristocratic privi-
30 leges, but rather increased them. The court, reposing on the laurels of victory, became 
distinguished  for  Oriental  pomp,  debauchery,  gorgeous feasts  and entertainments, 
in which  nobles  were  invited to participate.  In consequence of this, they left their 
rural habitations, gathered round the throne, and entirely abandoned their old habits 
of life. If the barons of old had been characterised by the recklessness of their feuds, 
35  highway  robberies,  and  revolts,  their  descendants,  in  their  new position,  as  if to 
indemnify themselves for past troubles, plunged with equal recklessness  into  vice, 
profligacy, and dissipation. With the progress of extravagance and luxury increased 
the  oppression of  the  peasantry.  Bailiffs  and  stewards became, in most cases, the 
sole managers of estates—who, to  satisfy the wants of their masters, resorted to all 
40  kinds of means to obtain money from the peasantry. Written deeds and covenants 
availed  little  against  the  rapacity of the landlords.  They possessed the jurisdiction 
over their dependants to the fullest extent. The judges before whom the peasant could 
complain  were  the  hirelings  of the  accuser,  and whoever  dared to refuse any kind 
of  payment  on the  authority  of  a written agreement, had to consider himself very 
fortunate if he did escape without being punished for his audacity. Moreover, it must 

45 

607 

Johann Georg  Eccarius 

be borne in mind, that those oppressed beings were by law prohibited from acquiring 
any kind of property. The land, the cottages, the goods, and cattle—the shirt on the 
back of the bondman-everything was the lawful property of the landlord. Whatever 
amount  of  money  the  peasant  might  save  by  his  industry  and frugality, had to be 
hoarded and kept out of the scent of the noble devourer. Such was the condition of  5 
the predecessors  of the present peasant proprietors. 

Whatever difference there was between the social condition of the rural and that 
of the town populations, there was only one feeling of discontent, indignation, and 
disgust, pervading the whole nation,  and  only waiting for  a favourable opportunity 
to explode. The court itself created this opportunity when, by its imbecile measures  10 
of  repression,  it  provoked  a  battle  in  the  streets  of  Paris  which  ended  with  the 
destruction of the Bastille, and a complete victory of the people, on July 14,1789. No 
sooner was  the  triumph of the Parisians known in the provinces than the peasantry 
set to work to avenge their grievances, and to shake off their yoke. They renounced 
all  obedience  to  the  aristocracy—they  lighted  bonfires  with  their  deeds  and  in-  15 
vestitures,  and  destroyed the castles  of tyrannical landlords.  To prevent confusion 
and anarchy, it now became necessary that the emancipation of the peasantry should 
be  forthwith  acknowledged  by  a legislative  act  of the newly-constituted authority, 
the  National  Assembly.  In one  single  night,  the 4th of August, all feudal burdens, 
privileges, and appendages—the whole social fabric of feudalism—were abolished. The 20 
tithes were declared to be redeemable, and should be commuted into a cash payment. 
On  a  subsequent  day,  however,  the  11th  of  August,  they  were entirely abolished, 
without  any  compensation whatever  to  the clergy. Thus, within the brief space of 
seven days, the peasantry were legally freed from all burdens, save the payment of 
taxes  to the  State. They became free and independent proprietors of the land they  25 
occupied. It was made a present to them. Further advantages were offered to the new 
citizen  proprietors,  when  the  crown  and  church  lands  were  declared  national 
property,  and  sold to  reimburse  the  creditors  of  the  State, and defray current ex 
penses.  In  addition to  these there were the estates of emigrated aristocrats, which 
were  sold for  the benefit of the treasury. The extent of land thus brought into the  30 
market, the urgent wants of the  State, the  scarcity of money—all tended to depress 
its price, so that all the advantages were on the side of the purchasers. The newly-
emancipated peasants purchased freely, but where did they get money? They opened 
their hoards—they disposed of money which, perhaps for years, had been locked up, 
and withdrawn from circulation. In less than ten years the peasantry was in posses-  35 
sion of the most considerable part of all landed property. Such is the origin of French 
peasant proprietorship. 

Hopeful as was the prospect of the peasantry half a century ago, peasant proprie 
torship in its further development has produced the most deplorable results. Peasant 
proprietorship is based on the division of the soil, and the French law of inheritance 40 
has led to sub-division; sub-division has produced encumbrance—encumbrance leads 
to beggary and ruin. According to the modern laws of inheritance in France, all the 
children of one father have equal claims to the patrimonial estate. Suppose a father 
of  four  children  being  in  possession  of  forty  acres  of  land,  unencumbered  at  his 
decease, this farm will be divided into four lots of ten acres each.  As this mode of  45 

608 

The State of  France 

5 

division  proceeds  with  each  successive  generation,  a  time  must  arrive  when  the 
properties become so small that further division becomes impossible, and at this stage 
encumbrance is unavoidable. As the children are equally entitled, whoever succeeds 
the father must mdemnify the sisters and brothers, unless the father's savings amount 
to  as many times the value of the farm  as there are children. As this is impossible, 
the  successor  generally  applies  to  a capitalist—a  mortgagee—to  obtain  the  money, 
which, as experience shows, becomes a permanent burden on the land. If the father, 
the proprietor of an encumbered farm could not save sufficient to leave the land free 
of debt to one of his children, how is it possible for him who enters his career with 
10  encumbrance, to leave it even under such unfavourable conditions to his next heir? 
It is  clear that every  succeeding generation begins under worst auspices, and that a 
time must arrive when the descendants of the once happy freeholders must give up 
their inheritance when they become beggars and paupers. To what extent of misery 
this  state  of things has already led, may be seen from official returns which, if they 
15  deviate  at all from  the  truth, represent the case rather favourably than otherwise. 

According to an official return of  1845  there were in France:— 

Dwellings with no 

aperture except the  door 

only one 
only two 

20 

348,401 
1,817,328 
1,328,937 
3,494,666 

In these wretched cabins vegetate full 16,000,000, or nearly one half of the popula 
tion, all of whom pay a tax to the  state. In the  same return it is reported that "The 
number of rural beggars throughout France amounted to four millions: also that the 
bread in common use among the peasant proprietors of plots of land, was a mixture 
25  of bran, rye, barley,  beans,  and potatoes; and that meat was rarely eaten by them 

except on two or three fete days of the year." 

In  1847  the  inspectors  of  Louis  Philippe  report  France  to  be  sub-divided  into 
11,511,841  little  estates,  each  paying  a tax of one-twelfth of the income; that only 
6,881  produced an income of £400 a year or upwards, and that the total amount of 

30  mortgages in all France was £501,760,000. 

M.Chegaray reports on April 29,1851, that "nearly the whole of the landowners 
in  France are bankrupts." These facts  speak for themselves, they require no com 
ment. But encumbrance is not the only difficulty that besets the peasant proprietor. 
He is  surrounded by obstacles in every direction, obstacles that increase in the same 
ratio as his capability of surmounting diminishes.

mortgagees, wanders out of the farmer's pocket into that of the mortgagee. We have 
seen how the equal division of property amongst the children, the least that the middle 
class nation of equality could do, has led to the encumbrance of the land, has forged 
new  shackles  for  the  peasantry,  and  thrown  the  independent  proprietors  into  the 
bondage of the moneyocracy. But the payment of interest is only part of the burden 
that oppresses the peasant proprietor. The modern mortgagee, like the baron of old, 
has his bailiff, his  scribe, and his lawyer, all of whom fleece the poor peasant before 
he  obtains his loan. First comes the appraiser, who issues a certificate verifying the 
situation, qualification, and value of the mortgager's estate. His service must be paid 
for.  Next comes the agent whom the farmer employs to find out a mortgagee.  Most  10 
of these agents act in a double capacity. They are employed by the capitalist to engage 
customers—the  customers  employ  them  to  find  dealers.  Their  demands  upon  the 
borrowers rise with the tightness of the mortgage market and the precariousness of 
the  security. Then comes the lawyer who makes out the pawn ticket, and lastly the 
registrar enrolling the transaction in the state's register. This cause of proceeding must 15 
be repeated as often as either the estates changes hands or the mortgagee recalls his 
loan, or expires. But this is not all. By sub-division, inter-marriage, purchases, etc., 
the properties become so intersected that one man's property is often scattered about 
over as many localities as he has acres. The proprietor of a hundred acres in one spot, 
can mortgage his estate by one single transaction; the proprietor of five acres in five  20 
different spots, if he mortgages at all, must pay five times. 

The transfer of property from father to son, from the seller to the purchaser, goes 
on  in  the  same  manner.  Every transfer of property  must be  legally registered,  and 
the more landed property is cut to pieces, the more it costs in the shape of lawyers' 
fees. These costs are unavoidable; they are part and parcel of, and inseparable from,  25 
the  system.  But, besides these, the peasant proprietors incur other law expenses to 
which  they often  maliciously  subject one  another.  As the properties become  more 
precarious, as poverty increases, there arise greediness, envy, and litigiousness. The 
disposal  of  land  by  will,  private  sale,  etc., by which relatives consider themselves 
to be defrauded, as  also the intersection of properties, gives frequent occasions for  30 
actions at law. The frequent and minute division of the soil presents permanent lines 
of  demarcation to be drawn, and  substantial barriers to be erected.  Hence there is 
always room for quarrels—always room to encroach upon one's neighbour. An honest 
and well disposed neighbour is indeed ablessing that can onlybe appreciated by those 
who are really conversant with such a state of things.  Talk about the buss of rural  35 
innocence.  Every little farmer is a living lump of suspicion and irritation.  Fleeced, 
plundered,  and  defrauded  on  all  sides  he  naturally  casts  a  suspicious  eye  upon 
everyone with whom he comes in contact. What the reactionists call rural innocence 
and  simplicity,  is  only  a  disguised name for an undeveloped and neglected  mental 
state,  a kind of unnatural idiotism, which is the more dangerous as it is inoculated  40 
and directed by the  sacerdotal hirelings of church and  state. The priests also exact 
their pound over  and above  their  salaries from  the state; but they exact their share 
in the shape of voluntary gifts for which the deluded dupes are promised to become 
particularly entitled to  a comfortable  seat in heaven. 

But  this  is  not  all.  Besides  the  mortgagee  and  his  attendants,  besides  the  ad-  45 

610 

The State of  France 

10 

ministrators of justice and the  shepherds of souls, there is a class of business men, 
who carry on their operations clandestinely, and positively speculate upon the farm 
er's  misery.  Among  all  men  of business the little farmer is  most in need of credit, 
and amongst all men of business the little farmer has the least. Bad harvests, inun-
5  dations, destructive hail storms, are all possible occurrences, and sufficient to make 
the little farmer  insolvent.  What security has  he to  offer? His estate? It is pledged 
to the utmost of its value to the mortgagee. His crop—the prospective reward of his 
toil?  One fatal  hour is sufficient to annihilate it. He has in fact, nothing to offer but 
an I  O U. Whenever, therefore, he wants goods or cash on credit, he must apply to 
those who carry on their business on the principle of "lose all or gain all"—the usurer 
and the tallyman. Thus he borrows on the worst condition. He has to pay the usurer's 
interest and the  sharper's profit.  Once fallen into their hands, it amounts almost to 
an impossibility to  extricate himself.  For, while his expenditure has been enhanced 
in consequence of the loan, his income has remained the same as before. The same 
15  cause  which  at first compelled him to  submit to unfavourable conditions is  still at 
work,  perhaps  even  in  a  more  aggravated  degree.  Thus  the  peasant proprietor  is 
slowly but surely handed over to the capitalist. Step by step his difficulties increase; 
step by step he gets deeper in debt; step by step he sinks into poverty and ruin. But 
all these transactions appear more beneficial than prejudicial to the farmer—they bear 
20 a sort of voluntary character, as the peasant himself agrees to the conditions on which 
the  individual  capitalists  get  hold  of  him  en  detail.  To  the  mortgagee  he  applies, 
because  he  wishes  to  possess  more  land  than  his  own  money  will purchase.  He 
invokes the law for the  sake of protection.  Without the usurer and the tallyman he 
would  often  be  compelled  at once  to  throw  up  his farm.  The priest is the  merciful 
25  mediator between him and God—the ladder upon which the pious farmer climbs to 
heaven,  when  death  bids  him  to  leave  his  troublesome  freehold,  if otherwise  the 
distrainer has not anticipated death, so that the farmer has nothing to leave. But the 
capitalists  appear yet under another name—viz., as the collective power of the state 
under which they seize upon the peasantry en gros, and peremptorily demand money 
in the  shape of taxes for which the peasantry receives scarcely any service, unless 
it be the surveülance of the gensdarmerie. What benefit does the peasant derive from 
the government expenditure? Education? The education of the poor would endanger 
the existing state of things. Protection by the army? He is not in need of it; the army 
is employed to keep the towns in check, and guards his oppressors. Assistance from 
the navy? The navy protects the floating riches of those who plunder him. To keep 
faith with the public creditor? The National Debt was not contracted for his benefit. 
He has no interest in keeping faith with the creditors. The whole of the state revenue 
is expended for the maintenance of interests which are totally foreign to the peasant. 
Nevertheless,  he  must pay—he  is  neither  consulted,  nor allowed to raise his voice 

30 

35 

40  against it. 

If  the  expenses  of  the  peasantry  are  progressively increasing,  and have  already 
brought the little proprietors on the brink of bankruptcy, the state has hitherto done 
nothing to mitigate the evil by public economy. On the contrary, just as if bankruptcy 
was  the  sole  end  of  state  administration,  the  respective  governments  have  been 
steering rapidly to  a point where the public expenditure far exceeds the resources 

45 

611 

Johann Georg Eccarius 

of  the  country.  In  less  than  forty  years,  with  a  pauperised  peasantry,  the  public 
expenses have been more than doubled. The cost of the respective governments, since 
the beginning of this century, runs thus:—Average annual expenditure during the reign 
of Napoleon, 750,000,000f. Average annual expenditure under the Bourbons, 1815-30, 
910,000,000f. Louis Philippe's "cheap" government (a bon marché) cost, during the 
first  twelve  years,  l,150,000,000f. per annum;  and in the latter years  the expenses 
amounted to  1,400,000,000. The honest Republicans who governed France in  1848, 
managed to carry on the affairs of the nation for 1,500,000,000f. The public expenses 
have considerably increased since then; but, as no new tax has been imposed upon 
the peasantry since  1848, this increased expenditure does not come under the head  10 
of the present inquiry.  Under the parliamentary rule  of the moneyocracy, the rural 
population contributed not less than fifty-seven per cent, of the whole public revenue. 
Thus the proprietors of land in France have to pay in the form of taxes to the state, 
and interest on mortgages to the bourgeoisie, a sum equal to £60,000,000 sterling per 
annum, exclusive of the heavy interest for occasional loans, tallyman's profits, and  15 
law expenses. 

5 

The guardians of the public purse, the honest and virtuous legislators, have proved 
quite as unscrupulous exactors as the barons of old. Nobody can consistently dispute 
the propriety of taxing real property, if the amount levied is in accordance with the 
requirements of the public service. But, in the case now before us there are open fraud 20 
and  robbery  committed.  Not  only  is  the  amount  of  taxation  levied  by  the  state 
exorbitant, but the peasant proprietor is actually compelled to pay taxes on land, of 
which he is only nominal proprietor. If A buys a farm for £1,000 and mortgages the 
same to Β  for £500 to pay the purchase-money, it is clear that A is in reality only 
proprietor of one half of the farm, having to pay interest for the full value of the other 25 
half. But the state never troubles itself about B. The taxgatherer is sent to A and A 
is enrolled as proprietor of an estate worth £1,000 for which he has to pay the full 
amount of taxes. A, therefore, pays one-half of the taxes as proprietor for himself 
and the other half he pays out of his earnings as farmer for B's share in the property. 
Now, as the mortgages on land in all France amount to more than £500,000,000, and 30 
as this sum  is necessarily included in the taxable value of land, it follows that the 
proprietors of land have to pay the taxes on that amount of property out of their 
industrial incomes for the mortgagees. This is robbery concocted by legislators, who 
only clothe  themselves  in the garb of legislation to  defraud the industrious with 
impunity. Brigand-like they have stifled the voices of their victims and shackled every 35 
limb  of  the  oppressed  to  paralyse  alike the political agitation and development. 
Legitimists, Orleanists, and Republicans have in succession adopted the same maxim 
of saddling the peasantry with as large an amount of taxation as possible; and this 
has been effected principally, because the rural population has  no means of re­
sistance.  Whether the new imperial regime will visit the peasant-proprietors with  40 
additional imposts, remains to be seen. Certain it is that, ere long, Loins Napoleon 
will have to increase the revenue by some means or other; since the income has not 
been adequate to cover even an average expenditure, much less the extravagance 
at present in vogue, which leaves no margin for a diminution of that share in the public 
burden hitherto borne by the peasantry.

Barrenness  of  the  Small  Farm  System. 

The  People's  Paper. 
Nr. 65, 30. Juli 1853 

5 

In the preceding articles we have seen the rustic citizen as proprietor, debtor, litigant, 
and  tax payer—a victim bound hand  and foot,  at the  mercy  of the  money-grubbing 
capitalists.  It  now  behoves  us  to  look  at  him  in his  capacity as a manufacturer of 
butter,  cheese,  beef,  mutton,  grain,  etc.—in  short,  as  a  provider  of  food  for  the 
nation. 

10 

There is an essential difference between the large farm system carried onto agreat 
extent in this country, and the prevailing small farm system in France. The large farm 
system is carried on upon commercial principles just like any other industrial under 
taking.  With the same end in view as the capitalist who invests his money in cotton 
mills,  the  large  farmer  starts  in  business by investing his  capital in the production 
of food.  Neither the  millowner nor the large farmer troubles himself about his own 
private  consumption—the  produce  of their  establishments  is  raised  purposely to be 
15  brought to market for  sale,  and whatever kind of goods'in their respective lines of 
business are most likely to have a good demand, they endeavour to supply. Bothmean 
profit.  Profit is the difference between the cost of production and the market price, 
and the market price dictates the business line of action to both. The only distinction 
between them is, that the one  accomplishes his purpose by the employment of the 
spinner  and  weaver—the  other  by  that of  the  ploughman  and  shepherd. Whatever 
tends  to  lessen  the  cost  of  production  increases  profit.  Consequently,  the  large 
farmer's  most  immediate  interest requires  that he  should  continually revolutionise 
and progressively change his mode of production, as new discoveries in science and 
inventions in mechanism afford the means for an onward move. The mode of cultiva-
tion under the large farm system is essentially modern, scientific, and progressive. 

20 

25 

The mode  of cultivation under the  small farm  system is, at best, an obsolete and 
stationary routine. The little farmer, starting in business, has not the same end in view 
as  the  large  one.  His  principal  aim is  to  secure employment and produce food for 
himself and family. He only thinks of taking his produce to market when he is fortu-
30  nate enough to reap a surplus, or when the tax gatherer, the collector of interest, and 

others,  press for payment. 

In  a  country  like  France,  where  nine-tenths  of  the  sou  are  cultivated  by  little 
proprietors, employment for wages is very precarious. Agricultural labourers, in the 
English sense, can hardly exist.  Those who perform  the functions  of labourers are 
35  either servants, single folks—hired by the year, or they are the poorest of proprietors 
whose farm  produce  is  not sufficient  to  maintain them  and their families, and who 
are  therefore  glad to  assist those  who  happen to possess  a few  square yards  more 
than they can manage themselves in the busy season. These occasional help-days are 
the only jobs which fall to  a married  man's lot. 

40 

As the principal object of small farming is employment of one-self and family, the 
small farm system excludes the use of all those modern implements which substitute 

613 

Johann Georg  Eccarius 

machine for manual labour.  The  small farmer's  income does  not consist in the dif 
ference between the cost of production and the market price. His revenue is the cost 
of production itself—it is the reward for his own hard labour. To cheapen production 
would be tantamount to reducing the money value of his own dear self. The applica 
tion  of  steam  power,  the  sowing,  the  reaping,  and  trashing  machine,  etc.,  would  5 
supersede manual—his own labour; it would depreciate the value of his sinews and 
bones. Hence the very existence of the small farm system depends on the old mode 
of cultivation being preserved. 

Those means of improvement and extensive cultivation, the development of which 
was  impeded by  the  feudal  system, were almost exhausted by the first generation  10 
of peasant proprietors. During the last twenty years the aggregate annual amount of 
agricultural produce has been stationary, no increase having taken place, except such 
as  has been occasioned by favourable  seasons.  All that plough, spade, and hoe can 
do, has been accomplished, and more the little proprietors cannot do. The application 
of some of the most profitable improvements, such as irrigation and drainage, which  15 
by no means depreciate manual labour is, on account of the smallness and intersection 
of properties, utterly impossible. But this is not all. The parent of good farming, the 
mother of fertilisation, is manure, a sufficient quantity of which can only be obtained 
from live stock; but the small farm system is as ill adapted for the extensive breeding 
and keeping of live stock as it is, for the application of machinery. In whatever light  20 
we  view  the  little  farmer's  position,  it  is  a  deplorable  one.  He  is  surrounded by 
insurmountable  obstacles  in every direction. 

To give  our  readers  an idea of the  scanty  supply of food obtained by the French 
nation from the prevailing system of farming, and also to show the difference between 
large  and  small farming, we quote the following statement of a French economist.  25 
M. Catineau la Roche says: 

"The  total  value  of  French  agricultural produce,  divided among all Frenchmen, 
gives each about 133 francs' worth. The total value of agricultural produce in England, 
would  give  each about 235 francs' worth. The French cultivator produces  a yearly 
value of 215 francs to the British cultivator's 715. In France, the annual production  30 
of a hectare is valued at about 105 francs. In this country it produces more than 244. 
The  wheat raised in France suffices only for two-thirds of the inhabitants. The rest 
live upon rye, maize, millet, potatoes, and chesnuts.

The result being that each Frenchman consumes about  WVîkil. of animal food." 
If this  estimate  be correct, 2 English oxen are equal to 3 French;  1 English calf, 
2 French; 1 English sheep, 2 French and 1 lamb; and one English lamb is more than 
three  French. 

La  Roche  calculates  that  this  country  possesses  2 oxen  to  one  in France;  and 
57 sheep to 32 in France. The smaller number of inferior cattle manure 43 millions 
of hectares in France. The greater number of superior beasts manure only 23 millions 
in this country. 

The  gross value of agricultural produce in France produced by a rural population 
of not less than 24 millions, is £1,880,800,000, while the gross value of agricultural 
produce  in England, produced by a farming population of not more than 6,000,000, 
is £139,356,875.  But there is no need of going to France for comparison. Before the 
Saxon invasion took place in Ireland—that is, previous to the last famine—there were 
in  the  sister  country  2,000,000  of  effective  toilers  employed to produce  an annual 
value of £48,020,834, while, in England, there were only 1,000,000 of effective workers 
engaged  to  produce  the  £139,356,875  worth.  The  whole  amount  of  animal  food, 
furnished by the French peasantry, would, at the London rate of consumption, only 
supply 5,430,000 people  with butchers'  meat.  Consequently, if the inhabitants  of a 
few of the largest towns in France would consume butchers' meat at the London rates, 
more than 29 millions and a half of Frenchmen would have to turn vegetarians at once. 
We must, however, take it for granted that the town population consumes rather more 
than an average  share. Therefore, the rearer of oxen,  sheep, pigs, etc., only enjoys 
their pleasant company while they are  alive and kicking, but rarely finds his dinner 
table  ornamented with any of these animals in a roasted  state. 

But it may be  asked, if the French nation is so scantily supplied with food? How 
did it happen that they exported such large quantities of wheat to this country in 1851? 
The reason is obvious. The rural population is two  to one of the town population— 
conseqpently  each  farming  family  has  only  to  supply  half  a  family.  In town  the 
average  number  of  customers  to each rustic individual is half a human being.  The 
home market for  agricultural produce is therefore very limited,  and it is quite con 
sistent with the existing state of things, that large quantities are exported, not for the 
benefit of the farmer, but at his expense. It has been already remarked that the little 
farmer only goes to market, when he has a surplus, or when pecuniary embarrassment 

615 

Johann Georg  Eccarius 

5 

compels him to sell what he ought to eat himself. In the latter case—which is at present 
the  rule—the  amount  to  be  disposed  of  depends  on  the  claims  which  state  and 
money-mongers have upon him,  as  well as on the market price of his produce. The 
more  abundant  the  harvests  the more  plentiful the return for  the farmer's  toil, the 
less  he  is  able  to  retain  for  himself.  The  most  abundant  harvests  leave  him  the 
least for his own consumption, since they result in a depression of the market price, 
far below what the  extra supply warrants. If, for instance, the extra yield of a good 
harvest be ten per cent, above an average one, the price of wheat is likely to fall twenty 
per  cent, below the average. Now if the farmer's average yield be  100 bushels per 
annum, of which he has to  sell,  say fifty bushels at five shillings each to satisfy his  10 
creditors,  he  will  retain fifty for his  own use.  Let the  yield of  an abundant  season 
rise  to  110  and  he  will  only be  able  to  sell  his  wheat  at four  shillings  per  bushel, 
consequently to satisfy his creditors he must sell 62V2 bushels which will only leave 
37V2 f°r his  own use.  Thus  a year of  abundance is a year of scarcity to the farmer, 
while  the  corn  merchant, being unable to dispose of the whole extra supply in the  15 
home market, will find  it profitable to  export that portion of the  produce  of which 
the  former  is  deficient.  One  would think that exportation  would keep up  prices  at 
home and prove beneficial to  the little farmer.  No  such thing. The little farmer has 
neither  an  opportunity  to  take  his  own  produce  to  market,  nor  can he  wait  until 
exportation begins; pressed for payment on all sides, in nine cases out of ten, he is  20 
obliged to sell his grain to the fore-staller as soon as it comes off the field. 

Whatever  impedes  the  production  of  an  ample  supply  of  food  is  injurious  to 
national welfare and prejudicial to the growth of population. Increase of population, 
as  experience  proves,  is  the mother of all industrial, social, and political progress, 
and whatever retards the growth of population is inimical to the welfare of humanity. 25 
The small farm  system is well adapted for a scanty population living in a semi-barba 
rous state, having few or no wants to satisfy, beyond the first necessaries of life. But 
it is totally incompatible with modern industry and a dense and growing town popula 
tion.  The  best  system  of  agriculture  is  that  which  subjects  the  smallest  possible 
number  to  rural  idiotism,  and  gives  the  largest  net  return  to  provide  for  a  town  30 
population.  The  less  hands  are required for the production of the first necessaries 
of  life,  the  more  are  left  to  administer  to  the  comforts  and luxuries of life. These 
conditions are best fulfilled by the modern large-farm system. The small-farm system 
neither makes its own peculiar product, the little farmer, happy, nor does it advance 
the  general  development  of  society.  It  is  neither  progressive in  itself,  nor  does  it  35 
provide adequate means of subsistence for the towns, the centres of all progress and 
development. Being incompatible with modern civilization it rapidly runs to its own 
ruin, extermination is its only solution—an Irish state of things is awaiting the French 
peasant  proprietors. 

It may be  objected  that the  large-farm  system  is carried on for the benefit of the  40 

few,  and that machine-power by  displacing manual  labour  acts prejudicially to  the 
interests of labour. Just so, but that does not make the mode of production a bad one; 
it  only  necessitates  a change in the  mode of distribution which it is the interest of 
the  working classes to bring about.  But as long as the land  and its fruits remain in 
the possession of private individuals, let us have the English large-farm in preference 45 

616 

The  State  of  France 

to the French small-farm  system. The influence of the latter upon the growth of the 
population  may be  seen from the following  statement:— 

From 1815 to 1842 the population of France increased only 18 per cent., and during 
that period with progressively  increasing  slowness;  in the  first eleven years 9 per 
5 cent. ; in the next nine years, less than 6 per cent. ; and in the seven years, from 1835 
to 1842,3 and 1-lOth per cent. The census of 1806 showed a populationof 29,107,425. 
In  1846,  according  to  the  census  of  that year,  it had only increased to  35,409,486, 
being an increase of little more than 21V2 per cent, in forty years. According, how 
ever, to official documents, the population of France in  1847 was  35,400,486, or in 
that year the progressive retardation noticed in previous years had become positive 
retrogression.  The  population  of  this  country  increased  between  1801  and  1851, 
98  per  cent.,  and  principally  in  the  towns.  Hence  we  conclude  that,  unless  the 
present  system  of  raising  food  is  done  away  with,  there  can  be  no  increase  of 
population  in  France.  The  only  thing  that  does  increase  is  beggary  which  has 
increased ten-fold  since the beginning of the present century.

gehört hat,  über  sie  zu  urtheüen.  Dieses  Blatt führt uns  seit  einiger  Zeit  groteske 
Spektakelstücke vor. Es gleicht einem überladenen, gebrechlichen Schiff lein, das von 
den Küsten  der alten Welt auf  Entdeckungsreisen auslief.  Das  Fahrzeug  sieht sich 
plötzlich  in  Mitte  der  hohen  See,  und  siehe  da,  man  hat  Kompaß,  Piloten,  und 
seekundigen  Kapitän  vergessen;  es  wird  zum  Spiel  der  Launen von Winden und  10 
Wellen.  Hier  versucht ein würdiger Alter der gedankenlosen Menge  den Ernst der 
Situation  zu  dociren;  allein  noch ist er nicht über das Evangelium hinaus,  als eine 
lachende Nymphe neckend in der Ferne sich zeigt und die erbauliche Andacht stört, 
indem sie sich an dem konfusen Treiben der Biedermänner weidet. Aus dem bunten 
Sammelsurium tritt Einer nach dem Andern auf das Hinterdeck, dreht und dreht am  15 
Steuer und stellt die Segel. Die allgemeine Verworrenheit wird nur gesteigert durch 
die direkt sich widersprechenden, aber allsammt wohlgemeinten Rathschläge, mittels 
deren  der  Pseudo-Kapitän  sich  abarbeitet,  die  Quadratur  des  Zirkels, die „höhere 
Einheit", den wahren, den richtigen Kurs nach Kanaan, der Milch- und Honig-Welt 
der  Zukunft  herauszuwickeln,  nachdem  er  soeben  noch in  seiner  Kajüte  sich  als  20 
zweiter  [Jean] Paul geträumt und gefühlt. 

Heute, wie im letzten Aufflackern der Kraft, wie [im] Todesröcheln, werden plötz 
lich  neue  und  größere  Segel  aufgezogen,  morgen  Erschlaffung wie  nach  der  Auf 
regung eines  verzehrenden Fiebers.  Die  Mannschaft refft, überarbeitet und zusam 
mensinkend, die Segel wieder ein. Man sucht sich die Konfusion des Getümmels aus  25 
dem  Sinn  zu  schlagen,  indem  man  „interessante"  Familienzwistigkeiten heraufbe 
schwört. Die Gegensätze der Wirklichkeit, in deren Mitte man sich ohnmächtig fühlt, 
sucht  man  zu  vertuschen,  indem  man  die  ausposaunte  „höhere  Einheit"  der  frei 
gemeindlich-idealen  Thätigkeit  aus  dem  Leim  gehen  läßt  durch  Dekretirung  der 
Gegensätze  von  europäischer  und  amerikanischer  Anschauung.  Der  atheniensische  30 
Bürger, dessen faule Gesinnungstüchtigkeit, dessen stolz über die Schulter geworfene

Das „beste  Blatt der Union"  und  seine  „besten Männer"  und  Nationalökonomen 

Wollenlappen man noch soeben in der Eigenschaft eines Kanzelredners der Freiheit 
bewunderte,  tritt  in  den Hintergrund und neue  Schauspieler treten vor.  Kann man 
von  ihnen erwarten,  daß  sie  begreifen,  die  bürgerliche Civilisation der Gegenwart 
ruhe auf der Sklaverei der Lohnarbeit, nachdem ein verwandtes Familienglied gestern 
5 im Dusel ganz und gar übersah, daß die antike Civilisation auf der absoluten Sklaverei 

fußte?  Gewiß  nicht.  -

Im  Kampfe  zwischen  der  „europäischen  und  der  amerikanischen  Anschauung" 
tritt  in  Sachen Europa's  auf:  „Leonidas"-Confusius-Ruge,  das  pommersche  Nord 
licht,  für  ein  Halbdutzend  im  Halbdunkel  tappender,  süddeutscher Diktatoren.  Er 
10  predigt bekanntlich ein Etwas,  das er Humanismus tauft, und läßt sich gelegentlich 
bei  John  Bull  neben  Strauß  und  Feuerbach  als  Triarier der deutschen Philosophie 
ausposaunen. Ruge's  „Anschauung" läßt sich kurz zusammenfassen. Er sieht in den 
Schriften  des  Philosophen  Kant  das  beschränkte  Freiheitssystem,  in  denen  von 
Fichte  das  Prinzip  der absoluten Freiheit, in denen von Hegel Prinzip und System 
15 der absoluten Freiheit vermittelst der Dialektik. Gegen die Dialektik hat Herr Ruge 
von jeher eine instinktmäßige Abneigung an den Tag gelegt, und blos ihre leichtere 
Seite aufgefaßt, diejenige nämlich, sich in Widersprüche zu verrennen, nicht aber die, 
sie  zu  bemeistern.  Es  ist  deßhalb  natürlich,  daß  er  die  Dialektik, z. B.  bei  Marx, 
fortwährend  als  Sophistik verlästert.  Seinen Humanismus bezeichnet Ruge als Ein-
fuhrung  von Prinzip und System der absoluten Freiheit in die Gesellschaft. Dieser 
Humanismus  des Herrn Ruge,  seine Einheit von Praxis und Theorie, soweit wir sie 
verstehen  können,  besteht  darin,  daß  er  den Praktikern gegenüber  seine faktische 
Unbeholfenheit  für  Theorie, und  den Theoretikern  gegenüber  seine  absonderliche, 
schwächliche Denkweise für Praxis ausgiebt. Von dem Augenblick an, als der Reihe 
25  nach Feuerbach, Bauer, Strauß etc. sich wechselseitig abgefertigt hatten, kein Fürst 
der Wissenschaft mehr existirte und nun gar die  Materialisten dazwischen [kamen] 
trat  bei  Vater  Ruge  ein  Gemüthszustand  [ein],  von  welchem  angesteckt  sein 
Uebersetzer ins Deutsch-Amerikanische einmal mit dem dummen Gretchen sagte: 

20 

30 

Mir wird von alledem  so dumm, 
Als  führ'  ein Mühlrad  mir  im  Kopf herum. 

Ruge  war  nämlich  gewöhnt,  den  jedesmaligen  Fürsten  der  Wissenschaft  dem 
Publikum möglichst laut anzupreisen, und dadurch eigene Berühmtheit zu erlangen. 
Aus  alledem  wurde  nun  eine  Olla  Pùtrida  von  Widersprüchen  zurecht  gemacht, 
welche  in Ermanglung der Dialektik in der neuesten Zeit mit einer demokratischen 
35 Stylsauce übergoßen wurde und als Loge des Humanismus zwar nicht im Welttheater, 
doch im Janus selig  ein „sehr ausgewähltes" Publikum grüßte, welches  sich leider 
beinahe gänzlich verlief, ehe  die  Loge fertig gezimmert war. 

40 

In der europäischen Presse hatte Herr Ruge sich während der letzten Jahre auf den 
Leader geworfen, redigirt durch seinen Freund Thornton Hunt in London, welcher 
folgerichtig im Janus als der „vorzüglichste Schriftsteller der englischen Sozialisten" 
gepriesen  ward.  Dieser  salbungsvolle Duckmäuser hatte  Kommunismus  gepredigt, 
um den Chartismus todtzumachen, weßwegen wir ihn schon damals in der amerika 
nischen  Presse  denunzirten.  Heute  steht die  Anklage gerechtfertigt da vor unserer 
Partei.  Hunt  hatte  sich  in  die  Chartistenexekutive  gedrängt  mit  der  Absicht,  die 

619 

Adolf  Cluß 

Chartisten  den  Finanz-Reformern  (der  industriellen  Bourgeoisie)  in  die  Hände  zu 
spielen. Um Ernest Jones in die Falle zu locken, predigte er inmitten der glänzendsten 
Prosperität  und  der ungünstigsten  Sachlage  physische  Gewalt und wollte nur noch 
von  Büchsen  wissen,  er  wurde  zum  Lohn  aus  jener  offiziellen  Stellung  bei  den 
Arbeitern herausgeworfen. Gut! Heute hat der Schuft die Maske abgeworfen. Er ist 
Einer der respektabelsten Schwäzer der Mittelklasse geworden, erklärt Bright, dieses 
Ideal  des  modernen  engüschen  Bourgeois  für  den  ächten  „old  Englishman"  und 
uninteressirtesten  Humanitätsschwärmer  zu  Gunsten  des  unglücklichen  indischen 
Volkes, und meinte kürzlich, daß er selbst den Despotismus einer „tollen Republik" 
vorziehe.  So jämmerlich nimmt sieh die aufgeblasene  „höhere Einheit" aus, hinter  10 
der sich Arroganz in ihrer breiten Seichtigkeit brüstet, wenn sie in wirkliche Konflikte 
verwickelt  wird!

Die  Reform. 
Nr. 49, 17.September 1853 

Gehen wir jetzt über  auf  die  „amerikanische  Anschauung", welche  den Gegenpart 
des Familien-Krawalls in der Neu-England-Zeitung darstellt. Der größte Theil dieser 
Anschauung besteht aus Trivialitäten und neuerdings aus Gassenhauersentenzen, die 15 
augenscheinlich in Kneipen, unter dem Einfluß von Philadelphier Lagerbier zusam 
mengeflochten,  das  Material  zur  Füllung  einer  Dunggrube  abgeben,  deren  Umfas 
sungswände mit Unwahrheiten, Gemeinheiten und Gemeinplätzen zusammengekittet 
sind.  Ein paar Philadelphier Römer, vorzüglich ein gewisser Herr Pösche, welcher 
soeben damit umgeht, sich die Epauletten zu verdienen, als Klaqueur Cushings, in  20 
der  Pierce'schen glorreichen Aemterjägerarmee, floriren als  Matadore dieser Rich 
tung. Eine ökonomische Theorie, konservativ-bürgerlich, so wie sie von den Sozialen 
aller Fraktionen direkt bekämpft wird, — diejenige des Amerikaners Carey und des 
Franzosen  Bastiat  wird  dem  gläubigen  Publikum*)  als  neueste  deutsch-amerika 
nische  Entdeckung,  als  die  „höhere Einheit" der National-Oekonomie  vorgeführt.  25 
Wir werden sehen, daß überall, wo  sich die hochtrabende höhere Einheit ins wirk 
liche Leben wagt, sie den Gewalten,  welche sind, als dienstbereites Werkzeug in die 
Hand arbeitet. Die Redaktion der N. E. Z. scheint ihre keusche Gesinnung noch nicht 
befleckt  zu  haben  durch  Studien,  so  mühvoll  materieller Art, wie  national-ökono 
mische  sind;  denn  wir  sehen  täglich,  daß  [...]  Diskussion  sozialer  Fragen Jedem  30 
in die Hä[...], welcher gerade Lust hat, sich zu entleeren. Die obenberührte Doktrin 
erlag mit Herrn Bastiat das letztemal vor den sozialistischen Tribunalen Europa's im 
Jahre  1849 bei einer Polemik in Proudhon's  „Voix du peuple"; das Dahinrollen der 
Geschichte  hat jenen theoretischen  Ausdruck für  eine  genau bestimmte  geschicht 
liche  Epoche  längst  Grund  und  Boden in der europäischen Gesellschaft entzogen.  35 
In  Amerika,  wo  heute  die  gesellschaftlichen  Gegensätze  noch  viel  unentwickelter 
sind, als im radikal unterwühlten Europa, fand diese Theorie ihren Vertreter in dem 
Oekonomen  Carey.  Ihr  konservativ-bürgerlicher  Gegner  (vom  Standpunkt  der 

*)  Nach dem  anhaltenden Nothschrei der N. E. Z. und den laufenden Gerüchten scheint das 
Publikum übrigens eine voreilige  Hypothese geworden zu  sein A. C 

40 

620 

Das „beste  Blatt der  Union"  und  seine  „besten  Männer"  und  Nationalökonomen 

neueren  englischen  Schule  aus)  hat  sich  auch bereits  gefunden  in Prof.  Wayland. 
Seine  National-ökonomischen  Prinzipien  sind  auf  den  meisten  Akademien  Neu 
Englands  als  Lehrbuch eingeführt,  zum  großen Verdruß  der  Anhänger  Carey's. 

Resumiren  wir  kurz  die  Hauptlinien  der  Doktrin,  welche  von  Bastiat  in  seinen 
5  Sozialen Harmonien mit Grazie und in leichtfaßlicher Form zusammengestellt, von 
Carey  aber ohne  alles  Darstellungstalent,  ohne  Zusammenfassungsgabe  und Präzi 
sion  propagirt wird.  Mancherlei  positive  Kenntnisse  und  selbst originelle  hübsche 
Einfälle sind dem C. H. Carey nicht abzusprechen. Sein Hauptverdienst besteht darin, 
daß er wirklich ein eigenthümliches, dem amerikanischen Boden direkt entwachsenes 
10 Produkt ohne fremde Beimischungen ausbildet. Seine Wissenschaft ist nichts weniger 
als universeller Natur, sie ist eine reine Yankeewissenschaft. Sie versucht darzuthun, 
daß die óto/jom/sc/jen Bedingungen der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft, statt Bedingungen 
des  Kampfes und des Antagonismus zu sein, vielmehr Bedingungen der Assoziation 
und  der  Harmonie  sind.  (Sehr  schön  in  der  Theorie,  die  Praxis  hierzu liefern die 

15  modernen Fabrikstädte!) Jene ökonomischen Bedingungen zerfallen in 

20 

1) Rente,  den  Antheil  des  Grundeigenthümers, 
2)  Profit, den Antheil des  Kapitalisten, 
3)  Arbeitslohn, den Antheil des Arbeiters an dem  Werthe des fertigen Produkts. 
Wir sehen, Carey ist zu erfahren, um, wie z. B. die neugebackenen Römerjünglinge 
in Philadelphia, oder vor ihnen s. v. Heinzen, die Existenz von Klassen an das Dasein 
von politischen Privilegien und Monopolen zu knüpfen und deßhalb mit der großen 
französischen  Revolution  die  soziale  Harmonie  unbedingt  improvisirt und für  alle 
Zeiten  patentirt  zu  sehen.  Carey  sucht  vielmehr  für  die  ökonomische  Thatsache 
ökonomische Gründe, wobei er freilich nicht hinauskömmt über die noch undeutlich 
25  ausgeprägten,  verschwimmenden, in Fluß begriffenen amerikanischen Klassenver 
hältnisse. Er beweis't deßhalb nur, daß ein Durchgangspunkt in der Entwickelung der 
Gesellschaft ihm für das NormalverhältnißihiQs Lebens gilt. Am charakteristischsten 
ist  die  Polemik  von  Carey's  Schule  gegen  die  englischen  Oekonomen.  Sie  greift 
Ricardo, den klassischen Vertreter der Bourgeoisie und den stoischsten Gegner des 
30  Proletariats, an als einen Mann, dessen Werk das Arsenal für Anarchisten, Soziali 
sten, kurz für alle „Feinde der bürgerlichen Ordnung" sei. Sie verfolgt mit Fanatismus 
wie  Ricardo,  so  auch  alle  übrigen leitenden  Oekonomen des  modern-bürgerlichen 
Europas und  wirft diesen ökonomischen  Herolden  der Bourgeoisie vor, daß sie die 
Gesellschaft  zerrissen  und  für  den  Bürgerkrieg  Waffen  schmieden  durch  den  mit 
35  Cynismus  gelieferten  Nachweis,  daß  die  ökonomischen  Grundlagen  der  verschie 
denen Klassen einen nothwendigen und stets wachsenden Antagonismus unter ihnen 
hervorrufen  müssen. 

Bastiat,  der  Franzose,  ist  unbedingter  Freihändler;  die  Phiiadelphier  Römer 
jünglinge  beten ihm  die  „Segnungen  des  Freihandels"  mit gläubiger  Einfalt  nach. 
40  Carey selbst fing  seine  ökonomische  Carriere als  Freihändler an, und ließ zu jener 
Zeit hier und da gute Witze vom Stapel, wie z. B. das bürgerliche Frankreich seiner 
Schutzzollneigungen  halber  mit  China  zusammenzustellen.  Wie  gewöhnlich  bei 
Freihandelsmännern,  schob  er  alle  Dissonanzen in  der Gesellschaft auf ungebühr 
liches Einmischen des Staates in Unternehmungen, welche der Privat-Industrie etc. 
45  zukämen. Dies war Alles Yankee, Yankee von Kopf zu Fuß. Heute ist Herr Carey 

621 

Adolf  Cluß 

säuerlich  geworden,  seufzt  und  jammert  mit  dem  Franzosen  Sismondi über  die 
zerstörenden Wirkungen in der zentralisirenden großen Industrie England's, welche 
für  ihn  das  „böse  Prinzip"  in  der  Gesellschaft  erzeugt.  Er  würde  sich  höchlich 
wundern, wenn er wüßte, wie deutsche Grünschnäbel im lawinenartigen Anschwellen 
der  Macht  des  großen  Kapitals die Herausbildung von Schneeballen sähen, erfüllt 
von  „anglosächsischen"  Dezentralisations-  und  Individualitäts-Geist.  Abgesehen 
davon,  daß  Carey  den  revolutionären,  umwälzenden  Moment  in  den  destruktiven 
Wirkungen der Industrie gänzlich übersieht, ist er dennoch wieder zu sehr Yankee, 
um  die  Industrie,  als  solche,  verantwortlich  zu  machen,  was  die  einzige, richtige 
Konsequenz  seines  Raisonnements  wäre.  Er  macht  die  Engländer  persönlich ver-  10 
antwortlich  für  die  Wirkungen  ihrer  Industrie,  gar  nicht  davon  zu  sprechen,  daß 
Ricardo  wieder  verantwortlich  gemacht  wird  für  England.  In  diesem  Gegensatze 
befangen, muß  er  sich nach und nach nothwendig immer weiter hineinarbeiten in's 
Kleinbürgerliche, in die einmal dagewesene, aber längst verdrängte patriarchalische 
Assoziation von Agrikultur und Manufaktur. 

5 

15 

Der Yankeewitz bei Carey und seinen Anhängern ist nun aber wiederum der: Unter 
dem  Vorwande  und,  wir  mögen  es  zugeben,  auch  mit  dem  guten Willen und  der 
Ueberzeugung, für die  „zahlreichste und leidendste Klasse" aufzutreten, werfen sie 
der englischen Bourgeoisie den Fehdehandschuh hin.  Sismondi that dies, indem er 
die moderne Industrie verdonnerte und sich nach der alten Manufaktur zurücksehnte ; 20 
sie  aber thun es, indem sie heute  den Schutzzoll predigen.  Sie wollen demnach im 
Grunde mit all'  ihren philanthropischen Phrasen blos die  englische  Entwickelung 
der  industriellen Bourgeoisie in Amerika künstlich  beschleunigen.  Es ist dies eine 
philanthropisch-utopische Manier im Kampf der Konkurrenz zwischen England und 
Amerika, diesem höchst interessanten Phänomen für die bürgerliche Oekonomie der  25 
Gegenwart. Die geniale  Seite  der Oekonomie zeigt sich hier  auf's  Glänzendste. Da 
diese  sogar  von  Carey's  Schule  gänzlich übersehen  wird,  so wäre es natürlich ein 
unbilliges  Verlangen,  wenn  wir  bei  Staatshämorrhoidarius  und  neugebackenen 
Staatsökonomen  der  Neu  England  Zeitung  auch nur  eine  Ahnung hiervon voraus 
setzen wollten, da sie im bürgerlichen Koth bis über die Ohren versunken, noch nicht 30 
einmal  entfernt  die historische  Bedeutung  der  Richtung kennen,  welche  sie  selbst 
auswendig gelernt haben. 

Die  Reform. 
Nr.50, 21.September 1853 

Im  Konkurrenz-Kampf  zwischen  Amerika  und  England  sehen  wir  nämlich  das 
letztere mehr und mehr in die Lage Von Venedig, Genua und Holland gedrängt, welche 
alle  gezwungen waren,  ihr  Kapital  auf Zinsen auszuleihen, nachdem das Monopol  35 
ihrer  Handelsmacht  gebrochen  war.  Genua und Venedig haben Holland zum Auf 
kommen  verholfen,  Holland  hat  England  mit  Kapital  versehen,  und  ebenso  ist 
England jetzt gezwungen zu thun in Bezug auf die Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika. 
Nur  sind  heute  alle  Verhältnisse  in  diesem  Umschwung  riesenhafter  als  damals. 
England's Lage unterscheidet sich von der Lage jener Länder dadurch, daß bei diesen 40 
das Monopol des  Handels der vorherrschende Moment war, was leicht zu brechen 

622 

Das „beste  Blatt der  Union"  und  seine  „besten  Männer"  und  Nationalökonomen 

ist, während jenes das Monopol der Industrie zugleich besitzt, was seiner Natur nach 
zäher  ist.  Die  Uebersättigung  an  Kapital  von  England's  Bourgeoisie  ist  dafür  an 
dererseits um  so kolossaler, so daß sie gezwungen ist, Eisenbahnen in beiden Welt-
theilen  zu  bauen,  Kapital  in  Berliner  Gasbeleuchtung,  in  die  Weinberge  von 
5  Bordeaux,  in russische  Fabriken und in  amerikanische  Dämpfer  zu  stecken.  Dies 
Alles  giebt  Stoff  zu  der  interessantesten  Beobachtung,  wie  die  Anziehungskraft, 
welche  das  englische  Centraikapital  ausübt,  nothwendig  sich  ergänzt  in  einer 
Centrifugalkraft,  welche  es  nach  allen  Ecken  der  Welt  wieder  ausströmt.  Eine 
Revolution — und  die  Engländer haben  dem europäischen Kontinent all jene Ver-
10  bindungswege  und  Maschinerie  für  die  Produktion  umsonst  hergestellt.  Amerika 
wartet  nicht auf Revolutionen; es macht seine Abrechnung auf konservativ-bürger 
lichem  Wege  ab,  indem es  sich von Zeit zu Zeit mit England durch den Bankerott 
liquidirt. Dies ist Eines der Geheimnisse seines raschen Auf Schießens, eine regelmä 
ßige  Erscheinung,  ebenso  wie  Eisenbahn- und Dampfboot-Katastrophen.  Dieselbe 
15  Sorglosigkeit, derselbe rasende Produktions-Taumel, welcher ermöglicht, daß Zehn 
tausende ins Dasein gerufen werden, die unter andern Umständen nie das Licht der 
Welt  erblicken  würden,  überliefert  kaltblütig  Hunderte  auf  Hunderte  per  Dampf 
einem  frühen  Tode.  Das  Eine  ist  blos  die  Ergänzung  des  Andern.  Unskrupulöse 
Multiplikation  des Reichthums der Kapitalisten-Assoziationen mit völliger Hintan-
setzung von Menschenleben! so lautet das Kommentar zum  „Sieg der Individualität 
im  Angelsachsenthum!"  Dies  Alles  sind  Thatsachen,  freilich  unbegreiflich  der 
„nüchternen Prügelscheu  und  der  hausbackenen Verständigkeit" von Philadelphier 
Römer jungens, welche ausgeklugt haben aus irgend einer konservativen Review, daß 
die Arbeiterinnen von Lowell  heute  in ihrem Verdienst dreimal besser sich stehen, 
25  als vor 30 Jahren. Nach diesem klugen Schluß müßten jene Arbeiterinnen vor Zeiten 
blos 4V2 Tag in der Woche Speise zu sich genommen und ihre Blöße höchstens mit 
einem Feigenblatt bedeckt haben. Daß innerhalb 30 Jahren überhaupt erst entstanden 
oder  von  einer  geruhig  vegetirenden  Bevölkerung  von  200 Seelen  sich  auf  eine 
Fabrikstadt von 36000 Seelen heraufgearbeitet hat,  daß heute  etwa der dritte Theil 
30  dieser  Bevölkerung  aus  Arbeiterinnen  besteht*),  welche  bei einem Durchscnnitts-
wochenlohn von drei Dollars von der Hand zum Munde leben, d. h., deren Lohn um 
diesen Durchschnittspreis  herum  derart  steigt und fällt,  daß  sie in günstigen Zeiten 
einen  Pfennig in  die  Sparkasse niederlegen können,  welchen sie zu Zeiten, wo  die 
Geschäfte  gänzlich  stocken oder  nur  halbe Zeit gearbeitet wird,  wieder  aufzehren, 
35  daß  diese  Arbeiterinnen  größtentheüs  nicht  durch  demokratische  Verordnungen, 
wohl aber durch die Macht der Verhältnisse zum Cölibat verurtheilt sind; dies Alles 
sind  Sachen,  welche  ein  „demokratischer"  Aemterjägerkandidat  nicht  sehen  darf, 
wollte  man  sogar annehmen, er hätte die  nöthige Sehkraft. 

20 

Die  „Gleichheit der Möglichkeiten für das Individuum, über die hinaus man (d. h. 
40 die Phüadelphier Römer) nichts zu sehen vermag" können wir hier in Amerika f reilich 
nicht läugnen; das gelbe Fieber hat lange genug als römisch-demokratischer Kommis 
sär agirt und sie in New-Orleans demonstrirt. Die  Möglichkeit der Gleichheit aber, 

*)  Lowell's  Bevölkerung wird  zu fünf Achttheilen aus Weibern zu drei Achttheilen blos  aus 
Männern angegeben. Wir glauben, faktisch ist das Mißverhältniß noch viel greller. A. C.

junger  Herr,  liegt  jenseits  des  bürgerlichen  Gesichtskreises,  nur  der  von keinerlei 
Vorurtheilen umzäunte weitere Horizont des Reformers schließt sie ein, welcher die 
modernen Arbeiterverhältnisse  in ihrer  ganzen Tragweite  erkannt hat. 

Nachdem  wir jetzt die Helden einer jeglichen Welt  skizzirt, bei dem  Helden der 
neuen  Welt  aber  vorgezogen  haben,  die  National-Oekonomie  in  Original  zu  be- 
sprechen, deren matten, farblosen Abklatsch er wiederkäut, (wir thaten dies, um das 
dem Publikum  schuldige Dekorum beobachten und die personifizirte Langeweile in 
ihrer  Monotonie, die  verflachte  Gelahrsamkeit in ihrer  Düsterkeit unterbrechen zu 
können)—müssen wir noch bemerken, daß jede von beiden Parteien die andere grober 
Unwissenheit in der Weltgeschichte  zeiht (was wir einfach registriren) und daß die  10 
Redaktion  diese  rührenden,  „interessanten"  Szenen  zuweilen  auch  einen  „Kampf 
von  Materialismus  und  Idealismus"  tauft,  wobei  Heinzen  in  der  alten Maske  des 
Orlando Furioso  als  Gevattermann auftritt.

Die  Fehde  hatte  einen  hohen  Grad  von  Heftigkeit  erreicht  und  das  Spiel  der 
gegnerischen  Argumente  schien  sich  eher  in  Fäusten verdichten,  als  in  die  sehn-  15 
süchtig gehoffte  „höhere Einheit"  auflösen zu wollen.  Es wurde also eine schieds 
richterliche  Einheit  improvisirt,  ein  Deus  ex  machina  zitirt  in  der  Person  eines 
„ernschten"  Mannes,  einen  ehemaligen  Diplomaten und Gesandten einer Duodez 
republik, wenn anders die hochbetheuernde Staatsweisheit und die völkerrechtliche 
Grandezza  uns  nicht  total  trügen,  welche  in  den  vorsichtig  zurückhaltenden  Ur-  20 
theilssprüchen überall den Mann verrathen, welcher schon jetzt unter dem Druck der 
Regierungslast  der  Zukunft  seufzte.  Er  schlichtet  den  „Kampf"  zur  allseitigen 
Zufriedenheit;  denn  beide  Parteien  bekommen  Unrecht,  so  daß  keine  einen  un 
ehrenvolleren Rückzug zu nehmen hat, als die andere. „Leonidas" geht friedfertig, 
wenn  auch  noch  zuweilen  mürrisch  grunzend,  einher  neben  seinen  Gegnern,  den  25 
„unbekannten  Griechen",  deren  Rolle  die  Philadelphier  Römerjünglinge  in  der 
Komödie übernommen hatten. Das Chor der Priester des Humanismus singt gerührt: 
„In  diesen  heiligen  Hallen,  kennt man die  Rache  nicht!"  Der Vorhang fällt, allein 
keine bengalische  Flamme röthet das patriotische Tableau, die Schlußszene kommt 
noch.

Demokrit  sich  über  alles  Lustige  lustig  zu machen und nach allen Indizien glaubt, 
im ganzen Kampfe  sei gar viel Geschrei und spottwenig Wolle zu Markte getragen 
worden.  Er  moquirte  sich  über  die  ganze  Erfindung  des  speziell-demokratischen 
Verstandes,  welcher  sich  die  Revolution  nicht  anders  als  unter  den  am  Draht ge-  40 
zogenen  „feurigen Höllenhunden"  des  Europäischen Centralkomites  denken kann.

Er beruhigt Ihro  Herrlichkeiten,  sie  sollten  sich nicht vor  Baschkiren furchten, die 
Preußen und Baiern seien auch nicht so übel, erklärt ihnen, wie ohne das Knäsenthum 
seiner  Fürsten,  ohne  die  landesübliche  Sammlung von Pickelhaubenjünglingen mit 
oder ohne Äffensteißkokarde, Deutschland eine Chance auf Baschkiren gehabt haben 
5  möchte,  kichert  über  die  zärtliche  „revolutionäre"  Besorgniß  für  die  National-
Unabhängigkeit  der  36 Landesväter,  der  Preußischen,  Bückeburgischen,  Darm 
städtischen oder Badischen Regierungen und den Vorzug, welcher Reichstruppen — 
Reichstruppen für die  „deutsche Nation" — vor Baschkiren gegeben wird. Er lacht 
über  den  Schauder  vor  den  drohenden  Baschkirenüberschwemmungen,  über  das 
10 feierliche Gepolter, den Staatsweisheitskram, die sittlich-nationalen Manifeste an die 
preußisch-badischen Knäse, wie diesen an's Herz gelegt wird, daß sie die 36 Vater 
länder mit ihrem halb und halb Despotismus ja treu gegen die Baschkiren bewahren 
sollen,  damit  nur  nicht  der  große  Konflikt  vor  der  Zeit  heraufbeschworen werde, 
welchen  die  Demokraten  erst  auf  das  50. Jahr  nach Napoleon's  Prophezeiung er-
15  warten, die sie aber nimmermehr bei Lebzeiten überkommen darf. Er lacht über das 
ohnmächtige,  absurde  Bemühen  demokratischer  Sekten,  die  ganzen  bestehenden 
Konvulsionen  der  europäischen  Gesellschaft,  die  ganze  ungeheure  geschichtliche

Dir  geschätztes  Blatt  hat  zur  großen  Freude  meiner  Gleichgesinnten,  welche  als 
Kosmopoliten dem „Gott der Magyaren" ebenso wenig dienen, als sie dem „Gott der 
Russen" sich zu Füßen legten, mit anerkennungswerther Unabhängigkeit allein in der 
5  Presse  die  Vertheidigung  unseres  verdächtigten  Führers  Szemere unternommen. 
Erlauben  Sie  mir  gefälligst,  einige  Bemerkungen beizufügen, von welchen das Pu 
blikum  meines  Wissens  wenig  Kenntniß hat.  Sie sollen zeigen, wie absurd die Be 
hauptung,  wie  niederträchtig  die  Verleumdung,  unsern  braven,  anspruchslosen 
Freiheitskämpfer  als  Verräther,  und  nun  gar  als  gekauften  Verräther,  der  Partei 
10  vorzuheucheln. Das letztere Faktum entlarvt die Triebfeder seiner Anfeinder; denn 
bei  einem  so  erprobten  Vaterlandsfreunde, wie er, könnten gewiß nur die unange 
nehmsten  persönlichen  Verwicklungen  diesem  Ansinnen  auch  nur  bei  Ununter-
richteten den Schein von Wahrscheinlichkeit geben. 

20 

Szemere hat die Tochter eines (nun gestorbenen) österreichischen Hof agenten, so 
15 nämlich heißen die Staatsprokuratoren in Ungarn, zur Frau. Ihr Vater war sehr reich. 
Während  der  ganzen Revolution  1848—49 lebte Madame  Szemere bei ihrer Mutter 
in Wien und hatte  alle Verbindung  mit ihrem Gemahl abgebrochen, wahrscheinlich 
mit seinem Einverständniß. Ende  1849 starb die alte Schwiegermutter und Madame 
Szemere, gegen welche natürlich nichts vorlag, verkaufte unter der Hand ihr Eigen-
thum und verwandelte es in baares Geld. Alte Bekanntschaften ihres Vaters mögen 
ihr  dabei  behülflich  gewesen  sein;  denn  in  Oesterreich  kann man  für  Geld  Alles 
erhalten.  Nachdem  Frau  Szemere  ihr  Vermögen  flüssig  gemacht  und  in  sichere 
Wechsel  auf's  Ausland  umgesetzt,  ließ  sie  sich  einen  Paß  für  einen  preußischen 
Badeort geben, reiste  aber  statt dahin, nach London und von da nach Paris, um die 
25  Verbannung ihres Ehegatten zu theilen. Die Herren Oesterreicher aber haben Nichts 
in Händen, woran sich ihr Fiskus vergnügen könnte. Die banale Verdächtigung, daß 
Szemerè Reste  seines Vermögens aus dem Schiffbruch nachträglich zu retten suche, 
wird  schon hierdurch zur unsinnigen Lüge. 

Die Ereignisse der letzten Jahre haben uns Vorsicht gelehrt, so zwar, daß wir von 
30  Natur  schon  durchaus  nicht  mehr  zu  übergroßem  Vertrauen geneigt  sind,  am we 
nigsten, wo  es  sich um  offizielle Größen von  1848—49 handelt; allein mit Szemere 
steht die Sache anders. Sie haben seine Charakterbilder gelesen und müssen gewiß

helden erklärt sich hinlänglich aus der Schärfe, mit der er ihre Hohlheiten aufdeckt, 
und aus dem ausgezeichneten Geschick, mit dem er die Waffen des Geistes handhabt. 
Szemere  ist  Vielen unserer  Landsleute  weit voraus.  Seine  Schriften  sind dem vor-

Nr. 103, 8. Dezember 1853 

London, 18. Nov. 1853. 

(Korrespondenz.) 
Die  Londoner  Neuigkeitskrämer  sind  gegenwärtig  vollauf beschäftigt.  Die Türken 
sind der Diplomatie aus dem Sack gesprungen und haben bereits bewiesen, daß sie 
5  nicht allein auf eigenen Füßen stehen, sondern auch marschiren, sich Bahn brechen, 
und  die  Russen  schlagen können.  Dieselben Türken,  die vor Kurzem noch als  das 
entnervteste  Volk  der  Welt  angesehen  wurden,  dasselbe  Volk,  dessen  nationale 
Existenz  keine  andere  Garantie  zu  haben  schien,  als  die  Unmöglichkeit  einer 
Uebereinkunft  der  Großmächte,  sein  Territorium  unter  sich  zu  theilen,  hat  den 
10  übermüthigen  Czar  bereits  gedemüthigt  und  jene  Theilungssüchtigen,  welche  die 
Lebensfähigkeit  der  Türkei  mit  dem  Maßstabe  ihrer  eigenen  Abgestumpftheit  ge 
messen,  auf die unangenehmste Weise überrascht. Alle Nachrichten, welche bisher 
vom  Kampfplatze  eingetroffen  sind,  stimmen  darin  überein,  daß  die  Russen  ge 
schlagen und  ihre  Versuche, den Türken Widerstand  zu leisten,  vergebens  sind. 

15 

20 

In dem  Gefecht bei Oltenitza, welches am 4.  stattfand, hatten die Russen gegen 
3000 Todte,  worunter  14  höhere Offiziere.  Fast sämmtliche Bataillonschefs,  sowie 
verschiedene  Obristen  sind  verwundet.  Es  scheint, daß es  Leute in der türkischen 
Armee  gibt,  die  etwas  von  Scharfschützerei  verstehen und  ein  besonderes  Wohl 
gefallen  darin  finden,  die  russischen  Offiziere  ihre  mörderische  Kunst  fühlen  zu 
lassen.  Die  russischen  Offiziere  dagegen  entschädigen  sich  durch  summarische 
Verurtheilung und Erschießung von malcontenten Polen im russischen Heer. 

Selbst  wenn  die  weiteren  von  Wien  mitgetheilten,  etwas  fabelhaft  klingenden 
Siegesnachrichten sich nicht bestätigen sollten, so haben die Türken doch schon am 
4. genug gethan, um sämmtliche diplomatische Intriganten außer Fassung zu bringen, 
25  die Alles aufgeboten haben, die Pforte auf's Neue auf den schlüpfrigen Boden der 
Unterhandlung  zu  ziehen.  In  Cirkassien  spielt  das  Schicksal  noch  ärger  mit  den 
barbarischen Welteroberern. Nach Briefen aus Trebisonde haben Schamyl's Truppen 
20000 Rüssen überwältigt; was nicht todt geschlagen ist, ist gefangen genommen. 

Wie  sehr große  Männer den Eindrücken von wichtigen  Ereignissen unterworfen 
30  sind, hat der alte Aberdeen, der Friedensminister à tout prix, auf dem Lord Mayors 

Dinner, am 9. d. M. verrathen. 

Die  Friedenspredigt,  welche  er  an die versammelte  Freß- und  Sauf-Gesellschaft 
an demselben Tage hielt, wo die Londoner Zeitungen die ersten Nachrichten von der 

629 

Johann Georg  Eccarius 

Oltenitzer  Schlacht brachten,  schloß er mit der nachdrücklichen Versicherung, daß 
seine  Friedenspolitik keineswegs  die  Unmöglichkeit eines  Kriegs  in sich schließe. 
Glückliches Land, das ein so großes Genie  an der Spitze  seiner Regierung hat. 

5 

Weniger erfreulich, als die Nachrichten aus dem Orient, lauten die Berichte über 
die  Streitfragen zwischen  Arbeiter und  Kapitalisten im  Norden von  England.  Die 
Arbeiter haben ihre Rechnung ohne den Wirth gemacht. Noch vor einigen Monaten 
hing der Prosperitätshimmel voller Geigen, der Erfolg, welcher zahlreiche Versuche 
zur  Erhöhung des Arbeitslohnes während des  Sommers begleitete, machte die Ar 
beiter kühn;  sie glaubten,  sie hätten die Fabrikanten in der Tasche, aber sie hatten 
sich getäuscht.  Anstatt den Arbeitslohn zu erhöhen, fangen die Fabrikanten schon  10 
wieder  an,  denselben  herabzusetzen.  Die  Bourgeois  Zeitungen  hatten  wiederholt 
erklärt,  daß  die  Baumwollen-Fabrikanten  genöthigt  seien,  ihre  Produktion  zu be 
schränken.  Es  konnte  daher  nichts  Vernünftigeres  kommen,  als  ein Vorwand, die 
Fabriken  einige  Zeit zu  schließen,  um  den Arbeiter  zur Vernunft zu bringen.  Die 
Arbeiter waren den Kapitalisten schon längere Zeit zu frech mit ihren Forderungen  15 
gegenüber getreten, daß  sie nicht die erste Gelegenheit hätten ergreifen sollen, der 
gleichen Belästigungen ein Ziel zu  setzen. 

Wenn  die  Arbeiter  noch  irgend welche  Hoffnungen hegen,  ihre  Differenzen mit 
den  Kapitalisten  und  der  von  denselben  beherrschten  bürgerlichen  Gesellschaft 
auszugleichen,  so  können sie durch nichts leichter zur Besinnung gebracht werden,  20 
als gerade durch die neueste Verfahrungsweise der Kapitalisten. Schon im Laufe des 
Sommers hatten sich die Baumwollenlords in Assoziationen zusammengeschaart, um 
weiteren  Lohnerhöhungen zu widerstehen.  Die  Ausführung eines  Handstreichs im 
Großen  schien  das  beste  Mittel,  den Arbeitern auf einmal den Garaus  zu machen, 
und als, nachdem es schon zur Gewißheit geworden, daß die Märkte überfüllt waren, 25 
die  Arbeiter  noch  auf  weitere  Lohnerhöhung  Anspruch  machten,  und  in  einigen 
Fabriken sogar die Arbeit niederlegten, beschlossen die assoziirten Fabrikanten ihre 
Fabriken einen Monat lang zu  schließen. 

In Folge dieses Beschlusses sind gegenwärtig in Lancashire von 70-80000 Fabrik 

arbeiter  auf  das  Pflaster  geworfen.  Durch  dieses  Verfahren werden  verschiedene  30 
Zwecke  auf  einmal erreicht. 

Die  Arbeiter  werden von  allen Hülfsmitteln  entblößt,  fremde  Hülfe wird, wenn 
nicht gänzlich abgeschnitten, auf ein Minimum reduzirt, die Unterstützung von Seiten 
der Gemeinden, auf welche die Arbeiter während einer Geschäftsstockung Anspruch 
machen können, wird unter dem Vorwand des Ungehorsams verweigert, und was die  35 
Hauptsache ist, nachdem die Arbeiter so bis auf's Aeußerste heruntergebracht sind, 
werden  die  schlechtesten  Bedingungen  zum  Wiederbeginn  der  Arbeit  gestellt.  In 
Preston, wo gegen 25000 Personen brodlos sind, haben die Fabrikanten bereits ihre 
Bedingungen  gestellt, unter welchen  sie gesonnen sind,  die  Fabriken wieder zu er 
öffnen: nämlich 10 Prozent weniger, als sie vor dem 1. März d. J. bezahlten, während 40 
der Brodpreis  fast  das  doppelte ist. 

Die  Arbeiter  in  den  Kohlenminen fahren nicht besser.  Die Minenbesitzer gehen 
bereits damit um, das Beispiel der Cottonlords nachzuahmen. Ein Korrespondent der 
Daily News schreibt: The colliers of Wigan have been fairly starved into the surren 
der.

D a v id  U r q u h a r d t. 

In  einer  der  mit  den  letzten  Dämpfern  uns  zugekommenen  englischen  Zeitungen 
finden  wir  zu  unserem  Staunen  Herrn D. Urquhardt,  in der neuesten Zeit vielfach 
genannt als Agitator für die russenfeindlichen Meetings in England, als ein Werkzeug 
im  Dienste Rußlands bezeichnet.  Wir können uns diese Widersinnigkeit nur durch 
Ränke des „freien Slaventhums" erklären, denn ganz Europa hat Urquhardt bis heute 
blos  als  eingefleischten,  bis  zur  Manie  gehenden  Russenfeind  und  Türkenfreund 
gekannt. Als Gesandtschaftssekretär in Konstantinopel suchten die Russen ihn sogar 
erwiesenermaßen  zu  vergiften.  Deshalb  einige  Worte  über  einen  Mann,  dessen 
Namen  Jeder  im  Munde  führt,  über  dessen  Bedeutung  aber fast  Keiner  sich  Re-  10 
chenschaft  zu  geben weiß. 

5 

Urquhardt  reitet  systematisch  auf  einer fixen  Idee.  Während  20 Jahren  hat  er 
erfolglos den Palmerston und die russischen Pfiffe und Kniffe denunzirt und mußte 
deßhalb  natürlich  halb  verrückt  werden,  wie  jeder  Mensch,  der  eine  bestimmte 
richtige Idee hat, mit welcher er aber in der Welt nicht durchdringt. Die Möglichkeit,  15 
daß  Palmerston  mit  seiner  Diplomatie  sich bis heute halten konnte, erklärt er  sich 
aus dem Krakehl der Whigs und Tories, was zum Theil, aber wohlverstanden nur zum 
Theil, richtig ist.  Gegen das heutige englische Parlament, welches jede Sache nicht 
nach ihrem eigenen Verdienst, sondern einzig nach dem Maßstab von „im Amt"oder 
„ausser Amt" schäzt, sieht er — da er von Haus aus konservativ ist — keine andere  20 
Rettung, als Verstärkung der königlichen Prärogativen auf der Einen Seite und lokale, 
municipale  Selbstregierung auf  der  andern.  Um  gegen Rußland  Front zu machen, 
wünscht er, der Westen möge eine ebenso kompakte, einförmige Masse büden, wie 
die russische.  Er wül daher nichts  von Parteien  wissen und ist ein Hauptfeind von 
Centralisationsbestrebungen. Da die bisherigen Revolutionen,  seit  1848, momentan  25 
Alle  dem  Fortschritt  Rußlands  günstig  waren,  schiebt  er dies Resultat verrückter 
weise  der  russischen  Diplomatie  als  ursprüngliches  Motiv in den Kopf.  Rußland's 
Agenten sind daher in Urquhardt's Idee die geheimen Haupüeiter der Revolutionen. 
Da  innerhalb  des  konservativen,  alten  Systems  Oesterreich  das  direkte  Gegen 
gewicht  gegen Rußland büdet,  so  zeigt er Vorliebe für Oesterreich und Abneigung  30 
gegen Alles, was Oesterreich's internationale Macht gefährden könnte. Im Gegensatz 
einerseits  zum russischen, andererseits zum revolutionären Nivellement hält er fest 

632 

David  Urquhart 

5 

an der Individualität und besondern Eigenthümlichkeit der Völker. In seinen Augen 
sind  daher  die  Juden,  Zigeuner,  Spanier  und  Muhamedaner  mit  Einschluß  der 
Tscherkessen die vier famosesten Völker, weil sie von der Plattheit (vulgarism) von 
Paris  und  London  nicht angefressen  seien.  Man  sieht  aus  alledem,  daß  seine  Ge-
schichts-Auffassung  eine  sehr  subjektive  Natur  annehmen  mußte;  die  Geschichte 
erscheint ihm mehr oder minder als  das ausschließliche Werk der Diplomatie. Was 
die  objektive,  die  materielle  Geschichts-Auffassung  angeht,  so  meint  er,  das  sei 
dasselbe,  als  wolle  man  die  Verbrechen nicht vor  Gericht bringen,  sondern  sie zu 
Gesetzen  generalisiren.  „Er ist ein ehrbarer, obstinater, wahrheitsliebender, begei-
10 sterter, in starken Vorurtheilen sich abarbeitender, total vernunftwidriger alter Herr", 

wie ein Kritiker von ihm sagt. 

Da  er  aber  nur  eine  Lebensaufgabe  hat, den Kampf gegen Rußland, welchen er 
mit monomanischem Scharfsinne und vieler Sachkenntniß führt, so schadet das Alles 
nichts. Der Ritter einer Lebensaufgabe muß nothwendig wieder „der edle Ritter von 
15  der traurigen Gestalt"  sein und auch an Sancho Pansa's fehlt es ihm nicht, hier wie 
in Europa. Ein modifizirtes Exemplar dieser Species produzirt sich in „A.P.C. "dem

The  People's  Paper. 
Nr.86, 24. Dezember 1853 

The  Coalition Cabinet  is  a "Coalition" no longer—it has been a conspiracy against 
liberty throughout its  existence—it is a disruption of effete factions falling to pieces 
with their own decay.  No  external pressure—no  stormy movement—but, as we pre 
dicted,  inherent rottenness  has  made  them tumble to pieces.  Lord Palmerston has 
been the first to resign. Why has he done  so? "His known hostility to all Reform." 
We  do  not think this a sufficient cause—for Lord John's Reform Bill is not likely to 
be  anything  so  comprehensive  as  to  shock even  the  tender  susceptibilities  of  the  10 
sacrificer  of  Poland,  Hungary,  Italy,  Portugal,  or Turkey.  The  real  cause must be 
sought  deeper. 

5 

Lord Palmerston, as shown in the masterly articles of Dr. Marx, has ever been the 
friend, and ever acted like the tool of Russia. At the present moment, the irresistible 
force of circumstances is impelling peace-loving Aberdeen himself into a European  15 
War—at least, there will be great difficulty in avoiding  such a consummation. 

"This will never do," says Russo-Palmerston, "British interference must be avoid 

ed, at all hazards." 

How can he accomplish this ? Not by remainting in the ministry, certainly. He would 
be either out-voted or forced to conform to the views which compulsion from without 20 
would necessitate his colleagues to take. He resigns therefore—by so doing he weak 
ens—he embarrasses the ministry—and just at the most critical period—he necessitates 
their spreading dissolution—or, if they patch up are-constructed "coalition" he stands 
as an "independent opposition" in the house, to impede their every movement—he 
can oppose them, as going too far, or he can oppose them by pretending they do not 25 
go  far  enough-and  thus,  either  way,  prevent  them  doing  anything  against Russia. 
Perhaps, then, he may form a ministry himself, stepping in after all the mischief has 
been  effected—after  the  irremediable  blow  has  been  struck—accepting  as  "a  great 
fact"  what  has  been done  by Russia—throwing all  the blame of what he  himself  in 
reality caused on the shoulders of his predecessors-getting all the popularity himself  30 
by saying: "Ah! if I had been Prime Minister it would have been very different"—and 

634 

Secret Intrigue of Russian Tools,  and  Scandalous  Doings of "Our"  Cabinet in the  East 

then,  in  the  midst  of  panic,  dull  trade,  and  starvation being  allowed  to conclude 
dishonourable terms with Russia, on the plea of reviving commerce which will have 
been wounded past revival. 

Such, we strongly surmise, from our knowledge of the man's character, is the plot 

5  of the Ex-minister. It is a Russian manœuvre, on the eve of an Anti-Russian war. 

If we  cast our eyes  from  the Downing Street intrigues of this despicable Cabinet 
to its conduct at the seat of war, fresh cause is afforded of unmitigated disgust. With 
a cowardly carnage unsurpassed for baseness and bloodthirsty treachery in the annals 
of "civilised" warfare, the Russians have sunk thousands of Turks in the sea by their 
10  over-powering  artillery brought to  bear  on comparatively defenceless  ships—some 
say, aided by the felonious hoisting of the British flag. If this latter report should prove 
correct—instant atonement should be demanded by Great Britain for this desecration 
of her flag on the foul mast of a Russian pirate. But, what have the British Government 
done?  Has  "our"  fleet rolled  its  terrible  thunder  over  Sebastopol—or  sunk the re-
turning freebooters in sight of their own shores? No; two steamers have gone sneak 
ing to the scene of action—not daring to say, "We go to protect our weak alley"—not 
presuming to  render  warlike help—oh no!  that  might give offence to Russia—but as 
floating  chemists  shops,  to  carry  medicines to  the wounded, which it is hoped for 
the  sake of that humanity for which he is so celebrated, the Czar will allow them to 

15 

20  do. 

What puts  the conduct of the British Government in a still more degrading light 
is, that actually, after the two  steamers had been sent into the Black Sea, with the 
beggarly excuse that it was not to interfere, but only to help the wounded, when the 
Austrian Ambassador had the astounding insolence to demand an explanation of the 
25  act,  it had  the  meanness  to  give  the  humiliating assurance that nothing hostile  or 
offensive was intended! A Russian war steamer followed the English ships, to watch 
their motions wherever they went. No "explanation" of that was demanded, although 
the Black Sea is  a Turkish and not a Russian water. 

Moreover, we are informed that the allied fleet, if it does enter the Euxine will go 
30 "merely to prevent a collision between the Russian and Turkish navies"~the practical 
meaning of which will be  that the  Turks will be ordered not to defend themselves, 
forbidden to  sail in their own  seas,  and the  Russians allowed to have everything to 
themselves. 

, The Sultan has naturally now claimed the promise made to him, viz., that the fleets, 
35  having been sent to assist him,  should be placed at his disposal when required. He 
has  said "I require it." He has sent for the ambassadors and admirals. And what do 
these say in reply? "We dare not act—we must send for instructions to our respective 
Governments." 

Before the messengers can reach St. James's and the Tuileries, before answers can 
40  be returned, every Turkish ship may be  sunk, 20,000 or 30,000 Muscovites may be 

landed on the  shores of Asia-Minor in the rear of Selim and Abdi Pashas. 

Wait  for  instruction!  What a  Government must that be, that sends  ambassadors 
and fleets to Turkey in such a crisis, and does not in its instructions provide for the 
contingency! The meerest child in statesmanship would have done so—ifit had been 
45 honest. Common sense would have told them that, as Russia and Turkey were at war, 

635 

Ernest Jones 

and  the  respective fleets of both countries were cruising in the Euxine, a collision 
would ensue—and the ambassadors and admirals ought to have been instructed how 
to act in such an emergency. Men who have not got an amount of forethought slight 
as that, are not fit to manage the affairs of a hen roost, to say nothing of our empire. 
But it is not forethought they stand in want of. They are cunning enough. They have 
intentionally tied down their representatives  and officers—they have given them too 
many  instructions,  instead  of  too  few,  and  one  of  them  has  evidently been  to  do 
nothing. 

This  course  is  not pursued in every instance. This childish powerlessness of self-
faction, this prohibition of all discretionary power does not always characterise our 
envoys  and  naval  officers.  But then,  the  cases  must be  different.  A  Commodore 
Lambert, on the shores of Burmah, has discretionary power enough to plunge Britain 
in  the  most  harrassing  and  injurious  war  she  has  undergone  for  ages—and why? 
Because a merchant did not immediately get £90, and a subordinate officer was kept 
standing for  a  quarter  of  an  hour  in the  sun.  But here, when the British  fleets  are 
contemptuously thrown into the shade, when a veteran and honourable ally is threat 
ened  with  destruction—when  a barbarous  butchery with  shamfully disproportioned 
force is  perpetrated almost under our own eyes, the  Admiral of England's greatest 
fleet,  and  an  Ambassador  of  the  very  highest rank,  have not the power of  a puny 
commodore,  and of  a subordinate  officer who is  sent on a message! 

This speaks for itself. Will not the British people speak too, and in unmistakeable 
language  put  an end to this  disgraceful mixture  of imbecility  and treachery,  which 
now  rules  the  destinies  of  our  mighty  empire,  and  impedes  the  liberation of  the 
world?

The  London  Times, which during the  Hungarian contest, was  distinguished for  its 
Austro-Russian articles, has not intermitted its malignity toward Kossuth, as appears 
from the following incident noticed in our columns  on Friday: 

In its number of the  15th April The Times stated that "the house in the occupation 
of M. Kossuth" had been searched by the authorities, in virtue of an order from the 
Home  Secretary,  and  that a great  quantity  of  arms,  munitions,  and  other warlike 
materials had been found. And thereupon The Times proceeded to read a long homily 
to Kossuth, including such sentences as this:  "All that we have learned hitherto of 
the  character of M.Kossuth,  of his conspiracies  and ridiculous juggleries,"  and so 
forth,  in an equivalent  strain of ridicule  and obloquy.

Now  it  appears  that  no  such  house  in  the  occupation  of  M. Kossuth  has  any 
existence, but the foEowing are the facts:  Mr. Hale, the inventor of a certain rocket, 
(used in our Mexican war, by the way,) at Rotherhithe, had been visited by Kossuth 
15  before  and  after  he  came  to  America.  On  his  first visit he  had  suggested  certain 
improvements  to  Mr. Hale, and after his return to  England Mr. Hale  called on him 
and stated that his suggestion had been applied with success. Subsequently, according 
to  The Daily News, 

"A Hungarian soldier,  a deserter from the Austrian army, caEed on him  seeking 
20 charity. M. Kossuth having ascertained that the man had had some experience in the 
Austrian  artillery,  and  subsequently  in  the  chemical  department  of  the  sanitary 
establishment, thought that he might be suited to the work of Mr. Hale's factory, and 
accordingly recommended him to that gentleman for employment. The man was taken 
on, but, in consequence either of his inattention or misconduct, was shortly afterward 
25  dismissed; and it is just possible, that out of revenge, he rushed to the Home Office, 
and hoaxed its astute chief with the cock-and-buE story of the Old House at Rother 
hithe,'  and  M. Kossuth's  mysterious  manufacture  and  accumulation of projectiles. 
It  must be repeated that this is only conjecture, and may possibly involve an unjust 
accusation  against  a true-hearted  Hungarian." 

30  Mr. Hale  has  written  a letter  protesting against the police entry of his premises, 
stating that "no gunpowder and not an arm of any kind was found except the rockets ; 
Lord Palmerston boldly asserting that arms were found, and 500lbs. of powder, which 
is  a gross  fabrication." 

639 

Dubiosa 

Notwithstanding these facts The Times has a second article in the same accusatory 

spirit as the first, commencing as follows: 

5 

"In spite of the strenuous and repeated efforts of Sir Joshua Walmsley, Mr. Thomas 
Duncombe,  Mr. Bright, Lord Dudley Stuart, and the friends and patrons of M. Kos 
suth, to  elicit from  Lord Palmerston a disavowal or  contradiction of the  statement 
published by this journal on Friday last, the Secretary for the Home Department said 
nothing to  shake,  in any important particular,  the  accuracy of our information.  In 
using the  expression, 'a house in the occupation of M. Kossuth,' we never intended 
to  describe  his  dwelling-house, because  we  were  aware that this  seizure had been 
made  at  a manufactory in or near Rotherhithe, while M. Kossuth lives at Bayswa-  10 
ter... Whatever may hereafter be proved on behalf of M. Kossuth, the essential facts 
of this case remain unexplained, and very much in need of explanation. It is undoubt 
edly true, that upon the entry of the police on these premises near Rotherhithe they 
found  upwards  of  70 cases  closely  packed,  and  containing,  apparently  for  trans 
mission to a distance, several thousand war rockets, besides a considerable number  15 
of rockets in a state of preparation, 2,000 shells not as yet loaded, and 500 lbs. of 
gunpowder. These are Lord Palmerston's own words in describing the seizure effect 
ed by the police ; and it will not be denied that these particulars establish the existence 
of  an  extraordinary  case,  which fully  justifies  the  curiosity  of  the  public  and  the 
interference  of the Government." 

20 

When  The  Times was about to turn its memorable and historical somerset on the 
free  trade  question,  there  was  a  meeting  of  the  proprietors,  and the question was 
discussed  as  to  the  reason or  apology which it should give  therefor.  After a  flood 
of discussion, the chief proprietor rose and said: The Tïmesnever retracts or explains ; 
and, accordingly, the next day it appeared on the other side in politics, without a word 25 
of explanation.  So goes the story. The persistence in its original view of the rockets 
is in keeping with the above.

P e r s ia  a nd  E n g l a n d. 

In announcing the declaration of war by the Shah of Persia against the Turkish Sultan, 
we copied from  The London  Times a statement that Persia has fallen entirely under 
"Russian  control;"  but  since  our  London  cotemporary  fails  to  explain  how  that 
5  country  has  become estranged from the influence of Great Britain, we will  supply 

the  deficiency.  It includes  some  singular historical facts. 

In  1811,  England bound herself, by the  treaty of Teheran, negotiated with Persia 
by Sir Harford Jones Brydges, to maintain Persia on her then footing of independence, 
against Russia  and  all  other  powers. Persia, on her  side,  stipulated that she would 
10  not enter into any relations with European nations, or with any power whatever, to 
the detriment or prejudice of the British Indian Empire. The stipulations of that treaty 
were  faithfully  kept  by  Persia.  England  violated  them  at  first  in  1826,  when  she 
allowed  Russia  to  extend  her  territory  to  the  frontier  of  the  Araxes.  And  Lord 
Palmerston, from 1830—1841, did all in his power to supplant the British influence in 
the Persian councils by Russian influence, as we proceed to  show. 

15 

At the time when the noble Lord came into office, the Russians were so detested 
in  Persia  that they  were  scarcely  able to find a footing for their Consuls  or agents 
in  any  part  of  the  kingdom.  In  Hamadan,  for  instance,  permission to  reside  was 
secured to them only upon the application and remonstrances of the British Envoy. 
20 So complete was the British ascendancy in Persia at that time, so complete the distrust 
and suspicion of Russian designs. In 1831 the menaces of Lord Palmerston prevented 
Persia from succouring the insurrection in Poland, disgusted the mind of Abbas Mirza, 
the Crown Prince, whose march to the Russian frontier he had intercepted, and thus 
disposed  him  and  his  house to look less  unfavorably  towards  their former enemy, 
25  Russia, than towards Great Britain, their unfaithful ally. On the death of the Crown 
Prince,  Russia, with the  aid of Palmerston,  set aside the next heir to the crown of 
Persia, who, according to the usage of that country, was the eldest surviving son of 
the  reigning  Shah,  and  replaced  him  by  the  son  of  Abbas Mirza, the Governor of 
Azerbijan, a province bordering on the Russian territory, this Prince having already 
30  agreed  to  exchange  the  English  for  the  Russian  alliance.  This  transaction  deeply 
compromised  the  independence  of Persia,  and had the  effect of giving to the  Czar 
a direct voice in the alteration and new arrangement of the succession to the Persian 

641 

Dubiosa 

monarchy.  Aided by British forces, the Russian nominee was  enabled to vanquish 
and put to death his competitor, the lawful heir, and place himself on the throne of 
Persia. 

This  was  in  the  year  1834;  and  subsequently the noble Lord made it his  system 
to leave the British Envoys at Teheran entirely without instructions ; or so to instruct 5 
them  as  to  leave  them  entirely  unprovided  to  meet  any  foreseen  or  unforeseen 
emergency. They had, moreover, one standing direction given them, which was this: 
that they were in all  cases to  act in conjunction with the Russian Envoy. Dispatch 
after dispatch—some times as many as twenty consecutive dispatches—were received 
in Downing-st. from the British Envoys in Persia, beseeching information and advice, 10 
and the  necessary powers to proceed.  But the answer of Lord Palmerston—when it 
came—was, invariably: "I approve of what you have done, and I shall waitfor further 
information from you before I  send you further instructions." In the meantime they 
are  directed  by  him  to  continue to  act upon the instructions already received. But 
these  were  that  they  must  act  in  conjunction  with the  Russian  Legation—that is,  15 
concur in the measures which Russia might think fit to take. Thus it appeared to Persia 
that Russia alone was active, that England did nothing, except to concur with Russia, 
and  that  accordingly  it  behoved  Persia  to  secure  a favorable position with Russia 
alone. In Central Asia it is therefore said to this day that Russia and England are united 
on the terms of sovereignty and vassalage:  the Czar of Russia being said to be the  20 
suzerain and the Queen of Great Britain to be the vassal. The Russian Envoy, Count 
Simonien,  actually  advised  and  headed  an  expedition  of  the  Persian  army against 
Herat,  with the  avowed object of making that the first step toward the conquest of 
Candahar, of Cabul, and finally of Delhi itself. The first intimation to Lord Palmerston 
of the design to attack Herat was conveyed in a dispatch from Mr. Ellis, in November, 25 
1835.  And  notwithstanding the earnest and frequent entreaties  of Mr. Ellis  and Sir 
John  McNeill for instructions to lodge with the Czar protest against the expedition, 
the date of the noble Lord's first instructions is July 27,1838, when the Herat expedi 
tion had already been brought to an ignominious end. This proves conclusively the 
cooperation of  the  late British Minister in the work of Russian aggrandizement.
